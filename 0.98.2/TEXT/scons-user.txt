Preface

   Thank you for taking the time to read about SCons. SCons is a
   next-generation software construction tool, or make tool--that is, a
   software utility for building software (or other files) and keeping
   built software up-to-date whenever the underlying input files change.

   The most distinctive thing about SCons is that its configuration files
   are actually scripts, written in the Python programming language. This
   is in contrast to most alternative build tools, which typically invent
   a new language to configure the build. SCons still has a learning
   curve, of course, because you have to know what functions to call to
   set up your build properly, but the underlying syntax used should be
   familiar to anyone who has ever looked at a Python script.

   Paradoxically, using Python as the configuration file format makes
   SCons easier for non-programmers to learn than the cryptic languages of
   other build tools, which are usually invented by programmers for other
   programmers. This is in no small part due to the consistency and
   readability that are built in to Python. It just so happens that making
   a real, live scripting language the basis for the configuration files
   makes it a snap for more accomplished programmers to do more
   complicated things with builds, as necessary.
     __________________________________________________________________

1. SCons Principles

   There are a few overriding principles we try to live up to in designing
   and implementing SCons:

   Correctness
          First and foremost, by default, SCons guarantees a correct build
          even if it means sacrificing performance a little. We strive to
          guarantee the build is correct regardless of how the software
          being built is structured, how it may have been written, or how
          unusual the tools are that build it.

   Performance
          Given that the build is correct, we try to make SCons build
          software as quickly as possible. In particular, wherever we may
          have needed to slow down the default SCons behavior to guarantee
          a correct build, we also try to make it easy to speed up SCons
          through optimization options that let you trade off guaranteed
          correctness in all end cases for a speedier build in the usual
          cases.

   Convenience
          SCons tries to do as much for you out of the box as reasonable,
          including detecting the right tools on your system and using
          them correctly to build the software.

   In a nutshell, we try hard to make SCons just "do the right thing" and
   build software correctly, with a minimum of hassles.
     __________________________________________________________________

2. A Caveat About This Guide's Completeness

   One word of warning as you read through this Guide: Like too much Open
   Source software out there, the SCons documentation isn't always kept
   up-to-date with the available features. In other words, there's a lot
   that SCons can do that isn't yet covered in this User's Guide. (Come to
   think of it, that also describes a lot of proprietary software, doesn't
   it?)

   Although this User's Guide isn't as complete as we'd like it to be, our
   development process does emphasize making sure that the SCons man page
   is kept up-to-date with new features. So if you're trying to figure out
   how to do something that SCons supports but can't find enough (or any)
   information here, it would be worth your while to look at the man page
   to see if the information is covered there. And if you do, maybe you'd
   even consider contributing a section to the User's Guide so the next
   person looking for that information won't have to go through the same
   thing...?
     __________________________________________________________________

3. Acknowledgements

   SCons would not exist without a lot of help from a lot of people, many
   of whom may not even be aware that they helped or served as
   inspiration. So in no particular order, and at the risk of leaving out
   someone:

   First and foremost, SCons owes a tremendous debt to Bob Sidebotham, the
   original author of the classic Perl-based Cons tool which Bob first
   released to the world back around 1996. Bob's work on Cons classic
   provided the underlying architecture and model of specifying a build
   configuration using a real scripting language. My real-world experience
   working on Cons informed many of the design decisions in SCons,
   including the improved parallel build support, making Builder objects
   easily definable by users, and separating the build engine from the
   wrapping interface.

   Greg Wilson was instrumental in getting SCons started as a real project
   when he initiated the Software Carpentry design competition in February
   2000. Without that nudge, marrying the advantages of the Cons classic
   architecture with the readability of Python might have just stayed no
   more than a nice idea.

   The entire SCons team have been absolutely wonderful to work with, and
   SCons would be nowhere near as useful a tool without the energy,
   enthusiasm and time people have contributed over the past few years.
   The "core team" of Chad Austin, Anthony Roach, Charles Crain, Steve
   Leblanc, Gary Oberbrunner, Greg Spencer and Christoph Wiedemann have
   been great about reviewing my (and other) changes and catching problems
   before they get in the code base. Of particular technical note:
   Anthony's outstanding and innovative work on the tasking engine has
   given SCons a vastly superior parallel build model; Charles has been
   the master of the crucial Node infrastructure; Christoph's work on the
   Configure infrastructure has added crucial Autoconf-like functionality;
   and Greg has provided excellent support for Microsoft Visual Studio.

   Special thanks to David Snopek for contributing his underlying
   "Autoscons" code that formed the basis of Christoph's work with the
   Configure functionality. David was extremely generous in making this
   code available to SCons, given that he initially released it under the
   GPL and SCons is released under a less-restrictive MIT-style license.

   Thanks to Peter Miller for his splendid change management system,
   Aegis, which has provided the SCons project with a robust development
   methodology from day one, and which showed me how you could integrate
   incremental regression tests into a practical development cycle (years
   before eXtreme Programming arrived on the scene).

   And last, thanks to Guido van Rossum for his elegant scripting
   language, which is the basis not only for the SCons implementation, but
   for the interface itself.

Chapter 1. Building and Installing SCons

   This chapter will take you through the basic steps of installing SCons
   on your system, and building SCons if you don't have a pre-built
   package available (or simply prefer the flexibility of building it
   yourself). Before that, however, this chapter will also describe the
   basic steps involved in installing Python on your system, in case that
   is necessary. Fortunately, both SCons and Python are very easy to
   install on almost any system, and Python already comes installed on
   many systems.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.1. Installing Python

   Because SCons is written in Python, you must obviously have Python
   installed on your system to use SCons Before you try to install Python,
   you should check to see if Python is already available on your system
   by typing python at your system's command-line prompt. You should see
   something like the following on a UNIX or Linux system that has Python
   installed:
       $ python
       Python 2.2.2 (#1, Feb 24 2003, 19:13:11)
       [GCC 3.2.2 20030222 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-4)] on linux2
       Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
       >>> ^D

   And on a Windows system with Python installed:
       C:\>python
       Python 2.2.2 (#34, Apr 9 2002, 19:34:33) [MSC 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
       Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
       >>> ^Z

   The >>> is the input prompt for the Python interpreter. The ^D and ^Z
   represent the CTRL-D and CTRL-Z characters that you will need to type
   to get out of the interpreter before proceeding to installing SCons.

   If Python is not installed on your system, you will see an error
   message stating something like "command not found" (on UNIX or Linux)
   or "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
   operable progam or batch file" (on Windows). In that case, you need to
   install Python before you can install SCons.

   The standard location for information about downloading and installing
   Python is [184]http://www.python.org/download/. See that page for
   information about how to download and install Python on your system.

1.2. Installing SCons From Pre-Built Packages

   SCons comes pre-packaged for installation on a number of systems,
   including Linux and Windows systems. You do not need to read this
   entire section, you should only need to read the section appropriate to
   the type of system you're running on.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.2.1. Installing SCons on Red Hat (and Other RPM-based) Linux Systems

   SCons comes in RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) format, pre-built and
   ready to install on Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core, or any other Linux
   distribution that uses RPM. Your distribution may already have an SCons
   RPM built specifically for it; many do, including SuSe, Mandrake and
   Fedora. You can check for the availability of an SCons RPM on your
   distribution's download servers, or by consulting an RPM search site
   like [185]http://www.rpmfind.net/ or [186]http://rpm.pbone.net/.

   If your Linux distribution does not already have a specific SCons RPM
   file, you can download and install from the generic RPM provided by the
   SCons project. This will install the SCons script(s) in /usr/bin, and
   the SCons library modules in /usr/lib/scons.

   To install from the command line, simply download the appropriate .rpm
   file, and then run:
        # rpm -Uvh scons-0.96-1.noarch.rpm

   Or, you can use a graphical RPM package manager like gnorpm. See your
   package manager application's documention for specific instructions
   about how to use it to install a downloaded RPM.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.2.2. Installing SCons on Debian Linux Systems

   Debian Linux systems use a different package management format that
   also makes it very easy to install SCons.

   If your system is connected to the Internet, you can install the latest
   official Debian package by running:
        # apt-get install scons
     __________________________________________________________________

1.2.3. Installing SCons on Windows Systems

   SCons provides a Windows installer that makes installation extremely
   easy. Download the scons-0.95.win32.exe file from the SCons download
   page at [187]http://www.scons.org/download.html. Then all you need to
   do is execute the file (usually by clicking on its icon in Windows
   Explorer). These will take you through a small sequence of windows that
   will install SCons on your system.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.3. Building and Installing SCons on Any System

   If a pre-built SCons package is not available for your system, then you
   can still easily build and install SCons using the native Python
   distutils package.

   The first step is to download either the scons-0.98.2.tar.gz or
   scons-0.98.2.zip, which are available from the SCons download page at
   [188]http://www.scons.org/download.html.

   Unpack the archive you downloaded, using a utility like tar on Linux or
   UNIX, or WinZip on Windows. This will create a directory called
   scons-0.98.2, usually in your local directory. Then change your working
   directory to that directory and install SCons by executing the
   following commands:
      # cd scons-0.98.2
      # python setup.py install

   This will build SCons, install the scons script in the default system
   scripts directory (/usr/local/bin or C:\Python2.2\Scripts), and will
   install the SCons build engine in an appropriate stand-alone library
   directory (/usr/local/lib/scons or C:\Python2.2\scons). Because these
   are system directories, you may need root (on Linux or UNIX) or
   Administrator (on Windows) privileges to install SCons like this.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.3.1. Building and Installing Multiple Versions of SCons Side-by-Side

   The SCons setup.py script has some extensions that support easy
   installation of multiple versions of SCons in side-by-side locations.
   This makes it easier to download and experiment with different versions
   of SCons before moving your official build process to a new version,
   for example.

   To install SCons in a version-specific location, add the --version-lib
   option when you call setup.py:
        # python setup.py install --version-lib

   This will install the SCons build engine in the /usr/lib/scons-0.98.2
   or C:\Python2.2\scons-0.98.2 directory, for example.

   If you use the --version-lib option the first time you install SCons,
   you do not need to specify it each time you install a new version. The
   SCons setup.py script will detect the version-specific directory
   name(s) and assume you want to install all versions in version-specific
   directories. You can override that assumption in the future by
   explicitly specifying the --standalone-lib option.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.3.2. Installing SCons in Other Locations

   You can install SCons in locations other than the default by specifying
   the --prefix= option:
        # python setup.py install --prefix=/opt/scons

   This would install the scons script in /opt/scons/bin and the build
   engine in /opt/scons/lib/scons,

   Note that you can specify both the --prefix= and the --version-lib
   options at the same type, in which case setup.py will install the build
   engine in a version-specific directory relative to the specified
   prefix. Adding --version-lib to the above example would install the
   build engine in /opt/scons/lib/scons-0.98.2.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.3.3. Building and Installing SCons Without Administrative Privileges

   If you don't have the right privileges to install SCons in a system
   location, simply use the --prefix= option to install it in a location
   of your choosing. For example, to install SCons in appropriate
   locations relative to the user's $HOME directory, the scons script in
   $HOME/bin and the build engine in $HOME/lib/scons, simply type:
        $ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

   You may, of course, specify any other location you prefer, and may use
   the --version-lib option if you would like to install version-specific
   directories relative to the specified prefix.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Simple Builds

   In this chapter, you will see several examples of very simple build
   configurations using SCons, which will demonstrate how easy it is to
   use SCons to build programs from several different programming
   languages on different types of systems.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.1. Building Simple C / C++ Programs

   Here's the famous "Hello, World!" program in C:
      int
      main()
      {
          printf("Hello, world!\n");
      }

   And here's how to build it using SCons. Enter the following into a file
   named SConstruct:
      Program('hello.c')

   This minimal configuration file gives SCons two pieces of information:
   what you want to build (an executable program), and the input file from
   which you want it built (the hello.c file). [189]Program is a
   builder_method, a Python call that tells SCons that you want to build
   an executable program.

   That's it. Now run the scons command to build the program. On a
   POSIX-compliant system like Linux or UNIX, you'll see something like:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      scons: done building targets.

   On a Windows system with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, you'll see
   something like:
      C:\>scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cl /nologo /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
      link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
      scons: done building targets.

   First, notice that you only need to specify the name of the source
   file, and that SCons correctly deduces the names of the object and
   executable files to be built from the base of the source file name.

   Second, notice that the same input SConstruct file, without any
   changes, generates the correct output file names on both systems:
   hello.o and hello on POSIX systems, hello.obj and hello.exe on Windows
   systems. This is a simple example of how SCons makes it extremely easy
   to write portable software builds.

   (Note that we won't provide duplicate side-by-side POSIX and Windows
   output for all of the examples in this guide; just keep in mind that,
   unless otherwise specified, any of the examples should work equally
   well on both types of systems.)
     __________________________________________________________________

2.2. Building Object Files

   The [190]Program builder method is only one of many builder methods
   that SCons provides to build different types of files. Another is the
   [191]Object builder method, which tells SCons to build an object file
   from the specified source file:
      Object('hello.c')

   Now when you run the scons command to build the program, it will build
   just the hello.o object file on a POSIX system:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      scons: done building targets.

   And just the hello.obj object file on a Windows system (with the
   Microsoft Visual C++ compiler):
      C:\>scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cl /nologo /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
      scons: done building targets.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.3. Simple Java Builds

   SCons also makes building with Java extremely easy. Unlike the
   [192]Program and [193]Object builder methods, however, the [194]Java
   builder method requires that you specify the name of a destination
   directory in which you want the class files placed, followed by the
   source directory in which the .java files live:
     Java('classes', 'src')

   If the src directory contains a single hello.java file, then the output
   from running the scons command would look something like this (on a
   POSIX system):
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/hello.java
      scons: done building targets.

   We'll cover Java builds in more detail, including building Java archive
   (.jar) and other types of file, in [195]Chapter 25.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.4. Cleaning Up After a Build

   When using SCons, it is unnecessary to add special commands or target
   names to clean up after a build. Instead, you simply use the -c or
   --clean option when you invoke SCons, and SCons removes the appropriate
   built files. So if we build our example above and then invoke scons -c
   afterwards, the output on POSIX looks like:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      scons: done building targets.
      % scons -c
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Cleaning targets ...
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      scons: done cleaning targets.

   And the output on Windows looks like:
      C:\>scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cl /nologo /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
      link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
      scons: done building targets.
      C:\>scons -c
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Cleaning targets ...
      Removed hello.obj
      Removed hello.exe
      scons: done cleaning targets.

   Notice that SCons changes its output to tell you that it is Cleaning
   targets ... and done cleaning targets.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5. The SConstruct File

   If you're used to build systems like Make you've already figured out
   that the SConstruct file is the SCons equivalent of a Makefile. That
   is, the SConstruct file is the input file that SCons reads to control
   the build.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.1. SConstruct Files Are Python Scripts

   There is, however, an important difference between an SConstruct file
   and a Makefile: the SConstruct file is actually a Python script. If
   you're not already familiar with Python, don't worry. This User's Guide
   will introduce you step-by-step to the relatively small amount of
   Python you'll need to know to be able to use SCons effectively. And
   Python is very easy to learn.

   One aspect of using Python as the scripting language is that you can
   put comments in your SConstruct file using Python's commenting
   convention; that is, everything between a '#' and the end of the line
   will be ignored:
        # Arrange to build the "hello" program.
        Program('hello.c')    # "hello.c" is the source file.

   You'll see throughout the remainder of this Guide that being able to
   use the power of a real scripting language can greatly simplify the
   solutions to complex requirements of real-world builds.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.2. SCons Functions Are Order-Independent

   One important way in which the SConstruct file is not exactly like a
   normal Python script, and is more like a Makefile, is that the order in
   which the SCons functions are called in the SConstruct file does not
   affect the order in which SCons actually builds the programs and object
   files you want it to build.[196][1] In other words, when you call the
   [197]Program builder (or any other builder method), you're not telling
   SCons to build the program at the instant the builder method is called.
   Instead, you're telling SCons to build the program that you want, for
   example, a program built from a file named hello.c, and it's up to
   SCons to build that program (and any other files) whenever it's
   necessary. (We'll learn more about how SCons decides when building or
   rebuilding a file is necessary in [198]Chapter 6, below.)

   SCons reflects this distinction between calling a builder method like
   Program> and actually building the program by printing the status
   messages that indicate when it's "just reading" the SConstruct file,
   and when it's actually building the target files. This is to make it
   clear when SCons is executing the Python statements that make up the
   SConstruct file, and when SCons is actually executing the commands or
   other actions to build the necessary files.

   Let's clarify this with an example. Python has a print statement that
   prints a string of characters to the screen. If we put print statements
   around our calls to the Program builder method:
       print "Calling Program('hello.c')"
       Program('hello.c')
       print "Calling Program('goodbye.c')"
       Program('goodbye.c')
       print "Finished calling Program()"

   Then when we execute SCons, we see the output from the print statements
   in between the messages about reading the SConscript files, indicating
   that that is when the Python statements are being executed:
       % scons
       scons: Reading SConscript files ...
       Calling Program('hello.c')
       Calling Program('goodbye.c')
       Finished calling Program()
       scons: done reading SConscript files.
       scons: Building targets ...
       cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
       cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       scons: done building targets.

   Notice also that SCons built the goodbye program first, even though the
   "reading SConscript" output shows that we called Program('hello.c')
   first in the SConstruct file.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.6. Making the SCons Output Less Verbose

   You've already seen how SCons prints some messages about what it's
   doing, surrounding the actual commands used to build the software:
      C:\>scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cl /nologo /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
      link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
      scons: done building targets.

   These messages emphasize the order in which SCons does its work: all of
   the configuration files (generically referred to as SConscript files)
   are read and executed first, and only then are the target files built.
   Among other benefits, these messages help to distinguish between errors
   that occur while the configuration files are read, and errors that
   occur while targets are being built.

   One drawback, of course, is that these messages clutter the output.
   Fortunately, they're easily disabled by using the -Q option when
   invoking SCons:
      C:\>scons -Q
      cl /nologo /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
      link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj

   Because we want this User's Guide to focus on what SCons is actually
   doing, we're going to use the -Q option to remove these messages from
   the output of all the remaining examples in this Guide.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Less Simple Things to Do With Builds

   In this chapter, you will see several examples of very simple build
   configurations using SCons, which will demonstrate how easy it is to
   use SCons to build programs from several different programming
   languages on different types of systems.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.1. Specifying the Name of the Target (Output) File

   You've seen that when you call the [199]Program builder method, it
   builds the resulting program with the same base name as the source
   file. That is, the following call to build an executable program from
   the hello.c source file will build an executable program named hello on
   POSIX systems, and an executable program named hello.exe on Windows
   systems:
       Program('hello.c')

   If you want to build a program with a different name than the base of
   the source file name, you simply put the target file name to the left
   of the source file name:
       Program('new_hello', 'hello.c')

   (SCons requires the target file name first, followed by the source file
   name, so that the order mimics that of an assignment statement in most
   programming languages, including Python: "program = source files".)

   Now SCons will build an executable program named new_hello when run on
   a POSIX system:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o new_hello hello.o

   And SCons will build an executable program named new_hello.exe when run
   on a Windows system:
       C:\>scons -Q
       cl /nologo /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
       link /nologo /OUT:new_hello.exe hello.obj
     __________________________________________________________________

3.2. Compiling Multiple Source Files

   You've just seen how to configure SCons to compile a program from a
   single source file. It's more common, of course, that you'll need to
   build a program from many input source files, not just one. To do this,
   you need to put the source files in a Python list (enclosed in square
   brackets), like so:
       Program(['prog.c', 'file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   A build of the above example would look like:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
       cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
       cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
       cc -o prog prog.o file1.o file2.o

   Notice that SCons deduces the output program name from the first source
   file specified in the list--that is, because the first source file was
   prog.c, SCons will name the resulting program prog (or prog.exe on a
   Windows system). If you want to specify a different program name, then
   (as we've seen in the previous section) you slide the list of source
   files over to the right to make room for the output program file name.
   (SCons puts the output file name to the left of the source file names
   so that the order mimics that of an assignment statement: "program =
   source files".) This makes our example:
       Program('program', ['prog.c', 'file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   On Linux, a build of this example would look like:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
       cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
       cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
       cc -o program prog.o file1.o file2.o

   Or on Windows:
       C:\>scons -Q
       cl /nologo /c file1.c /Fofile1.obj
       cl /nologo /c file2.c /Fofile2.obj
       cl /nologo /c prog.c /Foprog.obj
       link /nologo /OUT:program.exe prog.obj file1.obj file2.obj
     __________________________________________________________________

3.3. Making a list of files with Glob()

   You can also use the Glob() function to find all files matching a
   certain template, using standard the shell pattern matching characters
   *, ?, and [abc] to match any of a, b, or c. [!abc] is also supported,
   to match any character except a, b, or c. This makes many
   multi-source-file builds quite easy:
       Program('program', Glob('*.c'))

   The SCons man page has more details on using Glob() with Variant dirs
   and Repositories and returning strings rather than Nodes.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.4. Specifying Single Files Vs. Lists of Files

   We've now shown you two ways to specify the source for a program, one
   with a list of files:
       Program('hello', ['file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   And one with a single file:
       Program('hello', 'hello.c')

   You could actually put a single file name in a list, too, which you
   might prefer just for the sake of consistency:
       Program('hello', ['hello.c'])

   SCons functions will accept a single file name in either form. In fact,
   internally, SCons treats all input as lists of files, but allows you to
   omit the square brackets to cut down a little on the typing when
   there's only a single file name.

Important

             Although SCons functions are forgiving about whether or not you use a
             string vs. a list for a single file name, Python itself is more strict
             about treating lists and strings differently. So where SCons allows
             either a string or list:
                 # The following two calls both work correctly:
                 Program('program1', 'program1.c')
                 Program('program2', ['program2.c'])

             Trying to do "Python things" that mix strings and lists will cause
             errors or lead to incorrect results:
                 common_sources = ['file1.c', 'file2.c']

                 # THE FOLLOWING IS INCORRECT AND GENERATES A PYTHON ERROR
                 # BECAUSE IT TRIES TO ADD A STRING TO A LIST:
                 Program('program1', common_sources + 'program1.c')

                 # The following works correctly, because it's adding two
                 # lists together to make another list.
                 Program('program2', common_sources + ['program2.c'])
     __________________________________________________________________

3.5. Making Lists of Files Easier to Read

   One drawback to the use of a Python list for source files is that each
   file name must be enclosed in quotes (either single quotes or double
   quotes). This can get cumbersome and difficult to read when the list of
   file names is long. Fortunately, SCons and Python provide a number of
   ways to make sure that the SConstruct file stays easy to read.

   To make long lists of file names easier to deal with, SCons provides a
   Split function that takes a quoted list of file names, with the names
   separated by spaces or other white-space characters, and turns it into
   a list of separate file names. Using the Split function turns the
   previous example into:
       Program('program', Split('main.c file1.c file2.c'))

   (If you're already familiar with Python, you'll have realized that this
   is similar to the split() method in the Python standard string module.
   Unlike the string.split() method, however, the Split function does not
   require a string as input and will wrap up a single non-string object
   in a list, or return its argument untouched if it's already a list.
   This comes in handy as a way to make sure arbitrary values can be
   passed to SCons functions without having to check the type of the
   variable by hand.)

   Putting the call to the Split function inside the Program call can also
   be a little unwieldy. A more readable alternative is to assign the
   output from the Split call to a variable name, and then use the
   variable when calling the Program function:
       list = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
       Program('program', list)

   Lastly, the Split function doesn't care how much white space separates
   the file names in the quoted string. This allows you to create lists of
   file names that span multiple lines, which often makes for easier
   editing:
       list = Split("""main.c
                       file1.c
                       file2.c""")
       Program('program', list)

   (Note in this example that we used the Python "triple-quote" syntax,
   which allows a string to contain multiple lines. The three quotes can
   be either single or double quotes.)
     __________________________________________________________________

3.6. Keyword Arguments

   SCons also allows you to identify the output file and input source
   files using Python keyword arguments. The output file is known as the
   target, and the source file(s) are known (logically enough) as the
   source. The Python syntax for this is:
       list = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
       Program(target = 'program', source = list)

   Because the keywords explicitly identify what each argument is, you can
   actually reverse the order if you prefer:
       list = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
       Program(source = list, target = 'program')

   Whether or not you choose to use keyword arguments to identify the
   target and source files, and the order in which you specify them when
   using keywords, are purely personal choices; SCons functions the same
   regardless.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7. Compiling Multiple Programs

   In order to compile multiple programs within the same SConstruct file,
   simply call the Program method multiple times, once for each program
   you need to build:
       Program('foo.c')
       Program('bar', ['bar1.c', 'bar2.c'])

   SCons would then build the programs as follows:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o bar1.o -c bar1.c
       cc -o bar2.o -c bar2.c
       cc -o bar bar1.o bar2.o
       cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
       cc -o foo foo.o

   Notice that SCons does not necessarily build the programs in the same
   order in which you specify them in the SConstruct file. SCons does,
   however, recognize that the individual object files must be built
   before the resulting program can be built. We'll discuss this in
   greater detail in the "Dependencies" section, below.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.8. Sharing Source Files Between Multiple Programs

   It's common to re-use code by sharing source files between multiple
   programs. One way to do this is to create a library from the common
   source files, which can then be linked into resulting programs.
   (Creating libraries is discussed in [200]Chapter 4, below.)

   A more straightforward, but perhaps less convenient, way to share
   source files between multiple programs is simply to include the common
   files in the lists of source files for each program:
       Program(Split('foo.c common1.c common2.c'))
       Program('bar', Split('bar1.c bar2.c common1.c common2.c'))

   SCons recognizes that the object files for the common1.c and common2.c
   source files each only need to be built once, even though the resulting
   object files are each linked in to both of the resulting executable
   programs:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o bar1.o -c bar1.c
       cc -o bar2.o -c bar2.c
       cc -o common1.o -c common1.c
       cc -o common2.o -c common2.c
       cc -o bar bar1.o bar2.o common1.o common2.o
       cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
       cc -o foo foo.o common1.o common2.o

   If two or more programs share a lot of common source files, repeating
   the common files in the list for each program can be a maintenance
   problem when you need to change the list of common files. You can
   simplify this by creating a separate Python list to hold the common
   file names, and concatenating it with other lists using the Python +
   operator:
       common = ['common1.c', 'common2.c']
       foo_files = ['foo.c'] + common
       bar_files = ['bar1.c', 'bar2.c'] + common
       Program('foo', foo_files)
       Program('bar', bar_files)

   This is functionally equivalent to the previous example.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Building and Linking with Libraries

   It's often useful to organize large software projects by collecting
   parts of the software into one or more libraries. SCons makes it easy
   to create libraries and to use them in the programs.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.1. Building Libraries

   You build your own libraries by specifying [201]Library instead of
   [202]Program:
      Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   SCons uses the appropriate library prefix and suffix for your system.
   So on POSIX or Linux systems, the above example would build as follows
   (although ranlib may not be called on all systems):
      % scons -Q
      cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
      ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
      ranlib libfoo.a

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:
      C:\>scons -Q
      cl /nologo /c f1.c /Fof1.obj
      cl /nologo /c f2.c /Fof2.obj
      cl /nologo /c f3.c /Fof3.obj
      lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj

   The rules for the target name of the library are similar to those for
   programs: if you don't explicitly specify a target library name, SCons
   will deduce one from the name of the first source file specified, and
   SCons will add an appropriate file prefix and suffix if you leave them
   off.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.1.1. Building Libraries From Source Code or Object Files

   The previous example shows building a library from a list of source
   files. You can, however, also give the [203]Library call object files,
   and it will correctly realize In fact, you can arbitrarily mix source
   code files and object files in the source list:
        Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.o', 'f3.c', 'f4.o'])

   And SCons realizes that only the source code files must be compiled
   into object files before creating the final library:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
        cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
        ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o
        ranlib libfoo.a

   Of course, in this example, the object files must already exist for the
   build to succeed. See [204]Chapter 5, below, for information about how
   you can build object files explicitly and include the built files in a
   library.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.1.2. Building Static Libraries Explicitly: the StaticLibrary Builder

   The [205]Library function builds a traditional static library. If you
   want to be explicit about the type of library being built, you can use
   the synonym [206]StaticLibrary function instead of Library:
        StaticLibrary('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   There is no functional difference between the [207]StaticLibrary and
   Library functions.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.1.3. Building Shared (DLL) Libraries: the SharedLibrary Builder

   If you want to build a shared library (on POSIX systems) or a DLL file
   (on Windows systems), you use the [208]SharedLibrary function:
        SharedLibrary('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   The output on POSIX:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o f1.os -c f1.c
        cc -o f2.os -c f2.c
        cc -o f3.os -c f3.c
        cc -o libfoo.so -shared f1.os f2.os f3.os

   And the output on Windows:
        C:\>scons -Q
        cl /nologo /c f1.c /Fof1.obj
        cl /nologo /c f2.c /Fof2.obj
        cl /nologo /c f3.c /Fof3.obj
        link /nologo /dll /out:foo.dll /implib:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
        RegServerFunc(target, source, env)

   Notice again that SCons takes care of building the output file
   correctly, adding the -shared option for a POSIX compilation, and the
   /dll option on Windows.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.2. Linking with Libraries

   Usually, you build a library because you want to link it with one or
   more programs. You link libraries with a program by specifying the
   libraries in the [209]$LIBS construction variable, and by specifying
   the directory in which the library will be found in the [210]$LIBPATH
   construction variable:
      Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
      Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo', 'bar'], LIBPATH='.')

   Notice, of course, that you don't need to specify a library prefix
   (like lib) or suffix (like .a or .lib). SCons uses the correct prefix
   or suffix for the current system.

   On a POSIX or Linux system, a build of the above example would look
   like:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
      ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
      ranlib libfoo.a
      cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
      cc -o prog prog.o -L. -lfoo -lbar

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:
      C:\>scons -Q
      cl /nologo /c f1.c /Fof1.obj
      cl /nologo /c f2.c /Fof2.obj
      cl /nologo /c f3.c /Fof3.obj
      lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
      cl /nologo /c prog.c /Foprog.obj
      link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:. foo.lib bar.lib prog.obj

   As usual, notice that SCons has taken care of constructing the correct
   command lines to link with the specified library on each system.

   Note also that, if you only have a single library to link with, you can
   specify the library name in single string, instead of a Python list, so
   that:
      Program('prog.c', LIBS='foo', LIBPATH='.')

   is equivalent to:
      Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo'], LIBPATH='.')

   This is similar to the way that SCons handles either a string or a list
   to specify a single source file.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.3. Finding Libraries: the $LIBPATH Construction Variable

   By default, the linker will only look in certain system-defined
   directories for libraries. SCons knows how to look for libraries in
   directories that you specify with the [211]$LIBPATH construction
   variable. $LIBPATH consists of a list of directory names, like so:
      Program('prog.c', LIBS = 'm',
                        LIBPATH = ['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])

   Using a Python list is preferred because it's portable across systems.
   Alternatively, you could put all of the directory names in a single
   string, separated by the system-specific path separator character: a
   colon on POSIX systems:
      LIBPATH = '/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib'

   or a semi-colon on Windows systems:
      LIBPATH = 'C:\\lib;D:\\lib'

   (Note that Python requires that the backslash separators in a Windows
   path name be escaped within strings.)

   When the linker is executed, SCons will create appropriate flags so
   that the linker will look for libraries in the same directories as
   SCons. So on a POSIX or Linux system, a build of the above example
   would look like:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
      cc -o prog prog.o -L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lm

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:
      C:\>scons -Q
      cl /nologo /c prog.c /Foprog.obj
      link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:\usr\lib /LIBPATH:\usr\local\lib m.lib
 prog.obj

   Note again that SCons has taken care of the system-specific details of
   creating the right command-line options.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 5. Node Objects

   Internally, SCons represents all of the files and directories it knows
   about as Nodes. These internal objects (not object files) can be used
   in a variety of ways to make your SConscript files portable and easy to
   read.
     __________________________________________________________________

5.1. Builder Methods Return Lists of Target Nodes

   All builder methods return a list of Node objects that identify the
   target file or files that will be built. These returned Nodes can be
   passed as source files to other builder methods,

   For example, suppose that we want to build the two object files that
   make up a program with different options. This would mean calling the
   [212]Object builder once for each object file, specifying the desired
   options:
    Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
    Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')

   One way to combine these object files into the resulting program would
   be to call the [213]Program builder with the names of the object files
   listed as sources:
    Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
    Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')
    Program(['hello.o', 'goodbye.o'])

   The problem with listing the names as strings is that our SConstruct
   file is no longer portable across operating systems. It won't, for
   example, work on Windows because the object files there would be named
   hello.obj and goodbye.obj, not hello.o and goodbye.o.

   A better solution is to assign the lists of targets returned by the
   calls to the Object builder to variables, which we can then concatenate
   in our call to the Program builder:
      hello_list = Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
      goodbye_list = Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')
      Program(hello_list + goodbye_list)

   This makes our SConstruct file portable again, the build output on
   Linux looking like:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o goodbye.o -c -DGOODBYE goodbye.c
       cc -o hello.o -c -DHELLO hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o goodbye.o

   And on Windows:
       C:\>scons -Q
       cl -DGOODBYE /c goodbye.c /Fogoodbye.obj
       cl -DHELLO /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
       link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj goodbye.obj

   We'll see examples of using the list of nodes returned by builder
   methods throughout the rest of this guide.
     __________________________________________________________________

5.2. Explicitly Creating File and Directory Nodes

   It's worth mentioning here that SCons maintains a clear distinction
   between Nodes that represent files and Nodes that represent
   directories. SCons supports File and Dir functions that, repectively,
   return a file or directory Node:
      hello_c = File('hello.c')
      Program(hello_c)

      classes = Dir('classes')
      Java(classes, 'src')

   Normally, you don't need to call File or Dir directly, because calling
   a builder method automatically treats strings as the names of files or
   directories, and translates them into the Node objects for you. The
   File and Dir functions can come in handy in situations where you need
   to explicitly instruct SCons about the type of Node being passed to a
   builder or other function, or unambiguously refer to a specific file in
   a directory tree.

   There are also times when you may need to refer to an entry in a file
   system without knowing in advance whether it's a file or a directory.
   For those situations, SCons also supports an Entry function, which
   returns a Node that can represent either a file or a directory.
    xyzzy = Entry('xyzzy')

   The returned xyzzy Node will be turned into a file or directory Node
   the first time it is used by a builder method or other function that
   requires one vs. the other.
     __________________________________________________________________

5.3. Printing Node File Names

   One of the most common things you can do with a Node is use it to print
   the file name that the node represents. For example, the following
   SConstruct file:
      hello_c = File('hello.c')
      Program(hello_c)

      classes = Dir('classes')
      Java(classes, 'src')

      object_list = Object('hello.c')
      program_list = Program(object_list)
      print "The object file is:", object_list[0]
      print "The program file is:", program_list[0]

   Would print the following file names on a POSIX system:
      % scons -Q
      The object file is: hello.o
      The program file is: hello
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   And the following file names on a Windows system:
      C:\>scons -Q
      The object file is: hello.obj
      The program file is: hello.exe
      cl /nologo /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
      link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
     __________________________________________________________________

5.4. Using a Node's File Name as a String

   Printing a Node's name as described in the previous section works
   because the string representation of a Node is the name of the file. If
   you want to do something other than print the name of the file, you can
   fetch it by using the builtin Python str function. For example, if you
   want to use the Python os.path.exists to figure out whether a file
   exists while the SConstruct file is being read and executed, you can
   fetch the string as follows:
      import os.path
      program_list = Program('hello.c')
      program_name = str(program_list[0])
      if not os.path.exists(program_name):
          print program_name, "does not exist!"

   Which executes as follows on a POSIX system:
      % scons -Q
      hello does not exist!
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Dependencies

   So far we've seen how SCons handles one-time builds. But one of the
   main functions of a build tool like SCons is to rebuild only the
   necessary things when source files change--or, put another way, SCons
   should not waste time rebuilding things that have already been built.
   You can see this at work simply by re-invoking SCons after building our
   simple hello example:
     % scons -Q
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     % scons -Q
     scons: `.' is up to date.

   The second time it is executed, SCons realizes that the hello program
   is up-to-date with respect to the current hello.c source file, and
   avoids rebuilding it. You can see this more clearly by naming the hello
   program explicitly on the command line:
     % scons -Q hello
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     % scons -Q hello
     scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Note that SCons reports "...is up to date" only for target files named
   explicitly on the command line, to avoid cluttering the output.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1. Deciding When an Input File Has Changed: the Decider Function

   Another aspect of avoiding unnecessary rebuilds is the fundamental
   build tool behavior of rebuilding things when an input file changes, so
   that the built software is up to date. By default, SCons keeps track of
   this through an MD5 signature, or checksum, of the contents of each
   file, although you can easily configure SCons to use the modification
   times (or time stamps) instead. You can even specify your own Python
   function for deciding if an input file has changed.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.1. Using MD5 Signatures to Decide if a File Has Changed

   By default, SCons keeps track of whether a file has changed based on an
   MD5 checksum of the file's contents, not the file's modification time.
   This means that you may be surprised by the default SCons behavior if
   you are used to the Make convention of forcing a rebuild by updating
   the file's modification time (using the touch command, for example):
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % touch hello.c
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Even though the file's modification time has changed, SCons realizes
   that the contents of the hello.c file have not changed, and therefore
   that the hello program need not be rebuilt. This avoids unnecessary
   rebuilds when, for example, someone rewrites the contents of a file
   without making a change. But if the contents of the file really do
   change, then SCons detects the change and rebuilds the program as
   required:
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % edit hello.c
             [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o

   Note that you can, if you wish, specify this default behavior (MD5
   signatures) explicitly using the Decider function as follows:
        Program('hello.c')
        Decider('MD5')

   You can also use the string 'content' as a synonym for 'MD5' when
   calling the Decider function.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.1.1. Ramifications of Using MD5 Signatures

   Using MD5 Signatures to decide if an input file has changed has one
   surprising benefit: if a source file has been changed in such a way
   that the contents of the rebuilt target file(s) will be exactly the
   same as the last time the file was built, then any "downstream" target
   files that depend on the rebuilt-but-not-changed target file actually
   need not be rebuilt.

   So if, for example, a user were to only change a comment in a hello.c
   file, then the rebuilt hello.o file would be exactly the same as the
   one previously built (assuming the compiler doesn't put any
   build-specific information in the object file). SCons would then
   realize that it would not need to rebuild the hello program as follows:
           % scons -Q hello
           cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
           cc -o hello hello.o
           % edit hello.c
             [CHANGE A COMMENT IN hello.c]
           % scons -Q hello
           cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
           scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In essence, SCons "short-circuits" any dependent builds when it
   realizes that a target file has been rebuilt to exactly the same file
   as the last build. This does take some extra processing time to read
   the contents of the target (hello.o) file, but often saves time when
   the rebuild that was avoided would have been time-consuming and
   expensive.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.2. Using Time Stamps to Decide If a File Has Changed

   If you prefer, you can configure SCons to use the modification time of
   a file, not the file contents, when deciding if a target needs to be
   rebuilt. SCons gives you two ways to use time stamps to decide if an
   input file has changed since the last time a target has been built.

   The most familiar way to use time stamps is the way Make does: that is,
   have SCons decide and target must be rebuilt if if a source file's
   modification time is newer than the target file. To do this, call the
   Decider function as follows:
        Program('hello.c')
        Decider('timestamp-newer')

   This makes SCons act like Make when a file's modification time is
   updated (using the touch command, for example):
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % touch hello.c
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o

   And, in fact, because this behavior is the same as the behavior of
   Make, you can also use the string 'make' as a synonym for
   'timestamp-newer' when calling the Decider function:
        Program('hello.c')
        Decider('make')

   One drawback to using times stamps exactly like Make is that if an
   input file's modification time suddenly becomes older than a target
   file, the target file will not be rebuilt. This can happen if an old
   copy of a source file is restored from a backup archive, for example.
   The contents of the restored file will likely be different than they
   were the last time a dependent target was built, but the target won't
   be rebuilt because the modification time of the source file is not
   newer than the target.

   Because SCons actually stores information about the source files' time
   stamps whenever a target is built, it can handle this situation by
   checking for an exact match of the source file time stamp, instead of
   just whether or not the source file is newer than the target file. To
   do this, specify the argument 'timestamp-match' when calling the
   Decider function:
        Program('hello.c')
        Decider('timestamp-match')

   When configured this way, SCons will rebuild a target whenever a source
   file's modification time has changed. So if we use the touch -t option
   to change the modification time of hello.c to an old date (January 1,
   1989), SCons will still rebuild the target file:
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % touch -t 198901010000 hello.c
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In general, the only reason to prefer timestamp-newer instead of
   timestamp-match, would be if you have some specific reason to require
   this Make-like behavior of not rebuilding a target when an
   otherwise-modified source file is older.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.3. Deciding If a File Has Changed Using Both MD Signatures and Time
Stamps

   As a performance enhancement, SCons provides a way to use MD5 checksums
   of file contents but to only read the contents whenever the file's
   timestamp has changed. To do this, call the Decider function with
   'MD5-timestamp' argument as follows:
        Program('hello.c')
        Decider('MD5-timestamp')

   So configured, SCons will still behave like it does when using
   Decider('MD5'):
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % touch hello.c
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.
         % edit hello.c
             [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.

   However, the second call to SCons in the above output, when the build
   is up-to-date, will have been performed by simply looking at the
   modification time of the hello.c file, not by opening it and performing
   an MD5 checksum calcuation on its contents. This can significantly
   speed up many up-to-date builds.

   The only drawback to using Decider('MD5-timestamp') is that SCons will
   not rebuild a target file if a source file was modified within one
   second of the last time SCons built the file. While most developers are
   programming, this isn't a problem in practice, since it's unlikely that
   someone will have built and then thought quickly enought to make a
   substantive change to a source file within one second. Certain build
   scripts or continuous integration tools may, however, rely on the
   ability to applying changes to files automatically and then rebuild as
   quickly as possible, in which case use of Decider('MD5-timestamp') may
   not be appropriate.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.4. Writing Your Own Custom Decider Function

   The different string values that we've passed to the Decider function
   are essentially used by SCons to pick one of several specific internal
   functions that implement various ways of deciding if a dependency
   (usually a source file) has changed since a target file has been built.
   As it turns out, you can also supply your own function to decide if a
   dependency has changed.

   For example, suppose we have an input file that contains a lot of data,
   in some specific regular format, that is used to rebuild a lot of
   different target files, but each target file really only depends on one
   particular section of the input file. We'd like to have each target
   file depend on only its section of the input file. However, since the
   input file may contain a lot of data, we only want to open the input
   file if its timestamp has changed. This could done with a custom
   Decider function that might look something like this:
        Program('hello.c')
        def decide_if_changed(dependency, target, prev_ni):
            if self.get_timestamp() != prev_ni.timestamp:
                dep = str(dependency)
                tgt = str(target)
                if specific_part_of_file_has_changed(dep, tgt):
                    return True
            return False
        Decider(decide_if_changed)

   Note that in the function definition, the dependency (input file) is
   the first argument, and then the target. Both of these are passed to
   the functions as SCons Node objects, which we convert to strings using
   the Python str(). The third argument, prev_ni, is an object that holds
   the signature or timestamp information that was recorded about the
   dependency the last time the target was built.

   Note that ignoring some of the arguments in your custom Decider
   function is a perfectly normal thing to do, if they don't impact the
   way you want to decide if the dependency file has changed.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.5. Mixing Different Ways of Deciding If a File Has Changed

   The previous examples have all demonstrated calling the global Decider
   function to configure all dependency decisions that SCons makes.
   Sometimes, however, you want to be able to configure different
   decision-making for different targets. When that's necessary, you can
   use the env.Decider method to affect only the configuration decisions
   for targets built with a specific construction environment.

   For example, if we arbitrarily want to build one program using MD5
   checkums and another use file modification times from the same source
   we might configure it this way:
        env1 = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
        env2 = env1.Clone()
        env2.Decider('timestamp-match')
        env1.Program('prog-MD5', 'program1.c')
        env2.Program('prog-timestamp', 'program2.c')

   If both of the programs include the same inc.h file, then updating the
   modification time of inc.h (using the touch command) will cause only
   prog-timestamp to be rebuilt:
         % scons -Q
         cc -o program1.o -c -I. program1.c
         cc -o prog-MD5 program1.o
         cc -o program2.o -c -I. program2.c
         cc -o prog-timestamp program2.o
         % touch inc.h
         % scons -Q
         cc -o program2.o -c -I. program2.c
         cc -o prog-timestamp program2.o
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2. Older Functions for Deciding When an Input File Has Changed

   SCons still supports two functions that used to be the primary methods
   for configuring the decision about whether or not an input file has
   changed. Although they're not officially deprecated yet, their use is
   discouraged, mainly because they rely on a somewhat confusing
   distinction between how source files and target files are handled.
   These functions are documented here mainly in case you encounter them
   in existing SConscript files.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2.1. The SourceSignatures Function

   The SourceSignatures function is fairly straightforward, and supports
   two different argument values to configure whether source file changes
   should be decided using MD5 signatures:
        Program('hello.c')
        SourceSignatures('MD5')

   Or using time stamps:
        Program('hello.c')
        SourceSignatures('timestamp')

   These are roughly equivalent to specifying Decider('MD5') or
   Decider('timestamp-match'), respectively, although it only affects how
   SCons makes decisions about dependencies on source files--that is,
   files that are not built from any other files.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2.2. The TargetSignatures Function

   The TargetSignatures function specifies how SCons decides when a target
   file has changed when it is used as a dependency of (input to) another
   target--that is, the TargetSignatures function configures how the
   signatures of "intermediate" target files are used when deciding if a
   "downstream" target file must be rebuilt. [214][2]

   The TargetSignatures function supports the same 'MD5' and 'timestamp'
   argument values that are supported by the SourceSignatures, with the
   same meanings, but applied to target files. That is, in the example:
        Program('hello.c')
        TargetSignatures('MD5')

   The MD5 checksum of the hello.o target file will be used to decide if
   it has changed since the last time the "downstream" hello target file
   was built. And in the example:
        Program('hello.c')
        TargetSignatures('timestamp')

   The modification time of the hello.o target file will be used to decide
   if it has changed since the last time the "downstream" hello target
   file was built.

   The TargetSignatures function supports two additional argument values:
   'source' and 'build'. The 'source' argument specifies that decisions
   involving whether target files have changed since a previous build
   should use the same behavior for the decisions configured for source
   files (using the SourceSignatures function). So in the example:
        Program('hello.c')
        TargetSignatures('source')
        SourceSignatures('timestamp')

   All files, both targets and sources, will use modification times when
   deciding if an input file has changed since the last time a target was
   built.

   Lastly, the 'build' argument specifies that SCons should examine the
   build status of a target file and always rebuild a "downstream" target
   if the target file was itself rebuilt, without re-examining the
   contents or timestamp of the newly-built target file. If the target
   file was not rebuilt during this scons invocation, then the target file
   will be examined the same way as configured by the SourceSignature call
   to decide if it has changed.

   This mimics the behavior of build signatures in earlier versions of
   SCons. A build signature re-combined signatures of all the input files
   that went into making the target file, so that the target file itself
   did not need to have its contents read to compute an MD5 signature.
   This can improve performance for some configurations, but is generally
   not as effective as using Decider('MD5-timestamp').
     __________________________________________________________________

6.3. Implicit Dependencies: The $CPPPATH Construction Variable

   Now suppose that our "Hello, World!" program actually has an #include
   line to include the hello.h file in the compilation:
       #include <hello.h>
       int
       main()
       {
           printf("Hello, %s!\n", string);
       }

   And, for completeness, the hello.h file looks like this:
       #define string    "world"

   In this case, we want SCons to recognize that, if the contents of the
   hello.h file change, the hello program must be recompiled. To do this,
   we need to modify the SConstruct file like so:
       Program('hello.c', CPPPATH = '.')

   The [215]$CPPPATH value tells SCons to look in the current directory
   ('.') for any files included by C source files (.c or .h files). With
   this assignment in the SConstruct file:
       % scons -Q hello
       cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       % scons -Q hello
       scons: `hello' is up to date.
       % edit hello.h
           [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
       % scons -Q hello
       cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o

   First, notice that SCons added the -I. argument from the $CPPPATH
   variable so that the compilation would find the hello.h file in the
   local directory.

   Second, realize that SCons knows that the hello program must be rebuilt
   because it scans the contents of the hello.c file for the #include
   lines that indicate another file is being included in the compilation.
   SCons records these as implicit dependencies of the target file,
   Consequently, when the hello.h file changes, SCons realizes that the
   hello.c file includes it, and rebuilds the resulting hello program that
   depends on both the hello.c and hello.h files.

   Like the [216]$LIBPATH variable, the $CPPPATH variable may be a list of
   directories, or a string separated by the system-specific path
   separation character (':' on POSIX/Linux, ';' on Windows). Either way,
   SCons creates the right command-line options so that the following
   example:
       Program('hello.c', CPPPATH = ['include', '/home/project/inc'])

   Will look like this on POSIX or Linux:
       % scons -Q hello
       cc -o hello.o -c -Iinclude -I/home/project/inc hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o

   And like this on Windows:
       C:\>scons -Q hello.exe
       cl /nologo /Iinclude /I\home\project\inc /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
       link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
     __________________________________________________________________

6.4. Caching Implicit Dependencies

   Scanning each file for #include lines does take some extra processing
   time. When you're doing a full build of a large system, the scanning
   time is usually a very small percentage of the overall time spent on
   the build. You're most likely to notice the scanning time, however,
   when you rebuild all or part of a large system: SCons will likely take
   some extra time to "think about" what must be built before it issues
   the first build command (or decides that everything is up to date and
   nothing must be rebuilt).

   In practice, having SCons scan files saves time relative to the amount
   of potential time lost to tracking down subtle problems introduced by
   incorrect dependencies. Nevertheless, the "waiting time" while SCons
   scans files can annoy individual developers waiting for their builds to
   finish. Consequently, SCons lets you cache the implicit dependencies
   that its scanners find, for use by later builds. You can do this by
   specifying the --implicit-cache option on the command line:
       % scons -Q --implicit-cache hello
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       % scons -Q hello
       scons: `hello' is up to date.

   If you don't want to specify --implicit-cache on the command line each
   time, you can make it the default behavior for your build by setting
   the implicit_cache option in an SConscript file:
       SetOption('implicit_cache', 1)

   SCons does not cache implicit dependencies like this by default because
   the --implicit-cache causes SCons to simply use the implicit
   dependencies stored during the last run, without any checking for
   whether or not those dependencies are still correct. Specifically, this
   means --implicit-cache instructs SCons to not rebuild "correctly" in
   the following cases:

     * When --implicit-cache is used, SCons will ignore any changes that
       may have been made to search paths (like $CPPPATH or $LIBPATH,).
       This can lead to SCons not rebuilding a file if a change to
       $CPPPATH would normally cause a different, same-named file from a
       different directory to be used.
     * When --implicit-cache is used, SCons will not detect if a
       same-named file has been added to a directory that is earlier in
       the search path than the directory in which the file was found last
       time.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.4.1. The --implicit-deps-changed Option

   When using cached implicit dependencies, sometimes you want to "start
   fresh" and have SCons re-scan the files for which it previously cached
   the dependencies. For example, if you have recently installed a new
   version of external code that you use for compilation, the external
   header files will have changed and the previously-cached implicit
   dependencies will be out of date. You can update them by running SCons
   with the --implicit-deps-changed option:
         % scons -Q --implicit-deps-changed hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In this case, SCons will re-scan all of the implicit dependencies and
   cache updated copies of the information.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.4.2. The --implicit-deps-unchanged Option

   By default when caching dependencies, SCons notices when a file has
   been modified and re-scans the file for any updated implicit dependency
   information. Sometimes, however, you may want to force SCons to use the
   cached implicit dependencies, even if the source files changed. This
   can speed up a build for example, when you have changed your source
   files but know that you haven't changed any #include lines. In this
   case, you can use the --implicit-deps-unchanged option:
         % scons -Q --implicit-deps-unchanged hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In this case, SCons will assume that the cached implicit dependencies
   are correct and will not bother to re-scan changed files. For typical
   builds after small, incremental changes to source files, the savings
   may not be very big, but sometimes every bit of improved performance
   counts.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.5. Explicit Dependencies: the Depends Function

   Sometimes a file depends on another file that is not detected by an
   SCons scanner. For this situation, SCons allows you to specific
   explicitly that one file depends on another file, and must be rebuilt
   whenever that file changes. This is specified using the Depends method:
       hello = Program('hello.c')
       Depends(hello, 'other_file')

       % scons -Q hello
       cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
       cc -o hello hello.o
       % scons -Q hello
       scons: `hello' is up to date.
       % edit other_file
           [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF other_file]
       % scons -Q hello
       cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
       cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

6.6. Ignoring Dependencies: the Ignore Function

   Sometimes it makes sense to not rebuild a program, even if a dependency
   file changes. In this case, you would tell SCons specifically to ignore
   a dependency as follows:
      hello = Program('hello.c')
      Ignore(hello, 'hello.h')

      % scons -Q hello
      cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q hello
      scons: `hello' is up to date.
      % edit hello.h
        [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
      % scons -Q hello
      scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Now, the above example is a little contrived, because it's hard to
   imagine a real-world situation where you wouldn't want to rebuild hello
   if the hello.h file changed. A more realistic example might be if the
   hello program is being built in a directory that is shared between
   multiple systems that have different copies of the stdio.h include
   file. In that case, SCons would notice the differences between the
   different systems' copies of stdio.h and would rebuild hello each time
   you change systems. You could avoid these rebuilds as follows:
       hello = Program('hello.c')
       Ignore(hello, '/usr/include/stdio.h')
     __________________________________________________________________

6.7. The AlwaysBuild Function

   How SCons handles dependencies can also be affected by the AlwaysBuild
   method. When a file is passed to the AlwaysBuild method, like so:
      hello = Program('hello.c')
      AlwaysBuild(hello)

   Then the specified target file (hello in our example) will always be
   considered out-of-date and rebuilt whenever that target file is
   evaluated while walking the dependency graph:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello hello.o

   The AlwaysBuild function has a somewhat misleading name, because it
   does not actually mean the target file will be rebuilt every single
   time SCons is invoked. Instead, it means that the target will, in fact,
   be rebuilt whenever the target file is encountered while evaluating the
   targets specified on the command line (and their dependencies). So
   specifying some other target on the command line, a target that does
   not itself depend on the AlwaysBuild target, will still be rebuilt only
   if it's out-of-date with respect to its dependencies:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q hello.o
      scons: `hello.o' is up to date.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 7. Construction Environments

   It is rare that all of the software in a large, complicated system
   needs to be built the same way. For example, different source files may
   need different options enabled on the command line, or different
   executable programs need to be linked with different libraries. SCons
   accommodates these different build requirements by allowing you to
   create and configure multiple construction environments that control
   how the software is built. Technically, a construction environment is
   an object that has a number of associated construction variables, each
   with a name and a value. (A construction environment also has an
   attached set of Builder methods, about which we'll learn more later.)

   A construction environment is created by the Environment method:
    env = Environment()

   By default, SCons initializes every new construction environment with a
   set of construction variables based on the tools that it finds on your
   system, plus the default set of builder methods necessary for using
   those tools. The construction variables are initialized with values
   describing the C compiler, the Fortran compiler, the linker, etc., as
   well as the command lines to invoke them.

   When you initialize a construction environment you can set the values
   of the environment's construction variables to control how a program is
   built. For example:
    env = Environment(CC = 'gcc',
                      CCFLAGS = '-O2')

    env.Program('foo.c')

   The construction environment in this example is still initialized with
   the same default construction variable values, except that the user has
   explicitly specified use of the GNU C compiler gcc, and further
   specifies that the -O2 (optimization level two) flag should be used
   when compiling the object file. In other words, the explicit
   initializations of [217]$CC and [218]$CCFLAGS override the default
   values in the newly-created construction environment. So a run from
   this example would look like:
    % scons -Q
    gcc -o foo.o -c -O2 foo.c
    gcc -o foo foo.o
     __________________________________________________________________

7.1. Multiple Construction Environments

   The real advantage of construction environments is that you can create
   as many different construction environments as you need, each tailored
   to a different way to build some piece of software or other file. If,
   for example, we need to build one program with the -O2 flag and another
   with the -g (debug) flag, we would do this like so:
      opt = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
      dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')

      opt.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

      dbg.Program('bar', 'bar.c')

      % scons -Q
      cc -o bar.o -c -g bar.c
      cc -o bar bar.o
      cc -o foo.o -c -O2 foo.c
      cc -o foo foo.o

   We can even use multiple construction environments to build multiple
   versions of a single program. If you do this by simply trying to use
   the [219]Program builder with both environments, though, like this:
      opt = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
      dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')

      opt.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

      dbg.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

   Then SCons generates the following error:
      % scons -Q

      scons: *** Two environments with different actions were specified for the
same target: foo.o
      File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 6, in <module>

   This is because the two Program calls have each implicitly told SCons
   to generate an object file named foo.o, one with a [220]$CCFLAGS value
   of -O2 and one with a [221]$CCFLAGS value of -g. SCons can't just
   decide that one of them should take precedence over the other, so it
   generates the error. To avoid this problem, we must explicitly specify
   that each environment compile foo.c to a separately-named object file
   using the [222]Object builder, like so:
      opt = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
      dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')

      o = opt.Object('foo-opt', 'foo.c')
      opt.Program(o)

      d = dbg.Object('foo-dbg', 'foo.c')
      dbg.Program(d)

   Notice that each call to the Object builder returns a value, an
   internal SCons object that represents the object file that will be
   built. We then use that object as input to the Program builder. This
   avoids having to specify explicitly the object file name in multiple
   places, and makes for a compact, readable SConstruct file. Our SCons
   output then looks like:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o foo-dbg.o -c -g foo.c
      cc -o foo-dbg foo-dbg.o
      cc -o foo-opt.o -c -O2 foo.c
      cc -o foo-opt foo-opt.o
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2. Copying Construction Environments

   Sometimes you want more than one construction environment to share the
   same values for one or more variables. Rather than always having to
   repeat all of the common variables when you create each construction
   environment, you can use the Clone method to create a copy of a
   construction environment.

   Like the Environment call that creates a construction environment, the
   Clone method takes construction variable assignments, which will
   override the values in the copied construction environment. For
   example, suppose we want to use gcc to create three versions of a
   program, one optimized, one debug, and one with neither. We could do
   this by creating a "base" construction environment that sets [223]$CC
   to gcc, and then creating two copies, one which sets [224]$CCFLAGS for
   optimization and the other which sets $CCFLAGS for debugging:
      env = Environment(CC = 'gcc')
      opt = env.Clone(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
      dbg = env.Clone(CCFLAGS = '-g')

      env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

      o = opt.Object('foo-opt', 'foo.c')
      opt.Program(o)

      d = dbg.Object('foo-dbg', 'foo.c')
      dbg.Program(d)

   Then our output would look like:
      % scons -Q
      gcc -o foo.o -c foo.c
      gcc -o foo foo.o
      gcc -o foo-dbg.o -c -g foo.c
      gcc -o foo-dbg foo-dbg.o
      gcc -o foo-opt.o -c -O2 foo.c
      gcc -o foo-opt foo-opt.o
     __________________________________________________________________

7.3. Fetching Values From a Construction Environment

   You can fetch individual construction variables using the normal syntax
   for accessing individual named items in a Python dictionary:
      env = Environment()
      print "CC is:", env['CC']

   This example SConstruct file doesn't build anything, but because it's
   actually a Python script, it will print the value of [225]$CC for us:
      % scons -Q
      CC is: cc
      scons: `.' is up to date.

   A construction environment, however, is actually an object with
   associated methods, etc. If you want to have direct access to only the
   dictionary of construction variables, you can fetch this using the
   Dictionary method:
      env = Environment(FOO = 'foo', BAR = 'bar')
      dict = env.Dictionary()
      for key in ['OBJSUFFIX', 'LIBSUFFIX', 'PROGSUFFIX']:
          print "key = %s, value = %s" % (key, dict[key])

   This SConstruct file will print the specified dictionary items for us
   on POSIX systems as follows:
      % scons -Q
      key = OBJSUFFIX, value = .o
      key = LIBSUFFIX, value = .a
      key = PROGSUFFIX, value =
      scons: `.' is up to date.

   And on Windows:
      C:\>scons -Q
      key = OBJSUFFIX, value = .obj
      key = LIBSUFFIX, value = .lib
      key = PROGSUFFIX, value = .exe
      scons: `.' is up to date.

   If you want to loop through and print the values of all of the
   construction variables in a construction environment, the Python code
   to do that in sorted order might look something like:
      env = Environment()
      dict = env.Dictionary()
      keys = dict.keys()
      keys.sort()
      for key in keys:
          print "construction variable = '%s', value = '%s'" % (key, dict[key])
     __________________________________________________________________

7.4. Expanding Values From a Construction Environment

   Another way to get information from a construction environment. is to
   use the subst method on a string containing $-expansions of
   construction variable names. As a simple example, the example from the
   previous section that used env['CC'] to fetch the value of [226]$CC
   could also be written as:
     env = Environment()
     print "CC is:", env.subst('$CC')

   The real advantage of using subst to expand strings is that
   construction variables in the result get re-expanded until there are no
   expansions left in the string. So a simple fetch of a value like
   [227]$CCCOM:
     env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DFOO')
     print "CCCOM is:", env['CCCOM']

   Will print the unexpanded value of $CCCOM, showing us the construction
   variables that still need to be expanded:
     % scons -Q
     CCCOM is: $CC $CCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPDEFFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET
$SOURCES
     scons: `.' is up to date.

   Calling the subst method on $CCOM, however:
     env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DFOO')
     print "CCCOM is:", env.subst('$CCCOM')

   Will recursively expand all of the $-prefixed construction variables,
   showing us the final output:
     % scons -Q
     CCCOM is: gcc -DFOO -c -o
     scons: `.' is up to date.

   (Note that because we're not expanding this in the context of building
   something there are no target or source files for [228]$TARGET and
   [229]$SOURCES to expand.)
     __________________________________________________________________

7.5. Modifying a Construction Environment

   SCons provides various methods that support modifying existing values
   in a construction environment.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.5.1. Replacing Values in a Construction Environment

   You can replace existing construction variable values using the Replace
   method:
        env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DDEFINE1')
        env.Replace(CCFLAGS = '-DDEFINE2')
        env.Program('foo.c')

   The replacing value (-DDEFINE2 in the above example) completely
   replaces the value in the construction environment:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o foo.o -c -DDEFINE2 foo.c
        cc -o foo foo.o

   You can safely call Replace for construction variables that don't exist
   in the construction environment:
        env = Environment()
        env.Replace(NEW_VARIABLE = 'xyzzy')
        print "NEW_VARIABLE =", env['NEW_VARIABLE']

   In this case, the construction variable simply gets added to the
   construction environment:
        % scons -Q
        NEW_VARIABLE = xyzzy
        scons: `.' is up to date.

   Because the variables aren't expanded until the construction
   environment is actually used to build the targets, and because SCons
   function and method calls are order-independent, the last replacement
   "wins" and is used to build all targets, regardless of the order in
   which the calls to Replace() are interspersed with calls to builder
   methods:
        env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DDEFINE1')
        print "CCFLAGS =", env['CCFLAGS']
        env.Program('foo.c')

        env.Replace(CCFLAGS = '-DDEFINE2')
        print "CCFLAGS =", env['CCFLAGS']
        env.Program('bar.c')

   The timing of when the replacement actually occurs relative to when the
   targets get built becomes apparent if we run scons without the -Q
   option:
        % scons
        scons: Reading SConscript files ...
        CCFLAGS = -DDEFINE1
        CCFLAGS = -DDEFINE2
        scons: done reading SConscript files.
        scons: Building targets ...
        cc -o bar.o -c -DDEFINE2 bar.c
        cc -o bar bar.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DDEFINE2 foo.c
        cc -o foo foo.o
        scons: done building targets.

   Because the replacement occurs while the SConscript files are being
   read, the [230]$CCFLAGS variable has already been set to -DDEFINE2 by
   the time the foo.o target is built, even though the call to the Replace
   method does not occur until later in the SConscript file.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.5.2. Appending to the End of Values in a Construction Environment

   You can append a value to an existing construction variable using the
   Append method:
        env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DMY_VALUE')
        env.Append(CCFLAGS = ' -DLAST')
        env.Program('foo.c')

   SCons then supplies both the -DMY_VALUE and -DLAST flags when compiling
   the object file:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o foo.o -c -DMY_VALUE -DLAST foo.c
        cc -o foo foo.o

   If the construction variable doesn't already exist, the Append method
   will create it:
        env = Environment()
        env.Append(NEW_VARIABLE = 'added')
        print "NEW_VARIABLE =", env['NEW_VARIABLE']

   Which yields:
        % scons -Q
        NEW_VARIABLE = added
        scons: `.' is up to date.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.5.3. Appending to the Beginning of Values in a Construction Environment

   You can append a value to the beginning of an existing construction
   variable using the Prepend method:
        env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DMY_VALUE')
        env.Prepend(CCFLAGS = '-DFIRST ')
        env.Program('foo.c')

   SCons then supplies both the -DFIRST and -DMY_VALUE flags when
   compiling the object file:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o foo.o -c -DFIRST -DMY_VALUE foo.c
        cc -o foo foo.o

   If the construction variable doesn't already exist, the Prepend method
   will create it:
        env = Environment()
        env.Prepend(NEW_VARIABLE = 'added')
        print "NEW_VARIABLE =", env['NEW_VARIABLE']

   Which yields:
        % scons -Q
        NEW_VARIABLE = added
        scons: `.' is up to date.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 8. Controlling the External Environment Used to Execute Build
Commands

   When SCons builds a target file, it does not execute the commands with
   the same external environment that you used to execute SCons. Instead,
   it uses the dictionary stored in the [231]$ENV construction variable as
   the external environment for executing commands.

   The most important ramification of this behavior is that the PATH
   environment variable, which controls where the operating system will
   look for commands and utilities, is not the same as in the external
   environment from which you called SCons. This means that SCons will
   not, by default, necessarily find all of the tools that you can execute
   from the command line.

   The default value of the PATH environment variable on a POSIX system is
   /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin. The default value of the PATH environment
   variable on a Windows system comes from the Windows registry value for
   the command interpreter. If you want to execute any
   commands--compilers, linkers, etc.--that are not in these default
   locations, you need to set the PATH value in the $ENV dictionary in
   your construction environment.

   The simplest way to do this is to initialize explicitly the value when
   you create the construction environment; this is one way to do that:
    path = ['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin']
    env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : path})

   Assign a dictionary to the $ENV construction variable in this way
   completely resets the external environment so that the only variable
   that will be set when external commands are executed will be the PATH
   value. If you want to use the rest of the values in $ENV and only set
   the value of PATH, the most straightforward way is probably:
    env['ENV']['PATH'] = ['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin']

   Note that SCons does allow you to define the directories in the PATH in
   a string, separated by the pathname-separator character for your system
   (':' on POSIX systems, ';' on Windows):
    env['ENV']['PATH'] = '/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin'

   But doing so makes your SConscript file less portable, (although in
   this case that may not be a huge concern since the directories you list
   are likley system-specific, anyway).
     __________________________________________________________________

8.1. Propagating PATH From the External Environment

   You may want to propagate the external PATH to the execution
   environment for commands. You do this by initializing the PATH variable
   with the PATH value from the os.environ dictionary, which is Python's
   way of letting you get at the external environment:
      import os
      env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})

   Alternatively, you may find it easier to just propagate the entire
   external environment to the execution environment for commands. This is
   simpler to code than explicity selecting the PATH value:
      import os
      env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)

   Either of these will guarantee that SCons will be able to execute any
   command that you can execute from the command line. The drawback is
   that the build can behave differently if it's run by people with
   different PATH values in their environment--for example, if both the
   /bin and /usr/local/bin directories have different cc commands, then
   which one will be used to compile programs will depend on which
   directory is listed first in the user's PATH variable.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 9. Controlling a Build From the Command Line

   SCons provides a number of ways that allow the writer of the SConscript
   files to give users a great deal of control over how to run the builds.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.1. Not Having to Specify Command-Line Options Each Time: the SCONSFLAGS
Environment Variable

   Users may find themselves supplying the same command-line options every
   time they run SCons. For example, a user might find that it saves time
   to specify a value of -j 2 to run the builds in parallel. To avoid
   having to type -j 2 by hand every time, you can set the external
   environment variable SCONSFLAGS to a string containing command-line
   options that you want SCons to use.

   If, for example, you're using a POSIX shell that's compatible with the
   Bourne shell, and you always want SCons to use the -Q option, you can
   set the SCONSFLAGS environment as follows:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
          ... [build output] ...
      scons: done building targets.
      % export SCONSFLAGS="-Q"
      % scons
          ... [build output] ...

   Users of csh-style shells on POSIX systems can set the SCONSFLAGS
   environment as follows:
      $ setenv SCONSFLAGS "-Q"

   Windows users may typically want to set the SCONSFLAGS in the
   appropriate tab of the System Properties window.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.2. Getting at Command-Line Targets

   SCons supports a COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable that lets you get at the
   list of targets that the user specified on the command line. You can
   use the targets to manipulate the build in any way you wish. As a
   simple example, suppose that you want to print a reminder to the user
   whenever a specific program is built. You can do this by checking for
   the target in the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS list:
      if 'bar' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
          print "Don't forget to copy `bar' to the archive!"
      Default(Program('foo.c'))
      Program('bar.c')

   Then, running SCons with the default target works as it always does,
   but explicity specifying the bar target on the command line generates
   the warning message:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
      cc -o foo foo.o
      % scons -Q bar
      Don't forget to copy `bar' to the archive!
      cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
      cc -o bar bar.o

   Another practical use for the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable might be to
   speed up a build by only reading certain subsidiary SConscript files if
   a specific target is requested.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.3. Controlling the Default Targets

   One of the most basic things you can control is which targets SCons
   will build by default--that is, when there are no targets specified on
   the command line. As mentioned previously, SCons will normally build
   every target in or below the current directory by default--that is,
   when you don't explicitly specify one or more targets on the command
   line. Sometimes, however, you may want to specify explicitly that only
   certain programs, or programs in certain directories, should be built
   by default. You do this with the Default function:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       env.Program('goodbye.c')
       Default(hello)

   This SConstruct file knows how to build two programs, hello and
   goodbye, but only builds the hello program by default:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       % scons -Q
       scons: `hello' is up to date.
       % scons -Q goodbye
       cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
       cc -o goodbye goodbye.o

   Note that, even when you use the Default function in your SConstruct
   file, you can still explicitly specify the current directory (.) on the
   command line to tell SCons to build everything in (or below) the
   current directory:
       % scons -Q .
       cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
       cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o

   You can also call the Default function more than once, in which case
   each call adds to the list of targets to be built by default:
       env = Environment()
       prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
       Default(prog1)
       prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
       prog3 = env.Program('prog3.c')
       Default(prog3)

   Or you can specify more than one target in a single call to the Default
   function:
       env = Environment()
       prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
       prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
       prog3 = env.Program('prog3.c')
       Default(prog1, prog3)

   Either of these last two examples will build only the prog1 and prog3
   programs by default:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
       cc -o prog1 prog1.o
       cc -o prog3.o -c prog3.c
       cc -o prog3 prog3.o
       % scons -Q .
       cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
       cc -o prog2 prog2.o

   You can list a directory as an argument to Default:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program(['prog1/main.c', 'prog1/foo.c'])
       env.Program(['prog2/main.c', 'prog2/bar.c'])
       Default('prog1')

   In which case only the target(s) in that directory will be built by
   default:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o prog1/foo.o -c prog1/foo.c
       cc -o prog1/main.o -c prog1/main.c
       cc -o prog1/main prog1/main.o prog1/foo.o
       % scons -Q
       scons: `prog1' is up to date.
       % scons -Q .
       cc -o prog2/bar.o -c prog2/bar.c
       cc -o prog2/main.o -c prog2/main.c
       cc -o prog2/main prog2/main.o prog2/bar.o

   Lastly, if for some reason you don't want any targets built by default,
   you can use the Python None variable:
       env = Environment()
       prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
       prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
       Default(None)

   Which would produce build output like:
       % scons -Q
       scons: *** No targets specified and no Default() targets found.  Stop.
       % scons -Q .
       cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
       cc -o prog1 prog1.o
       cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
       cc -o prog2 prog2.o
     __________________________________________________________________

9.3.1. Getting at the List of Default Targets

   SCons supports a DEFAULT_TARGETS variable that lets you get at the
   current list of default targets. The DEFAULT_TARGETS variable has two
   important differences from the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable. First,
   the DEFAULT_TARGETS variable is a list of internal SCons nodes, so you
   need to convert the list elements to strings if you want to print them
   or look for a specific target name. Fortunately, you can do this easily
   by using the Python map function to run the list through str:
         prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
         Default(prog1)
         print "DEFAULT_TARGETS is", map(str, DEFAULT_TARGETS)

   (Keep in mind that all of the manipulation of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list
   takes place during the first phase when SCons is reading up the
   SConscript files, which is obvious if we leave off the -Q flag when we
   run SCons:)
         % scons
         scons: Reading SConscript files ...
         DEFAULT_TARGETS is ['prog1']
         scons: done reading SConscript files.
         scons: Building targets ...
         cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
         cc -o prog1 prog1.o
         scons: done building targets.

   Second, the contents of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list change in response to
   calls to the Default: function, as you can see from the following
   SConstruct file:
         prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
         Default(prog1)
         print "DEFAULT_TARGETS is now", map(str, DEFAULT_TARGETS)
         prog2 = Program('prog2.c')
         Default(prog2)
         print "DEFAULT_TARGETS is now", map(str, DEFAULT_TARGETS)

   Which yields the output:
         % scons
         scons: Reading SConscript files ...
         DEFAULT_TARGETS is now ['prog1']
         DEFAULT_TARGETS is now ['prog1', 'prog2']
         scons: done reading SConscript files.
         scons: Building targets ...
         cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
         cc -o prog1 prog1.o
         cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
         cc -o prog2 prog2.o
         scons: done building targets.

   In practice, this simply means that you need to pay attention to the
   order in which you call the Default function and refer to the
   DEFAULT_TARGETS list, to make sure that you don't examine the list
   before you've added the default targets you expect to find in it.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.4. Getting at the List of Build Targets, Regardless of Origin

   We've already been introduced to the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable,
   which contains a list of targets specified on the command line, and the
   DEFAULT_TARGETS variable, which contains a list of targets specified
   via calls to the Default method or function. Sometimes, however, you
   want a list of whatever targets SCons will try to build, regardless of
   whether the targets came from the command line or a Default call. You
   could code this up by hand, as follows:
      if COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
          targets = COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS
      else:
          targets = DEFAULT_TARGETS

   SCons, however, provides a convenient BUILD_TARGETS variable that
   eliminates the need for this by-hand manipulation. Essentially, the
   BUILD_TARGETS variable contains a list of the command-line targets, if
   any were specified, and if no command-line targets were specified, it
   contains a list of the targets specified via the Default method or
   function.

   Because BUILD_TARGETS may contain a list of SCons nodes, you must
   convert the list elements to strings if you want to print them or look
   for a specific target name, just like the DEFAULT_TARGETS list:
      prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
      Program('prog2.c')
      Default(prog1)
      print "BUILD_TARGETS is", map(str, BUILD_TARGETS)

   Notice how the value of BUILD_TARGETS changes depending on whether a
   target is specified on the command line:
      % scons -Q
      BUILD_TARGETS is ['prog1']
      cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
      cc -o prog1 prog1.o
      % scons -Q prog2
      BUILD_TARGETS is ['prog2']
      cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
      cc -o prog2 prog2.o
      % scons -Q -c .
      BUILD_TARGETS is ['.']
      Removed prog1.o
      Removed prog1
      Removed prog2.o
      Removed prog2
     __________________________________________________________________

9.5. Command-Line variable=value Build Options

   You may want to control various aspects of your build by allowing the
   user to specify variable=value values on the command line. For example,
   suppose you want users to be able to build a debug version of a program
   by running SCons as follows:
      % scons -Q debug=1

   SCons provides an ARGUMENTS dictionary that stores all of the
   variable=value assignments from the command line. This allows you to
   modify aspects of your build in response to specifications on the
   command line. (Note that unless you want to require that users always
   specify an option, you probably want to use the Python ARGUMENTS.get()
   function, which allows you to specify a default value to be used if
   there is no specification on the command line.)

   The following code sets the [232]$CCFLAGS construction variable in
   response to the debug flag being set in the ARGUMENTS dictionary:
       env = Environment()
       debug = ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0)
       if int(debug):
           env.Append(CCFLAGS = '-g')
       env.Program('prog.c')

   This results in the -g compiler option being used when debug=1 is used
   on the command line:
       % scons -Q debug=0
       cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
       cc -o prog prog.o
       % scons -Q debug=0
       scons: `.' is up to date.
       % scons -Q debug=1
       cc -o prog.o -c -g prog.c
       cc -o prog prog.o
       % scons -Q debug=1
       scons: `.' is up to date.

   Notice that SCons keeps track of the last values used to build the
   object files, and as a result correctly rebuilds the object and
   executable files only when the value of the debug argument has changed.

9.6. Controlling Command-Line Build Options

   Being able to use a command-line build option like debug=1 is handy,
   but it can be a chore to write specific Python code to recognize each
   such option and apply the values to a construction variable. To help
   with this, SCons supports a class to define such build options easily,
   and a mechanism to apply the build options to a construction
   environment. This allows you to control how the build options affect
   construction environments.

   For example, suppose that you want users to set a RELEASE construction
   variable on the command line whenever the time comes to build a program
   for release, and that the value of this variable should be added to the
   command line with the appropriate -D option (or other command line
   option) to pass the value to the C compiler. Here's how you might do
   that by setting the appropriate value in a dictionary for the
   [233]$CPPDEFINES construction variable:
         opts = Options()
         opts.Add('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0)
         env = Environment(options = opts,
                           CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD' : '${RELEASE}'})
         env.Program(['foo.c', 'bar.c'])

   This SConstruct file first creates an Options object (the opts =
   Options() call), and then uses the object's Add method to indicate that
   the RELEASE option can be set on the command line, and that it's
   default value will be 0 (the third argument to the Add method). The
   second argument is a line of help text; we'll learn how to use it in
   the next section.

   We then pass the created Options object as an options keyword argument
   to the Environment call used to create the construction environment.
   This then allows a user to set the RELEASE build option on the command
   line and have the variable show up in the command line used to build
   each object from a C source file:
      % scons -Q RELEASE=1
      cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 bar.c
      cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 foo.c
      cc -o foo foo.o bar.o
     __________________________________________________________________

9.7. Providing Help for Command-Line Build Options

   To make command-line build options most useful, you ideally want to
   provide some help text that will describe the available options when
   the user runs scons -h. You could write this text by hand, but SCons
   provides an easier way. Options objects support a GenerateHelpText
   method that will, as its name indicates, generate text that describes
   the various options that have been added to it. You then pass the
   output from this method to the Help function:
         opts = Options('custom.py')
         opts.Add('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0)
         env = Environment(options = opts)
         Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env))

   SCons will now display some useful text when the -h option is used:
      % scons -Q -h

      RELEASE: Set to 1 to build for release
          default: 0
          actual: 0

      Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   Notice that the help output shows the default value, and the current
   actual value of the build option.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.8. Reading Build Options From a File

   Being able to use a command-line build option like debug=1 is handy,
   but it can be a chore to write specific Python code to recognize each
   such option and apply the values to a construction variable. To help
   with this, SCons supports a class to define such build options easily
   and to read build option values from a file. This allows you to control
   how the build options affect construction environments. The way you do
   this is by specifying a file name when you call Options, like custom.py
   in the following example:
         opts = Options('custom.py')
         opts.Add('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0)
         env = Environment(options = opts,
                           CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD' : '${RELEASE}'})
         env.Program(['foo.c', 'bar.c'])
         Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env))

   This then allows us to control the RELEASE variable by setting it in
   the custom.py file:
      RELEASE = 1

   Note that this file is actually executed like a Python script. Now when
   we run SCons:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 bar.c
      cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 foo.c
      cc -o foo foo.o bar.o

   And if we change the contents of custom.py to:
      RELEASE = 0

   The object files are rebuilt appropriately with the new option:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 bar.c
      cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 foo.c
      cc -o foo foo.o bar.o
     __________________________________________________________________

9.9. Canned Build Options

   SCons provides a number of functions that provide ready-made behaviors
   for various types of command-line build options.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.9.1. True/False Values: the BoolOption Build Option

   It's often handy to be able to specify an option that controls a simple
   Boolean variable with a true or false value. It would be even more
   handy to accomodate users who have different preferences for how to
   represent true or false values. The BoolOption function makes it easy
   to accomodate a variety of common values that represent true or false.

   The BoolOption function takes three arguments: the name of the build
   option, the default value of the build option, and the help string for
   the option. It then returns appropriate information for passing to the
   Add method of an Options object, like so:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(BoolOption('RELEASE', 'Set to build for release', 0))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD' : '${RELEASE}'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   With this build option, the RELEASE variable can now be enabled by
   setting it to the value yes or t:
        % scons -Q RELEASE=yes foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=True foo.c

        % scons -Q RELEASE=t foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=True foo.c

   Other values that equate to true include y, 1, on and all.

   Conversely, RELEASE may now be given a false value by setting it to no
   or f:
        % scons -Q RELEASE=no foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=False foo.c

        % scons -Q RELEASE=f foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=False foo.c

   Other values that equate to false include n, 0, off and none.

   Lastly, if a user tries to specify any other value, SCons supplies an
   appropriate error message:
        % scons -Q RELEASE=bad_value foo.o

        scons: *** Error converting option: RELEASE
        Invalid value for boolean option: bad_value
        File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 4, in <module>
     __________________________________________________________________

9.9.2. Single Value From a List: the EnumOption Build Option

   Suppose that we want a user to be able to set a COLOR option that
   selects a background color to be displayed by an application, but that
   we want to restrict the choices to a specific set of allowed colors.
   This can be set up quite easily using the EnumOption, which takes a
   list of allowed_values in addition to the variable name, default value,
   and help text arguments:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(EnumOption('COLOR', 'Set background color', 'red',
                               allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue')))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   The user can now explicity set the COLOR build option to any of the
   specified allowed values:
        % scons -Q COLOR=red foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="red" foo.c
        % scons -Q COLOR=blue foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
        % scons -Q COLOR=green foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c

   But, almost more importantly, an attempt to set COLOR to a value that's
   not in the list generates an error message:
        % scons -Q COLOR=magenta foo.o

        scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: magenta
        File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 5, in <module>

   The EnumOption function also supports a way to map alternate names to
   allowed values. Suppose, for example, that we want to allow the user to
   use the word navy as a synonym for blue. We do this by adding a map
   dictionary that will map its key values to the desired legal value:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(EnumOption('COLOR', 'Set background color', 'red',
                               allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
                               map={'navy':'blue'}))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   As desired, the user can then use navy on the command line, and SCons
   will translate it into blue when it comes time to use the COLOR option
   to build a target:
        % scons -Q COLOR=navy foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c

   By default, when using the EnumOption function, arguments that differ
   from the legal values only in case are treated as illegal values:
        % scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o

        scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: Red
        File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 5, in <module>
        % scons -Q COLOR=BLUE foo.o

        scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: BLUE
        File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 5, in <module>
        % scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o

        scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: nAvY
        File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 5, in <module>

   The EnumOption function can take an additional ignorecase keyword
   argument that, when set to 1, tells SCons to allow case differences
   when the values are specified:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(EnumOption('COLOR', 'Set background color', 'red',
                               allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
                               map={'navy':'blue'},
                               ignorecase=1))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   Which yields the output:
        % scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="Red" foo.c
        % scons -Q COLOR=BLUE foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="BLUE" foo.c
        % scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
        % scons -Q COLOR=green foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c

   Notice that an ignorecase value of 1 preserves the case-spelling that
   the user supplied. If you want SCons to translate the names into
   lower-case, regardless of the case used by the user, specify an
   ignorecase value of 2:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(EnumOption('COLOR', 'Set background color', 'red',
                               allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
                               map={'navy':'blue'},
                               ignorecase=2))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   Now SCons will use values of red, green or blue regardless of how the
   user spells those values on the command line:
        % scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="red" foo.c
        % scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
        % scons -Q COLOR=GREEN foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c
     __________________________________________________________________

9.9.3. Multiple Values From a List: the ListOption Build Option

   Another way in which you might want to allow users to control build
   option is to specify a list of one or more legal values. SCons supports
   this through the ListOption function. If, for example, we want a user
   to be able to set a COLORS option to one or more of the legal list of
   values:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(ListOption('COLORS', 'List of colors', 0,
                               ['red', 'green', 'blue']))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'COLORS' : '"${COLORS}"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   A user can now specify a comma-separated list of legal values, which
   will get translated into a space-separated list for passing to the any
   build commands:
        % scons -Q COLORS=red,blue foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="red blue" foo.c
        % scons -Q COLORS=blue,green,red foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="blue green red" foo.c

   In addition, the ListOption function allows the user to specify
   explicit keywords of all or none to select all of the legal values, or
   none of them, respectively:
        % scons -Q COLORS=all foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="red green blue" foo.c
        % scons -Q COLORS=none foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="" foo.c

   And, of course, an illegal value still generates an error message:
        % scons -Q COLORS=magenta foo.o

        scons: *** Error converting option: COLORS
        Invalid value(s) for option: magenta
        File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 5, in <module>
     __________________________________________________________________

9.9.4. Path Names: the PathOption Build Option

   SCons supports a PathOption function to make it easy to create a build
   option to control an expected path name. If, for example, you need to
   define a variable in the preprocessor that controls the location of a
   configuration file:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(PathOption('CONFIG',
                               'Path to configuration file',
                               '/etc/my_config'))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'CONFIG_FILE' : '"$CONFIG"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   This then allows the user to override the CONFIG build option on the
   command line as necessary:
        % scons -Q foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DCONFIG_FILE="/etc/my_config" foo.c
        % scons -Q CONFIG=/usr/local/etc/other_config foo.o
        scons: `foo.o' is up to date.

   By default, PathOption checks to make sure that the specified path
   exists and generates an error if it doesn't:
        % scons -Q CONFIG=/does/not/exist foo.o

        scons: *** Path for option CONFIG does not exist: /does/not/exist
        File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 6, in <module>

   PathOption provides a number of methods that you can use to change this
   behavior. If you want to ensure that any specified paths are, in fact,
   files and not directories, use the PathOption.PathIsFile method:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(PathOption('CONFIG',
                               'Path to configuration file',
                               '/etc/my_config',
                               PathOption.PathIsFile))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'CONFIG_FILE' : '"$CONFIG"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   Conversely, to ensure that any specified paths are directories and not
   files, use the PathOption.PathIsDir method:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(PathOption('DBDIR',
                               'Path to database directory',
                               '/var/my_dbdir',
                               PathOption.PathIsDir))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'DBDIR' : '"$DBDIR"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   If you want to make sure that any specified paths are directories, and
   you would like the directory created if it doesn't already exist, use
   the PathOption.PathIsDirCreate method:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(PathOption('DBDIR',
                               'Path to database directory',
                               '/var/my_dbdir',
                               PathOption.PathIsDirCreate))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'DBDIR' : '"$DBDIR"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   Lastly, if you don't care whether the path exists, is a file, or a
   directory, use the PathOption.PathAccept method to accept any path that
   the user supplies:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(PathOption('OUTPUT',
                               'Path to output file or directory',
                               None,
                               PathOption.PathAccept))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'OUTPUT' : '"$OUTPUT"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')
     __________________________________________________________________

9.9.5. Enabled/Disabled Path Names: the PackageOption Build Option

   Sometimes you want to give users even more control over a path name
   variable, allowing them to explicitly enable or disable the path name
   by using yes or no keywords, in addition to allow them to supply an
   explicit path name. SCons supports the PackageOption function to
   support this:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(PackageOption('PACKAGE',
                                  'Location package',
                                  '/opt/location'))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'PACKAGE' : '"$PACKAGE"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   When the SConscript file uses the PackageOption funciton, user can now
   still use the default or supply an overriding path name, but can now
   explicitly set the specified variable to a value that indicates the
   package should be enabled (in which case the default should be used) or
   disabled:
        % scons -Q foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="/opt/location" foo.c
        % scons -Q PACKAGE=/usr/local/location foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="/usr/local/location" foo.c
        % scons -Q PACKAGE=yes foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="True" foo.c
        % scons -Q PACKAGE=no foo.o
        cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="False" foo.c
     __________________________________________________________________

9.10. Adding Multiple Command-Line Build Options at Once

   Lastly, SCons provides a way to add multiple build options to an
   Options object at once. Instead of having to call the Add method
   multiple times, you can call the AddOptions method with a list of build
   options to be added to the object. Each build option is specified as
   either a tuple of arguments, just like you'd pass to the Add method
   itself, or as a call to one of the canned functions for pre-packaged
   command-line build options. in any order:
        opts = Options()
        opts.AddOptions(
            ('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0),
            ('CONFIG', 'Configuration file', '/etc/my_config'),
            BoolOption('warnings', 'compilation with -Wall and similiar', 1),

                       allowed_values=('yes', 'no', 'full'),

                       names = list_of_libs),
            PackageOption('x11',
                          'use X11 installed here (yes = search some places)',
                          'yes'),
            PathOption('qtdir', 'where the root of Qt is installed', qtdir),
        )
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 10. Providing Build Help: the Help Function

   It's often very useful to be able to give users some help that
   describes the specific targets, build options, etc., that can be used
   for your build. SCons provides the Help function to allow you to
   specify this help text:
      Help("""
      Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
            'scons debug' to build the debug version.
      """)

   (Note the above use of the Python triple-quote syntax, which comes in
   very handy for specifying multi-line strings like help text.)

   When the SConstruct or SConscript files contain such a call to the Help
   function, the specified help text will be displayed in response to the
   SCons -h option:
      % scons -h
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.

      Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
            'scons debug' to build the debug version.

      Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   The SConscript files may contain multiple calls to the Help function,
   in which case the specified text(s) will be concatenated when
   displayed. This allows you to split up the help text across multiple
   SConscript files. In this situation, the order in which the SConscript
   files are called will determine the order in which the Help functions
   are called, which will determine the order in which the various bits of
   text will get concatenated.

   Another use would be to make the help text conditional on some
   variable. For example, suppose you only want to display a line about
   building a Windows-only version of a program when actually run on
   Windows. The following SConstruct file:
      env = Environment()

      Help("\nType: 'scons program' to build the production program.\n")

      if env['PLATFORM'] == 'win32':
          Help("\nType: 'scons windebug' to build the Windows debug version.\n")

   Will display the complete help text on Windows:
      C:\>scons -h
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.

      Type: 'scons program' to build the production program.

      Type: 'scons windebug' to build the Windows debug version.

      Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   But only show the relevant option on a Linux or UNIX system:
      % scons -h
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.

      Type: 'scons program' to build the production program.

      Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   If there is no Help text in the SConstruct or SConscript files, SCons
   will revert to displaying its standard list that describes the SCons
   command-line options. This list is also always displayed whenever the
   -H option is used.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 11. Installing Files in Other Directories: the Install Builder

   Once a program is built, it is often appropriate to install it in
   another directory for public use. You use the Install method to arrange
   for a program, or any other file, to be copied into a destination
   directory:
     env = Environment()
     hello = env.Program('hello.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)

   Note, however, that installing a file is still considered a type of
   file "build." This is important when you remember that the default
   behavior of SCons is to build files in or below the current directory.
   If, as in the example above, you are installing files in a directory
   outside of the top-level SConstruct file's directory tree, you must
   specify that directory (or a higher directory, such as /) for it to
   install anything there:
     % scons -Q
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     % scons -Q /usr/bin
     Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

   It can, however, be cumbersome to remember (and type) the specific
   destination directory in which the program (or any other file) should
   be installed. This is an area where the Alias function comes in handy,
   allowing you, for example, to create a pseudo-target named install that
   can expand to the specified destination directory:
     env = Environment()
     hello = env.Program('hello.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
     env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   This then yields the more natural ability to install the program in its
   destination as follows:
     % scons -Q
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     % scons -Q install
     Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"
     __________________________________________________________________

11.1. Installing Multiple Files in a Directory

   You can install multiple files into a directory simply by calling the
   Install function multiple times:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
       env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
       env.Install('/usr/bin', goodbye)
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   Or, more succinctly, listing the multiple input files in a list (just
   like you can do with any other builder):
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
       env.Install('/usr/bin', [hello, goodbye])
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   Either of these two examples yields:
       % scons -Q install
       cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
       cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
       Install file: "goodbye" as "/usr/bin/goodbye"
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"
     __________________________________________________________________

11.2. Installing a File Under a Different Name

   The Install method preserves the name of the file when it is copied
   into the destination directory. If you need to change the name of the
   file when you copy it, use the InstallAs function:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       env.InstallAs('/usr/bin/hello-new', hello)
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   This installs the hello program with the name hello-new as follows:
       % scons -Q install
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello-new"
     __________________________________________________________________

11.3. Installing Multiple Files Under Different Names

   Lastly, if you have multiple files that all need to be installed with
   different file names, you can either call the InstallAs function
   multiple times, or as a shorthand, you can supply same-length lists for
   both the target and source arguments:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
       env.InstallAs(['/usr/bin/hello-new',
                      '/usr/bin/goodbye-new'],
                     [hello, goodbye])
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   In this case, the InstallAs function loops through both lists
   simultaneously, and copies each source file into its corresponding
   target file name:
       % scons -Q install
       cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
       cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
       Install file: "goodbye" as "/usr/bin/goodbye-new"
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello-new"
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 12. Platform-Independent File System Manipulation

   SCons provides a number of platform-independent functions, called
   factories, that perform common file system manipulations like copying,
   moving or deleting files and directories, or making directories. These
   functions are factories because they don't perform the action at the
   time they're called, they each return an Action object that can be
   executed at the appropriate time.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.1. Copying Files or Directories: The Copy Factory

   Suppose you want to arrange to make a copy of a file, and the Install
   builder isn't appropriate because it may make a hard link on POSIX
   systems. One way would be to use the Copy action factory in conjunction
   with the Command builder:
        Command("file.out", "file.in", Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"))

   Notice that the action returned by the Copy factory will expand the
   [234]$TARGET and [235]$SOURCE strings at the time file.out is built,
   and that the order of the arguments is the same as that of a builder
   itself--that is, target first, followed by source:
       % scons -Q
       Copy("file.out", "file.in")

   You can, of course, name a file explicitly instead of using $TARGET or
   $SOURCE:
      Command("file.out", [], Copy("$TARGET", "file.in"))

   Which executes as:
      % scons -Q
      Copy("file.out", "file.in")

   The usefulness of the Copy factory becomes more apparent when you use
   it in a list of actions passed to the Command builder. For example,
   suppose you needed to run a file through a utility that only modifies
   files in-place, and can't "pipe" input to output. One solution is to
   copy the source file to a temporary file name, run the utility, and
   then copy the modified temporary file to the target, which the Copy
   factory makes extremely easy:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
                "modify tempfile",
                Copy("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
              ])

   The output then looks like:
      % scons -Q
      Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
      modify tempfile
      Copy("file.out", "tempfile")
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2. Deleting Files or Directories: The Delete Factory

   If you need to delete a file, then the Delete factory can be used in
   much the same way as the Copy factory. For example, if we want to make
   sure that the temporary file in our last example doesn't exist before
   we copy to it, we could add Delete to the beginning of the command
   list:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Delete("tempfile"),
                Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
                "modify tempfile",
                Copy("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
              ])

   When then executes as follows:
      % scons -Q
      Delete("tempfile")
      Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
      modify tempfile
      Copy("file.out", "tempfile")

   Of course, like all of these Action factories, the Delete factory also
   expands [236]$TARGET and [237]$SOURCE variables appropriately. For
   example:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Delete("$TARGET"),
                Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE")
              ])

   Executes as:
      % scons -Q
      Delete("file.out")
      Copy("file.out", "file.in")

   (Note, however, that you typically don't need to call the Delete
   factory explicitly in this way; by default, SCons deletes its target(s)
   for you before executing any action.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.3. Moving (Renaming) Files or Directories: The Move Factory

   The Move factory allows you to rename a file or directory. For example,
   if we don't want to copy the temporary file, we could use:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
                "modify tempfile",
                Move("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
              ])

   Which would execute as:
      % scons -Q
      Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
      modify tempfile
      Move("file.out", "tempfile")
     __________________________________________________________________

12.4. Updating the Modification Time of a File: The Touch Factory

   If you just need to update the recorded modification time for a file,
   use the Touch factory:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"),
                Touch("$TARGET"),
              ])

   Which executes as:
      % scons -Q
      Copy("file.out", "file.in")
      Touch("file.out")
     __________________________________________________________________

12.5. Creating a Directory: The Mkdir Factory

   If you need to create a directory, use the Mkdir factory. For example,
   if we need to process a file in a temporary directory in which the
   processing tool will create other files that we don't care about, you
   could use:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Delete("tempdir"),
                Mkdir("tempdir"),
                Copy("tempdir/${SOURCE.file}", "$SOURCE"),
                "process tempdir",
                Move("$TARGET", "tempdir/output_file"),
                Delete("tempdir"),
              ])

   Which executes as:
      % scons -Q
      Delete("tempdir")
      Mkdir("tempdir")
      Copy("tempdir/file.in", "file.in")
      process tempdir
      Move("file.out", "tempdir/output_file")
      scons: *** [file.out] No such file or directory
     __________________________________________________________________

12.6. Changing File or Directory Permissions: The Chmod Factory

   To change permissions on a file or directory, use the Chmod factory.
   The permission argument uses POSIX-style permission bits and should
   typically be expressed as an octal, not decimal, number:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"),
                Chmod("$TARGET", 0755),
              ])

   Which executes:
      % scons -Q
      Copy("file.out", "file.in")
      Chmod("file.out", 0755)
     __________________________________________________________________

12.7. Executing an action immediately: the Execute Function

   We've been showing you how to use Action factories in the Command
   function. You can also execute an Action returned by a factory (or
   actually, any Action) at the time the SConscript file is read by
   wrapping it up in the Execute function. For example, if we need to make
   sure that a directory exists before we build any targets,
      Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/my_temp_directory'))

   Notice that this will create the directory while the SConscript file is
   being read:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      Mkdir("/tmp/my_temp_directory")
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      scons: `.' is up to date.
      scons: done building targets.

   If you're familiar with Python, you may wonder why you would want to
   use this instead of just calling the native Python os.mkdir() function.
   The advantage here is that the Mkdir action will behave appropriately
   if the user specifies the SCons -n or -q options--that is, it will
   print the action but not actually make the directory when -n is
   specified, or make the directory but not print the action when -q is
   specified.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 13. Preventing Removal of Targets

   There are two occasions when SCons will, by default, remove target
   files. The first is when SCons determines that an target file needs to
   be rebuilt and removes the existing version of the target before
   executing The second is when SCons is invoked with the -c option to
   "clean" a tree of its built targets. These behaviours can be suppressed
   with the Precious and NoClean functions, respectively.
     __________________________________________________________________

13.1. Preventing target removal during build: the Precious Function

   By default, SCons removes targets before building them. Sometimes,
   however, this is not what you want. For example, you may want to update
   a library incrementally, not by having it deleted and then rebuilt from
   all of the constituent object files. In such cases, you can use the
   Precious method to prevent SCons from removing the target before it is
   built:
        env = Environment(RANLIBCOM='')
        lib = env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
        env.Precious(lib)

   Although the output doesn't look any different, SCons does not, in
   fact, delete the target library before rebuilding it:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
        cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
        cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
        ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o

   SCons will, however, still delete files marked as Precious when the -c
   option is used.
     __________________________________________________________________

13.2. Preventing target removal during clean: the NoClean Function

   By default, SCons removes all built targets when invoked with the -c
   option to clean a source tree of built targets. Sometimes, however,
   this is not what you want. For example, you may want to remove only
   intermediate generated files (such as object files), but leave the
   final targets (the libraries) untouched. In such cases, you can use the
   NoClean method to prevent SCons from removing a target during a clean:
        env = Environment(RANLIBCOM='')
        lib = env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
        env.NoClean(lib)

   Notice that the libfoo.a is not listed as a removed file:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
        cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
        cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
        ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
        % scons -c
        scons: Reading SConscript files ...
        scons: done reading SConscript files.
        scons: Cleaning targets ...
        Removed f1.o
        Removed f2.o
        Removed f3.o
        scons: done cleaning targets.
     __________________________________________________________________

13.3. Removing additional files during clean: the Clean Function

   There may be additional files that you want removed when the -c option
   is used, but which SCons doesn't know about because they're not normal
   target files. For example, perhaps a command you invoke creates a log
   file as part of building the target file you want. You would like the
   log file cleaned, but you don't want to have to teach SCons that the
   command "builds" two files.

   You can use the Clean function to arrange for additional files to be
   removed when the -c option is used. Notice, however, that the Clean
   function takes two arguments, and the second argument is the name of
   the additional file you want cleaned (foo.log in this example):
        t = Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', 'build -o $TARGET $SOURCE')
        Clean(t, 'foo.log')

   The first argument is the target with which you want the cleaning of
   this additional file associated. In the above example, we've used the
   return value from the Command function, which represents the foo.out
   target. Now whenever the foo.out target is cleaned by the -c option,
   the foo.log file will be removed as well:
        % scons -Q
        build -o foo.out foo.in
        % scons -Q -c
        Removed foo.out
        Removed foo.log
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 14. Hierarchical Builds

   The source code for large software projects rarely stays in a single
   directory, but is nearly always divided into a hierarchy of
   directories. Organizing a large software build using SCons involves
   creating a hierarchy of build scripts using the SConscript function.
     __________________________________________________________________

14.1. SConscript Files

   As we've already seen, the build script at the top of the tree is
   called SConstruct. The top-level SConstruct file can use the SConscript
   function to include other subsidiary scripts in the build. These
   subsidiary scripts can, in turn, use the SConscript function to include
   still other scripts in the build. By convention, these subsidiary
   scripts are usually named SConscript. For example, a top-level
   SConstruct file might arrange for four subsidiary scripts to be
   included in the build as follows:
      SConscript(['drivers/display/SConscript',
                  'drivers/mouse/SConscript',
                  'parser/SConscript',
                  'utilities/SConscript'])

   In this case, the SConstruct file lists all of the SConscript files in
   the build explicitly. (Note, however, that not every directory in the
   tree necessarily has an SConscript file.) Alternatively, the drivers
   subdirectory might contain an intermediate SConscript file, in which
   case the SConscript call in the top-level SConstruct file would look
   like:
      SConscript(['drivers/SConscript',
                  'parser/SConscript',
                  'utilities/SConscript'])

   And the subsidiary SConscript file in the drivers subdirectory would
   look like:
      SConscript(['display/SConscript',
                  'mouse/SConscript'])

   Whether you list all of the SConscript files in the top-level
   SConstruct file, or place a subsidiary SConscript file in intervening
   directories, or use some mix of the two schemes, is up to you and the
   needs of your software.
     __________________________________________________________________

14.2. Path Names Are Relative to the SConscript Directory

   Subsidiary SConscript files make it easy to create a build hierarchy
   because all of the file and directory names in a subsidiary SConscript
   files are interpreted relative to the directory in which the SConscript
   file lives. Typically, this allows the SConscript file containing the
   instructions to build a target file to live in the same directory as
   the source files from which the target will be built, making it easy to
   update how the software is built whenever files are added or deleted
   (or other changes are made).

   For example, suppose we want to build two programs prog1 and prog2 in
   two separate directories with the same names as the programs. One
   typical way to do this would be with a top-level SConstruct file like
   this:
      SConscript(['prog1/SConscript',
                  'prog2/SConscript'])

   And subsidiary SConscript files that look like this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('prog1', ['main.c', 'foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   And this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('prog2', ['main.c', 'bar1.c', 'bar2.c'])

   Then, when we run SCons in the top-level directory, our build looks
   like:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o prog1/foo1.o -c prog1/foo1.c
       cc -o prog1/foo2.o -c prog1/foo2.c
       cc -o prog1/main.o -c prog1/main.c
       cc -o prog1/prog1 prog1/main.o prog1/foo1.o prog1/foo2.o
       cc -o prog2/bar1.o -c prog2/bar1.c
       cc -o prog2/bar2.o -c prog2/bar2.c
       cc -o prog2/main.o -c prog2/main.c
       cc -o prog2/prog2 prog2/main.o prog2/bar1.o prog2/bar2.o

   Notice the following: First, you can have files with the same names in
   multiple directories, like main.c in the above example. Second, unlike
   standard recursive use of Make, SCons stays in the top-level directory
   (where the SConstruct file lives) and issues commands that use the path
   names from the top-level directory to the target and source files
   within the hierarchy.
     __________________________________________________________________

14.3. Top-Level Path Names in Subsidiary SConscript Files

   If you need to use a file from another directory, it's sometimes more
   convenient to specify the path to a file in another directory from the
   top-level SConstruct directory, even when you're using that file in a
   subsidiary SConscript file in a subdirectory. You can tell SCons to
   interpret a path name as relative to the top-level SConstruct
   directory, not the local directory of the SConscript file, by appending
   a # (hash mark) to the beginning of the path name:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program('prog', ['main.c', '#lib/foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   In this example, the lib directory is directly underneath the top-level
   SConstruct directory. If the above SConscript file is in a subdirectory
   named src/prog, the output would look like:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o lib/foo1.o -c lib/foo1.c
       cc -o src/prog/foo2.o -c src/prog/foo2.c
       cc -o src/prog/main.o -c src/prog/main.c
       cc -o src/prog/prog src/prog/main.o lib/foo1.o src/prog/foo2.o

   (Notice that the lib/foo1.o object file is built in the same directory
   as its source file. See [238]Chapter 15, below, for information about
   how to build the object file in a different subdirectory.)
     __________________________________________________________________

14.4. Absolute Path Names

   Of course, you can always specify an absolute path name for a file--for
   example:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program('prog', ['main.c', '/usr/joe/lib/foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   Which, when executed, would yield:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o src/prog/foo2.o -c src/prog/foo2.c
       cc -o src/prog/main.o -c src/prog/main.c
       cc -o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o -c /usr/joe/lib/foo1.c
       cc -o src/prog/prog src/prog/main.o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o src/prog/foo2.o

   (As was the case with top-relative path names, notice that the
   /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o object file is built in the same directory as its
   source file. See [239]Chapter 15, below, for information about how to
   build the object file in a different subdirectory.)
     __________________________________________________________________

14.5. Sharing Environments (and Other Variables) Between SConscript Files

   In the previous example, each of the subsidiary SConscript files
   created its own construction environment by calling Environment
   separately. This obviously works fine, but if each program must be
   built with the same construction variables, it's cumbersome and
   error-prone to initialize separate construction environments in the
   same way over and over in each subsidiary SConscript file.

   SCons supports the ability to export variables from a parent SConscript
   file to its subsidiary SConscript files, which allows you to share
   common initialized values throughout your build hierarchy.
     __________________________________________________________________

14.5.1. Exporting Variables

   There are two ways to export a variable, such as a construction
   environment, from an SConscript file, so that it may be used by other
   SConscript files. First, you can call the Export function with a list
   of variables, or a string of white-space separated variable names. Each
   call to Export adds one or more variables to a global list of variables
   that are available for import by other SConscript files.
        env = Environment()
        Export('env')

   You may export more than one variable name at a time:
        env = Environment()
        debug = ARGUMENTS['debug']
        Export('env', 'debug')

   Because white space is not legal in Python variable names, the Export
   function will even automatically split a string into separate names for
   you:
        Export('env debug')

   Second, you can specify a list of variables to export as a second
   argument to the SConscript function call:
        SConscript('src/SConscript', 'env')

   Or as the exports keyword argument:
        SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='env')

   These calls export the specified variables to only the listed
   SConscript files. You may, however, specify more than one SConscript
   file in a list:
        SConscript(['src1/SConscript',
                    'src2/SConscript'], exports='env')

   This is functionally equivalent to calling the SConscript function
   multiple times with the same exports argument, one per SConscript file.
     __________________________________________________________________

14.5.2. Importing Variables

   Once a variable has been exported from a calling SConscript file, it
   may be used in other SConscript files by calling the Import function:
        Import('env')
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   The Import call makes the env construction environment available to the
   SConscript file, after which the variable can be used to build
   programs, libraries, etc.

   Like the Export function, the Import function can be used with multiple
   variable names:
        Import('env', 'debug')
        env = env.Clone(DEBUG = debug)
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   And the Import function will similarly split a string along white-space
   into separate variable names:
        Import('env debug')
        env = env.Clone(DEBUG = debug)
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   Lastly, as a special case, you may import all of the variables that
   have been exported by supplying an asterisk to the Import function:
        Import('*')
        env = env.Clone(DEBUG = debug)
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   If you're dealing with a lot of SConscript files, this can be a lot
   simpler than keeping arbitrary lists of imported variables in each
   file.
     __________________________________________________________________

14.5.3. Returning Values From an SConscript File

   Sometimes, you would like to be able to use information from a
   subsidiary SConscript file in some way. For example, suppose that you
   want to create one library from source files scattered throughout a
   number of subsidiary SConscript files. You can do this by using the
   Return function to return values from the subsidiary SConscript files
   to the calling file.

   If, for example, we have two subdirectories foo and bar that should
   each contribute a source file to a Library, what we'd like to be able
   to do is collect the object files from the subsidiary SConscript calls
   like this:
          env = Environment()
          Export('env')
          objs = []
          for subdir in ['foo', 'bar']:
              o = SConscript('%s/SConscript' % subdir)
              objs.append(o)
          env.Library('prog', objs)

   We can do this by using the Return function in the foo/SConscript file
   like this:
          Import('env')
          obj = env.Object('foo.c')
          Return('obj')

   (The corresponding bar/SConscript file should be pretty obvious.) Then
   when we run SCons, the object files from the subsidiary subdirectories
   are all correctly archived in the desired library:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o bar/bar.o -c bar/bar.c
        cc -o foo/foo.o -c foo/foo.c
        ar rc libprog.a foo/foo.o bar/bar.o
        ranlib libprog.a
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 15. Separating Source and Build Directories

   It's often useful to keep any built files completely separate from the
   source files. In SCons, this is usually done by creating one or more
   separate variant directory trees that are used to hold the built
   objects files, libraries, and executable programs, etc. for a specific
   flavor, or variant, of build. SCons provides two ways to do this, one
   through the SConscript function that we've already seen, and the second
   through a more flexible VariantDir function.

   One historical note: the VariantDir function used to be called
   BuildDir. That name is still supported but has been deprecated because
   the SCons functionality differs from the model of a "build directory"
   implemented by other build systems like the GNU Autotools.
     __________________________________________________________________

15.1. Specifying a Variant Directory Tree as Part of an SConscript Call

   The most straightforward way to establish a variant directory tree uses
   the fact that the usual way to set up a build hierarchy is to have an
   SConscript file in the source subdirectory. If you then pass a
   variant_dir argument to the SConscript function call:
      SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build')

   SCons will then build all of the files in the build subdirectory:
      % ls src
      SConscript  hello.c
      % scons -Q
      cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
      cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
      % ls build
      SConscript  hello  hello.c  hello.o

   But wait a minute--what's going on here? SCons created the object file
   build/hello.o in the build subdirectory, as expected. But even though
   our hello.c file lives in the src subdirectory, SCons has actually
   compiled a build/hello.c file to create the object file.

   What's happened is that SCons has duplicated the hello.c file from the
   src subdirectory to the build subdirectory, and built the program from
   there. The next section explains why SCons does this.
     __________________________________________________________________

15.2. Why SCons Duplicates Source Files in a Variant Directory Tree

   SCons duplicates source files in variant directory trees because it's
   the most straightforward way to guarantee a correct build regardless of
   include-file directory paths, relative references between files, or
   tool support for putting files in different locations, and the SCons
   philosophy is to, by default, guarantee a correct build in all cases.

   The most direct reason to duplicate source files in variant directories
   is simply that some tools (mostly older vesions) are written to only
   build their output files in the same directory as the source files. In
   this case, the choices are either to build the output file in the
   source directory and move it to the variant directory, or to duplicate
   the source files in the variant directory.

   Additionally, relative references between files can cause problems if
   we don't just duplicate the hierarchy of source files in the variant
   directory. You can see this at work in use of the C preprocessor
   #include mechanism with double quotes, not angle brackets:
      #include "file.h"

   The de facto standard behavior for most C compilers in this case is to
   first look in the same directory as the source file that contains the
   #include line, then to look in the directories in the preprocessor
   search path. Add to this that the SCons implementation of support for
   code repositories (described below) means not all of the files will be
   found in the same directory hierarchy, and the simplest way to make
   sure that the right include file is found is to duplicate the source
   files into the variant directory, which provides a correct build
   regardless of the original location(s) of the source files.

   Although source-file duplication guarantees a correct build even in
   these end-cases, it can usually be safely disabled. The next section
   describes how you can disable the duplication of source files in the
   variant directory.
     __________________________________________________________________

15.3. Telling SCons to Not Duplicate Source Files in the Variant Directory
Tree

   In most cases and with most tool sets, SCons can place its target files
   in a build subdirectory without duplicating the source files and
   everything will work just fine. You can disable the default SCons
   behavior by specifying duplicate=0 when you call the SConscript
   function:
      SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build', duplicate=0)

   When this flag is specified, SCons uses the variant directory like most
   people expect--that is, the output files are placed in the variant
   directory while the source files stay in the source directory:
      % ls src
      SConscript
      hello.c
      % scons -Q
      cc -c src/hello.c -o build/hello.o
      cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
      % ls build
      hello
      hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

15.4. The VariantDir Function

   Use the VariantDir function to establish that target files should be
   built in a separate directory from the source files:
      VariantDir('build', 'src')
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('build/hello.c')

   Note that when you're not using an SConscript file in the src
   subdirectory, you must actually specify that the program must be built
   from the build/hello.c file that SCons will duplicate in the build
   subdirectory.

   When using the VariantDir function directly, SCons still duplicates the
   source files in the variant directory by default:
      % ls src
      hello.c
      % scons -Q
      cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
      cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
      % ls build
      hello  hello.c  hello.o

   You can specify the same duplicate=0 argument that you can specify for
   an SConscript call:
      VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=0)
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('build/hello.c')

   In which case SCons will disable duplication of the source files:
      % ls src
      hello.c
      % scons -Q
      cc -o build/hello.o -c src/hello.c
      cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
      % ls build
      hello  hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

15.5. Using VariantDir With an SConscript File

   Even when using the VariantDir function, it's much more natural to use
   it with a subsidiary SConscript file. For example, if the
   src/SConscript looks like this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('hello.c')

   Then our SConstruct file could look like:
      VariantDir('build', 'src')
      SConscript('build/SConscript')

   Yielding the following output:
      % ls src
      SConscript  hello.c
      % scons -Q
      cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
      cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
      % ls build
      SConscript  hello  hello.c  hello.o

   Notice that this is completely equivalent to the use of SConscript that
   we learned about in the previous section.
     __________________________________________________________________

15.6. Using Glob() with VariantDir

   The Glob() file name pattern matching function works just as usual when
   using VariantDir. For example, if the src/SConscript looks like this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('hello', Glob('*.c'))

   Then with the same SConstruct file as in the previous section, and
   source files f1.c and f2.c in src, we would see the following output:
      % ls src
      SConscript  f1.c  f2.c  f2.h
      % scons -Q
      cc -o build/f1.o -c build/f1.c
      cc -o build/f2.o -c build/f2.c
      cc -o build/hello build/f1.o build/f2.o
      % ls build
      SConscript  f1.c  f1.o  f2.c  f2.h  f2.o  hello

   The Glob function returns Nodes in the build/ tree, as you'd expect.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 16. Variant Builds

   The variant_dir keyword argument of the SConscript function provides
   everything we need to show how easy it is to create variant builds
   using SCons. Suppose, for example, that we want to build a program for
   both Windows and Linux platforms, but that we want to build it in a
   shared directory with separate side-by-side build directories for the
   Windows and Linux versions of the program.
    platform = ARGUMENTS.get('OS', Platform())

    include = "#export/$PLATFORM/include"
    lib = "#export/$PLATFORM/lib"
    bin = "#export/$PLATFORM/bin"

    env = Environment(PLATFORM = platform,
                      BINDIR = bin,
                      INCDIR = include,
                      LIBDIR = lib,
                      CPPPATH = [include],
                      LIBPATH = [lib],
                      LIBS = 'world')

    Export('env')

    env.SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/$PLATFORM')

   This SConstruct file, when run on a Linux system, yields:
    % scons -Q OS=linux
    Install file: "build/linux/world/world.h" as "export/linux/include/world.h"
    cc -o build/linux/hello/hello.o -c -Iexport/linux/include build/linux/hello/
hello.c
    cc -o build/linux/world/world.o -c -Iexport/linux/include build/linux/world/
world.c
    ar rc build/linux/world/libworld.a build/linux/world/world.o
    ranlib build/linux/world/libworld.a
    Install file: "build/linux/world/libworld.a" as "export/linux/lib/libworld.a
"
    cc -o build/linux/hello/hello build/linux/hello/hello.o -Lexport/linux/lib -
lworld
    Install file: "build/linux/hello/hello" as "export/linux/bin/hello"

   The same SConstruct file on Windows would build:
    C:\>scons -Q OS=windows
    Install file: "build/windows/world/world.h" as "export/windows/include/world
.h"
    cl /nologo /Iexport\windows\include /c build\windows\hello\hello.c /Fobuild\
windows\hello\hello.obj
    cl /nologo /Iexport\windows\include /c build\windows\world\world.c /Fobuild\
windows\world\world.obj
    lib /nologo /OUT:build\windows\world\world.lib build\windows\world\world.obj
    Install file: "build/windows/world/world.lib" as "export/windows/lib/world.l
ib"
    link /nologo /OUT:build\windows\hello\hello.exe /LIBPATH:export\windows\lib
world.lib build\windows\hello\hello.obj
    Install file: "build/windows/hello/hello.exe" as "export/windows/bin/hello.e
xe"
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 17. Writing Your Own Builders

   Although SCons provides many useful methods for building common
   software products: programs, libraries, documents. you frequently want
   to be able to build some other type of file not supported directly by
   SCons Fortunately, SCons makes it very easy to define your own Builder
   objects for any custom file types you want to build. (In fact, the
   SCons interfaces for creating Builder objects are flexible enough and
   easy enough to use that all of the the SCons built-in Builder objects
   are created the mechanisms described in this section.)
     __________________________________________________________________

17.1. Writing Builders That Execute External Commands

   The simplest Builder to create is one that executes an external
   command. For example, if we want to build an output file by running the
   contents of the input file through a command named foobuild, creating
   that Builder might look like:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')

   All the above line does is create a free-standing Builder object. The
   next section will show us how to actually use it.
     __________________________________________________________________

17.2. Attaching a Builder to a Construction Environment

   A Builder object isn't useful until it's attached to a construction
   environment so that we can call it to arrange for files to be built.
   This is done through the [240]$BUILDERS construction variable in an
   environment. The $BUILDERS variable is a Python dictionary that maps
   the names by which you want to call various Builder objects to the
   objects themselves. For example, if we want to call the Builder we just
   defined by the name Foo, our SConstruct file might look like:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})

   With the Builder so attached to our construction environment we can now
   actually call it like so:
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')

   Then when we run SCons it looks like:
      % scons -Q
      foobuild < file.input > file.foo

   Note, however, that the default $BUILDERS variable in a construction
   environment comes with a default set of Builder objects already
   defined: [241]Program, [242]Library, etc. And when we explicitly set
   the $BUILDERS variable when we create the construction environment, the
   default Builders are no longer part of the environment:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
       env.Program('hello.c')

      % scons -Q
      AttributeError: SConsEnvironment instance has no attribute 'Program':
        File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 4:
          env.Program('hello.c')

   To be able to use both our own defined Builder objects and the default
   Builder objects in the same construction environment, you can either
   add to the $BUILDERS variable using the Append function:
       env = Environment()
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env.Append(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
       env.Program('hello.c')

   Or you can explicitly set the appropriately-named key in the $BUILDERS
   dictionary:
       env = Environment()
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env['BUILDERS']['Foo'] = bld
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
       env.Program('hello.c')

   Either way, the same construction environment can then use both the
   newly-defined Foo Builder and the default [243]Program Builder:
      % scons -Q
      foobuild < file.input > file.foo
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

17.3. Letting SCons Handle The File Suffixes

   By supplying additional information when you create a Builder, you can
   let SCons add appropriate file suffixes to the target and/or the source
   file. For example, rather than having to specify explicitly that you
   want the Foo Builder to build the file.foo target file from the
   file.input source file, you can give the .foo and .input suffixes to
   the Builder, making for more compact and readable calls to the Foo
   Builder:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET',
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file1')
       env.Foo('file2')

      % scons -Q
      foobuild < file1.input > file1.foo
      foobuild < file2.input > file2.foo

   You can also supply a prefix keyword argument if it's appropriate to
   have SCons append a prefix to the beginning of target file names.
     __________________________________________________________________

17.4. Builders That Execute Python Functions

   In SCons, you don't have to call an external command to build a file.
   You can, instead, define a Python function that a Builder object can
   invoke to build your target file (or files). Such a builder function
   definition looks like:
       def build_function(target, source, env):
           # Code to build "target" from "source"
           return None

   The arguments of a builder function are:

   target
          A list of Node objects representing the target or targets to be
          built by this builder function. The file names of these
          target(s) may be extracted using the Python str function.

   source
          A list of Node objects representing the sources to be used by
          this builder function to build the targets. The file names of
          these source(s) may be extracted using the Python str function.

   env
          The construction environment used for building the target(s).
          The builder function may use any of the environment's
          construction variables in any way to affect how it builds the
          targets.

   The builder function must return a 0 or None value if the target(s) are
   built successfully. The builder function may raise an exception or
   return any non-zero value to indicate that the build is unsuccessful,

   Once you've defined the Python function that will build your target
   file, defining a Builder object for it is as simple as specifying the
   name of the function, instead of an external command, as the Builder's
   action argument:
       def build_function(target, source, env):
           # Code to build "target" from "source"
           return None
       bld = Builder(action = build_function,
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file')

   And notice that the output changes slightly, reflecting the fact that a
   Python function, not an external command, is now called to build the
   target file:
      % scons -Q
      build_function(["file.foo"], ["file.input"])
     __________________________________________________________________

17.5. Builders That Create Actions Using a Generator

   SCons Builder objects can create an action "on the fly" by using a
   function called a generator. This provides a great deal of flexibility
   to construct just the right list of commands to build your target. A
   generator looks like:
       def generate_actions(source, target, env, for_signature):
           return 'foobuild < %s > %s' % (target[0], source[0])

   The arguments of a generator are:

   source
          A list of Node objects representing the sources to be built by
          the command or other action generated by this function. The file
          names of these source(s) may be extracted using the Python str
          function.

   target
          A list of Node objects representing the target or targets to be
          built by the command or other action generated by this function.
          The file names of these target(s) may be extracted using the
          Python str function.

   env
          The construction environment used for building the target(s).
          The generator may use any of the environment's construction
          variables in any way to determine what command or other action
          to return.

   for_signature
          A flag that specifies whether the generator is being called to
          contribute to a build signature, as opposed to actually
          executing the command.

   The generator must return a command string or other action that will be
   used to build the specified target(s) from the specified source(s).

   Once you've defined a generator, you create a Builder to use it by
   specifying the generator keyword argument instead of action.
       def generate_actions(source, target, env, for_signature):
           return 'foobuild < %s > %s' % (source[0], target[0])
       bld = Builder(generator = generate_actions,
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file')

      % scons -Q
      foobuild < file.input > file.foo

   Note that it's illegal to specify both an action and a generator for a
   Builder.
     __________________________________________________________________

17.6. Builders That Modify the Target or Source Lists Using an Emitter

   SCons supports the ability for a Builder to modify the lists of
   target(s) from the specified source(s).
       def modify_targets(target, source, env):
           target.append('new_target')
           source.append('new_source')
           return target, source
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild $TARGETS - $SOURCES',
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input',
                     emitter = modify_targets)
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file')

      % scons -Q
      foobuild file.foo new_target - file.input new_source

       bld = Builder(action = 'my_command',
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input',
                     emitter = 'MY_EMITTER')
       def modify1(target, source, env):
           return target, source
       def modify2(target, source, env):
           return target, source
       env1 = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld},
                          MY_EMITTER = modify1)
       env2 = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld},
                          MY_EMITTER = modify2)
       env1.Foo('file1')
       env2.Foo('file2')
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 18. Not Writing a Builder: the Command Builder

   Creating a Builder and attaching it to a construction environment
   allows for a lot of flexibility when you want to re-use actions to
   build multiple files of the same type. This can, however, be cumbersome
   if you only need to execute one specific command to build a single file
   (or group of files). For these situations, SCons supports a Command
   Builder that arranges for a specific action to be executed to build a
   specific file or files. This looks a lot like the other builders (like
   [244]Program, [245]Object, etc.), but takes as an additional argument
   the command to be executed to build the file:
     env = Environment()
     env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', "sed 's/x/y/' < $SOURCE > $TARGET")

   When executed, SCons runs the specified command, substituting
   [246]$SOURCE and [247]$TARGET as expected:
    % scons -Q
    sed 's/x/y/' < foo.in > foo.out

   This is often more convenient than creating a Builder object and adding
   it to the [248]$BUILDERS variable of a construction environment

   Note that the action you specify to the Command Builder can be any
   legal SCons Action, such as a Python function:
     env = Environment()
     def build(target, source, env):
         # Whatever it takes to build
         return None
     env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', build)

   Which executes as follows:
    % scons -Q
    build(["foo.out"], ["foo.in"])
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 19. Pseudo-Builders: the AddMethod function

   The env.AddMethod(function, [name]) function is used to add a method to
   an environment. It's typically used to add a "pseudo-builder" or wrap
   up a call to multiple builders. In the first example, we want to
   install the program into the standard bin dir, but also copy it into a
   local install/bin dir that might be used to build a package from.
     def install_in_bin_dirs(env, source):
         """Install source in both bin dirs"""
         i1 = env.Install("$BIN", source)
         i2 = env.Install("$LOCALBIN", source)
         return [i1[0], i2][0] # Return a list, like a normal builder
     env = Environment(BIN='/usr/bin', LOCALBIN='#install/bin')
     env.AddMethod(install_in_bin_dirs, "InstallInBinDirs")
     env.InstallInBinDirs(Program('hello.c')) # installs hello in both bin dirs


   This produces the following:
    % scons -Q
    cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
    cc -o hello hello.o
    Install file: "hello" as "install/bin/hello"

   It also gives more flexibility in parsing arguments than you can get
   with a builder. The next example shows a pseudo-builder with a named
   argument that modifies the filename, and a separate argument for the
   resource file (rather than having the builder figure it out by file
   extension). Also this example demonstrates using the global AddMethod
   function to add a method to the global Environment class, so it will be
   used in all subsequently created environments.
     import sys
     def BuildTestProg(env, testfile, resourcefile, testdir="tests"):
         """Build the test program;
         prepends "test_" to src and target, and puts target into testdir."""
         srcfile="test_%s.c"%testfile
         if sys.platform=='win32':
             target="%s/test_%s$EXESUFFIX"%(testdir,[testfile, resourcefile])
         else:
             target="%s/test_%s$EXESUFFIX"%(testdir,testfile)
         p = env.Program(target, srcfile)
         return p
     AddMethod(Environment, BuildTestProg)

     # Now use it
     env=Environment()
     env.BuildTestProg('stuff', resourcefile='res.rc')

   This produces the following (on Linux, anyway; Windows would include
   the resource file):
    % scons -Q
    cc -o test_stuff.o -c test_stuff.c
    cc -o tests/test_stuff test_stuff.o
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 20. Writing Scanners

   SCons has built-in scanners that know how to look in C, Fortran and IDL
   source files for information about other files that targets built from
   those files depend on--for example, in the case of files that use the C
   preprocessor, the .h files that are specified using #include lines in
   the source. You can use the same mechanisms that SCons uses to create
   its built-in scanners to write scanners of your own for file types that
   SCons does not know how to scan "out of the box."
     __________________________________________________________________

20.1. A Simple Scanner Example

   Suppose, for example, that we want to create a simple scanner for .foo
   files. A .foo file contains some text that will be processed, and can
   include other files on lines that begin with include followed by a file
   name:
      include filename.foo

   Scanning a file will be handled by a Python function that you must
   supply. Here is a function that will use the Python re module to scan
   for the include lines in our example:
      import re

      include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

      def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg):
          contents = node.get_contents()
          return include_re.findall(contents)

   The scanner function must accept the four specified arguments and
   return a list of implicit dependencies. Presumably, these would be
   dependencies found from examining the contents of the file, although
   the function can perform any manipulation at all to generate the list
   of dependencies.

   node
          An SCons node object representing the file being scanned. The
          path name to the file can be used by converting the node to a
          string using the str() function, or an internal SCons
          get_contents() object method can be used to fetch the contents.

   env
          The construction environment in effect for this scan. The
          scanner function may choose to use construction variables from
          this environment to affect its behavior.

   path
          A list of directories that form the search path for included
          files for this scanner. This is how SCons handles the
          [249]$CPPPATH and [250]$LIBPATH variables.

   arg
          An optional argument that you can choose to have passed to this
          scanner function by various scanner instances.

   A Scanner object is created using the Scanner function, which typically
   takes an skeys argument to associate the type of file suffix with this
   scanner. The Scanner object must then be associated with the
   [251]$SCANNERS construction variable of a construction environment,
   typically by using the Append method:
       kscan = Scanner(function = kfile_scan,
                       skeys = ['.k'])
       env.Append(SCANNERS = kscan)

   When we put it all together, it looks like:
        import re

        include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

        def kfile_scan(node, env, path):
            contents = node.get_contents()
            includes = include_re.findall(contents)
            return includes

        kscan = Scanner(function = kfile_scan,
                        skeys = ['.k'])

        env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : '/usr/local/bin'})
        env.Append(SCANNERS = kscan)

        env.Command('foo', 'foo.k', 'kprocess < $SOURCES > $TARGET')
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 21. Building From Code Repositories

   Often, a software project will have one or more central repositories,
   directory trees that contain source code, or derived files, or both.
   You can eliminate additional unnecessary rebuilds of files by having
   SCons use files from one or more code repositories to build files in
   your local build tree.
     __________________________________________________________________

21.1. The Repository Method

   It's often useful to allow multiple programmers working on a project to
   build software from source files and/or derived files that are stored
   in a centrally-accessible repository, a directory copy of the source
   code tree. (Note that this is not the sort of repository maintained by
   a source code management system like BitKeeper, CVS, or Subversion.)
   You use the Repository method to tell SCons to search one or more
   central code repositories (in order) for any source files and derived
   files that are not present in the local build tree:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program('hello.c')
       Repository('/usr/repository1', '/usr/repository2')

   Multiple calls to the Repository method will simply add repositories to
   the global list that SCons maintains, with the exception that SCons
   will automatically eliminate the current directory and any non-existent
   directories from the list.
     __________________________________________________________________

21.2. Finding source files in repositories

   The above example specifies that SCons will first search for files
   under the /usr/repository1 tree and next under the /usr/repository2
   tree. SCons expects that any files it searches for will be found in the
   same position relative to the top-level directory. In the above
   example, if the hello.c file is not found in the local build tree,
   SCons will search first for a /usr/repository1/hello.c file and then
   for a /usr/repository2/hello.c file to use in its place.

   So given the SConstruct file above, if the hello.c file exists in the
   local build directory, SCons will rebuild the hello program as normal:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   If, however, there is no local hello.c file, but one exists in
   /usr/repository1, SCons will recompile the hello program from the
   source file it finds in the repository:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c /usr/repository1/hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   And similarly, if there is no local hello.c file and no
   /usr/repository1/hello.c, but one exists in /usr/repository2:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c /usr/repository2/hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

21.3. Finding #include files in repositories

   We've already seen that SCons will scan the contents of a source file
   for #include file names and realize that targets built from that source
   file also depend on the #include file(s). For each directory in the
   [252]$CPPPATH list, SCons will actually search the corresponding
   directories in any repository trees and establish the correct
   dependencies on any #include files that it finds in repository
   directory.

   Unless the C compiler also knows about these directories in the
   repository trees, though, it will be unable to find the #include files.
   If, for example, the hello.c file in our previous example includes the
   hello.h; in its current directory, and the hello.h; only exists in the
   repository:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      hello.c:1: hello.h: No such file or directory

   In order to inform the C compiler about the repositories, SCons will
   add appropriate -I flags to the compilation commands for each directory
   in the $CPPPATH list. So if we add the current directory to the
   construction environment $CPPPATH like so:
       env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
       env.Program('hello.c')
       Repository('/usr/repository1')

   Then re-executing SCons yields:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c -I. -I/usr/repository1 hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   The order of the -I options replicates, for the C preprocessor, the
   same repository-directory search path that SCons uses for its own
   dependency analysis. If there are multiple repositories and multiple
   $CPPPATH directories, SCons will add the repository directories to the
   beginning of each $CPPPATH directory, rapidly multiplying the number of
   -I flags. If, for example, the $CPPPATH contains three directories (and
   shorter repository path names!):
       env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['dir1', 'dir2', 'dir3'])
       env.Program('hello.c')
       Repository('/r1', '/r2')

   Then we'll end up with nine -I options on the command line, three (for
   each of the $CPPPATH directories) times three (for the local directory
   plus the two repositories):
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c -Idir1 -I/r1/dir1 -I/r2/dir1 -Idir2 -I/r1/dir2 -I/r2/dir2
 -Idir3 -I/r1/dir3 -I/r2/dir3 hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

21.3.1. Limitations on #include files in repositories

   SCons relies on the C compiler's -I options to control the order in
   which the preprocessor will search the repository directories for
   #include files. This causes a problem, however, with how the C
   preprocessor handles #include lines with the file name included in
   double-quotes.

   As we've seen, SCons will compile the hello.c file from the repository
   if it doesn't exist in the local directory. If, however, the hello.c
   file in the repository contains a #include line with the file name in
   double quotes:
        #include "hello.h"
        int
        main(int argc, char *argv[])
        {
            printf(HELLO_MESSAGE);
            return (0);
        }

   Then the C preprocessor will always use a hello.h file from the
   repository directory first, even if there is a hello.h file in the
   local directory, despite the fact that the command line specifies -I as
   the first option:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o hello.o -c -I. -I/usr/repository1 /usr/repository1/hello.c
        cc -o hello hello.o

   This behavior of the C preprocessor--always search for a #include file
   in double-quotes first in the same directory as the source file, and
   only then search the -I--can not, in general, be changed. In other
   words, it's a limitation that must be lived with if you want to use
   code repositories in this way. There are three ways you can possibly
   work around this C preprocessor behavior:

    1. Some modern versions of C compilers do have an option to disable or
       control this behavior. If so, add that option to [253]$CFLAGS (or
       [254]$CXXFLAGS or both) in your construction environment(s). Make
       sure the option is used for all construction environments that use
       C preprocessing!
    2. Change all occurrences of #include "file.h" to #include <file.h>.
       Use of #include with angle brackets does not have the same
       behavior--the -I directories are searched first for #include
       files--which gives SCons direct control over the list of
       directories the C preprocessor will search.
    3. Require that everyone working with compilation from repositories
       check out and work on entire directories of files, not individual
       files. (If you use local wrapper scripts around your source code
       control system's command, you could add logic to enforce this
       restriction there.
     __________________________________________________________________

21.4. Finding the SConstruct file in repositories

   SCons will also search in repositories for the SConstruct file and any
   specified SConscript files. This poses a problem, though: how can SCons
   search a repository tree for an SConstruct file if the SConstruct file
   itself contains the information about the pathname of the repository?
   To solve this problem, SCons allows you to specify repository
   directories on the command line using the -Y option:
      % scons -Q -Y /usr/repository1 -Y /usr/repository2

   When looking for source or derived files, SCons will first search the
   repositories specified on the command line, and then search the
   repositories specified in the SConstruct or SConscript files.
     __________________________________________________________________

21.5. Finding derived files in repositories

   If a repository contains not only source files, but also derived files
   (such as object files, libraries, or executables), SCons will perform
   its normal MD5 signature calculation to decide if a derived file in a
   repository is up-to-date, or the derived file must be rebuilt in the
   local build directory. For the SCons signature calculation to work
   correctly, a repository tree must contain the .sconsign files that
   SCons uses to keep track of signature information.

   Usually, this would be done by a build integrator who would run SCons
   in the repository to create all of its derived files and .sconsign
   files, or who would run SCons in a separate build directory and copy
   the resulting tree to the desired repository:
      % cd /usr/repository1
      % scons -Q
      cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
      cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o file1.o file2.o

   (Note that this is safe even if the SConstruct file lists
   /usr/repository1 as a repository, because SCons will remove the current
   build directory from its repository list for that invocation.)

   Now, with the repository populated, we only need to create the one
   local source file we're interested in working with at the moment, and
   use the -Y option to tell SCons to fetch any other files it needs from
   the repository:
      % cd $HOME/build
      % edit hello.c
      % scons -Q -Y /usr/repository1
      cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o /usr/repository1/file1.o /usr/repository1/file2.o

   Notice that SCons realizes that it does not need to rebuild local
   copies file1.o and file2.o files, but instead uses the already-compiled
   files from the repository.
     __________________________________________________________________

21.6. Guaranteeing local copies of files

   If the repository tree contains the complete results of a build, and we
   try to build from the repository without any files in our local tree,
   something moderately surprising happens:
      % mkdir $HOME/build2
      % cd $HOME/build2
      % scons -Q -Y /usr/all/repository hello
      scons: `hello' is up-to-date.

   Why does SCons say that the hello program is up-to-date when there is
   no hello program in the local build directory? Because the repository
   (not the local directory) contains the up-to-date hello program, and
   SCons correctly determines that nothing needs to be done to rebuild
   that up-to-date copy of the file.

   There are, however, many times when you want to ensure that a local
   copy of a file always exists. A packaging or testing script, for
   example, may assume that certain generated files exist locally. To tell
   SCons to make a copy of any up-to-date repository file in the local
   build directory, use the Local function:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       Local(hello)

   If we then run the same command, SCons will make a local copy of the
   program from the repository copy, and tell you that it is doing so:
      % scons -Y /usr/all/repository hello
      Local copy of hello from /usr/all/repository/hello
      scons: `hello' is up-to-date.

   (Notice that, because the act of making the local copy is not
   considered a "build" of the hello file, SCons still reports that it is
   up-to-date.)

Chapter 22. Multi-Platform Configuration (Autoconf Functionality)

   SCons has integrated support for multi-platform build configuration
   similar to that offered by GNU Autoconf, such as figuring out what
   libraries or header files are available on the local system. This
   section describes how to use this SCons feature.

   Note

        This chapter is still under development, so not everything is explained
        as well as it should be. See the SCons man page for additional
        information.
     __________________________________________________________________

22.1. Configure Contexts

   The basic framework for multi-platform build configuration in SCons is
   to attach a configure context to a construction environment by calling
   the Configure function, perform a number of checks for libraries,
   functions, header files, etc., and to then call the configure context's
   Finish method to finish off the configuration:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    # Checks for libraries, header files, etc. go here!
    env = conf.Finish()

   SCons provides a number of basic checks, as well as a mechanism for
   adding your own custom checks.

   Note that SCons uses its own dependency mechanism to determine when a
   check needs to be run--that is, SCons does not run the checks every
   time it is invoked, but caches the values returned by previous checks
   and uses the cached values unless something has changed. This saves a
   tremendous amount of developer time while working on cross-platform
   build issues.

   The next sections describe the basic checks that SCons supports, as
   well as how to add your own custom checks.
     __________________________________________________________________

22.2. Checking for the Existence of Header Files

   Testing the existence of a header file requires knowing what language
   the header file is. A configure context has a CheckCHeader method that
   checks for the existence of a C header file:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckCHeader('math.h'):
        print 'Math.h must be installed!'
        Exit(1)
    if conf.CheckCHeader('foo.h'):
        conf.env.Append('-DHAS_FOO_H')
    env = conf.Finish()

   Note that you can choose to terminate the build if a given header file
   doesn't exist, or you can modify the construction environment based on
   the existence of a header file.

   If you need to check for the existence a C++ header file, use the
   CheckCXXHeader method:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckCXXHeader('vector.h'):
        print 'vector.h must be installed!'
        Exit(1)
    env = conf.Finish()
     __________________________________________________________________

22.3. Checking for the Availability of a Function

   Check for the availability of a specific function using the CheckFunc
   method:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckFunc('strcpy'):
        print 'Did not find strcpy(), using local version'
        conf.env.Append('-Dstrcpy=my_local_strcpy')
    env = conf.Finish()
     __________________________________________________________________

22.4. Checking for the Availability of a Library

   Check for the availability of a library using the CheckLib method. You
   only specify the basename of the library, you don't need to add a lib
   prefix or a .a or .lib suffix:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckLib('m'):
        print 'Did not find libm.a or m.lib, exiting!'
        Exit(1)
    env = conf.Finish()

   Because the ability to use a library successfully often depends on
   having access to a header file that describes the library's interface,
   you can check for a library and a header file at the same time by using
   the CheckLibWithHeader method:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckLibWithHeader('m', 'math.h'):
        print 'Did not find libm.a or m.lib, exiting!'
        Exit(1)
    env = conf.Finish()

   This is essentially shorthand for separate calls to the CheckHeader and
   CheckLib functions.
     __________________________________________________________________

22.5. Checking for the Availability of a typedef

   Check for the availability of a typedef by using the CheckType method:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckType('off_t'):
        print 'Did not find off_t typedef, assuming int'
        conf.env.Append(CCFLAGS = '-Doff_t=int')
    env = conf.Finish()

   You can also add a string that will be placed at the beginning of the
   test file that will be used to check for the typedef. This provide a
   way to specify files that must be included to find the typedef:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckType('off_t', '#include <sys/types.h>\n'):
        print 'Did not find off_t typedef, assuming int'
        conf.env.Append(CCFLAGS = '-Doff_t=int')
    env = conf.Finish()
     __________________________________________________________________

22.6. Adding Your Own Custom Checks

   A custom check is a Python function that checks for a certain condition
   to exist on the running system, usually using methods that SCons
   supplies to take care of the details of checking whether a compilation
   succeeds, a link succeeds, a program is runnable, etc. A simple custom
   check for the existence of a specific library might look as follows:
    mylib_test_source_file = """
    #include <mylib.h>
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        MyLibrary mylib(argc, argv);
        return 0;
    }
    """

    def CheckMyLibrary(context):
        context.Message('Checking for MyLibrary...')
        result = context.TryLink(mylib_test_source_file, '.c')
        context.Result(result)
        return result

   The Message and Result methods should typically begin and end a custom
   check to let the user know what's going on: the Message call prints the
   specified message (with no trailing newline) and the Result call prints
   ok if the check succeeds and failed if it doesn't. The TryLink method
   actually tests for whether the specified program text will successfully
   link.

   (Note that a custom check can modify its check based on any arguments
   you choose to pass it, or by using or modifying the configure context
   environment in the context.env attribute.)

   This custom check function is then attached to the configure context by
   passing a dictionary to the Configure call that maps a name of the
   check to the underlying function:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env, custom_tests = {'CheckMyLibrary' : CheckMyLibrary})

   You'll typically want to make the check and the function name the same,
   as we've done here, to avoid potential confusion.

   We can then put these pieces together and actually call the
   CheckMyLibrary check as follows:
    mylib_test_source_file = """
    #include <mylib.h>
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        MyLibrary mylib(argc, argv);
        return 0;
    }
    """

    def CheckMyLibrary(context):
        context.Message('Checking for MyLibrary... ')
        result = context.TryLink(mylib_test_source_file, '.c')
        context.Result(result)
        return result

    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env, custom_tests = {'CheckMyLibrary' : CheckMyLibrary})
    if not conf.CheckMyLibrary():
        print 'MyLibrary is not installed!'
        Exit(1)
    env = conf.Finish()

    # We would then add actual calls like Program() to build
    # something using the "env" construction environment.

   If MyLibrary is not installed on the system, the output will look like:
    % scons
    scons: Reading SConscript file ...
    Checking for MyLibrary... failed
    MyLibrary is not installed!

   If MyLibrary is installed, the output will look like:
    % scons
    scons: Reading SConscript file ...
    Checking for MyLibrary... failed
    scons: done reading SConscript
    scons: Building targets ...
        .
        .
        .
     __________________________________________________________________

22.7. Not Configuring When Cleaning Targets

   Using multi-platform configuration as described in the previous
   sections will run the configuration commands even when invoking scons
   -c to clean targets:
    % scons -Q -c
    Checking for MyLibrary... ok
    Removed foo.o
    Removed foo

   Although running the platform checks when removing targets doesn't hurt
   anything, it's usually unnecessary. You can avoid this by using the
   GetOption(); method to check whether the -c (clean) option has been
   invoked on the command line:
    env = Environment()
    if not env.GetOption('clean'):
        conf = Configure(env, custom_tests = {'CheckMyLibrary' : CheckMyLibrary}
)
        if not conf.CheckMyLibrary():
            print 'MyLibrary is not installed!'
            Exit(1)
        env = conf.Finish()

    % scons -Q -c
    Removed foo.o
    Removed foo
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 23. Caching Built Files

   On multi-developer software projects, you can sometimes speed up every
   developer's builds a lot by allowing them to share the derived files
   that they build. SCons makes this easy, as well as reliable.
     __________________________________________________________________

23.1. Specifying the Shared Cache Directory

   To enable sharing of derived files, use the CacheDir function in any
   SConscript file:
       CacheDir('/usr/local/build_cache')

   Note that the directory you specify must already exist and be readable
   and writable by all developers who will be sharing derived files. It
   should also be in some central location that all builds will be able to
   access. In environments where developers are using separate systems
   (like individual workstations) for builds, this directory would
   typically be on a shared or NFS-mounted file system.

   Here's what happens: When a build has a CacheDir specified, every time
   a file is built, it is stored in the shared cache directory along with
   its MD5 build signature. [255][3] On subsequent builds, before an
   action is invoked to build a file, SCons will check the shared cache
   directory to see if a file with the exact same build signature already
   exists. If so, the derived file will not be built locally, but will be
   copied into the local build directory from the shared cache directory,
   like so:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q
      Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
      Retrieved `hello' from cache
     __________________________________________________________________

23.2. Keeping Build Output Consistent

   One potential drawback to using a shared cache is that the output
   printed by SCons can be inconsistent from invocation to invocation,
   because any given file may be rebuilt one time and retrieved from the
   shared cache the next time. This can make analyzing build output more
   difficult, especially for automated scripts that expect consistent
   output each time.

   If, however, you use the --cache-show option, SCons will print the
   command line that it would have executed to build the file, even when
   it is retrieving the file from the shared cache. This makes the build
   output consistent every time the build is run:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q --cache-show
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   The trade-off, of course, is that you no longer know whether or not
   SCons has retrieved a derived file from cache or has rebuilt it
   locally.
     __________________________________________________________________

23.3. Not Using the Shared Cache for Specific Files

   You may want to disable caching for certain specific files in your
   configuration. For example, if you only want to put executable files in
   a central cache, but not the intermediate object files, you can use the
   NoCache function to specify that the object files should not be cached:
       env = Environment()
       obj = env.Object('hello.c')
       env.Program('hello.c')
       CacheDir('cache')
       NoCache('hello.o')

   Then when you run scons after cleaning the built targets, it will
   recompile the object file locally (since it doesn't exist in the shared
   cache directory), but still realize that the shared cache directory
   contains an up-to-date executable program that can be retrieved instead
   of re-linking:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      Retrieved `hello' from cache
     __________________________________________________________________

23.4. Disabling the Shared Cache

   Retrieving an already-built file from the shared cache is usually a
   significant time-savings over rebuilding the file, but how much of a
   savings (or even whether it saves time at all) can depend a great deal
   on your system or network configuration. For example, retrieving cached
   files from a busy server over a busy network might end up being slower
   than rebuilding the files locally.

   In these cases, you can specify the --cache-disable command-line option
   to tell SCons to not retrieve already-built files from the shared cache
   directory:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q
      Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
      Retrieved `hello' from cache
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q --cache-disable
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

23.5. Populating a Shared Cache With Already-Built Files

   Sometimes, you may have one or more derived files already built in your
   local build tree that you wish to make available to other people doing
   builds. For example, you may find it more effective to perform
   integration builds with the cache disabled (per the previous section)
   and only populate the shared cache directory with the built files after
   the integration build has completed successfully. This way, the cache
   will only get filled up with derived files that are part of a complete,
   successful build not with files that might be later overwritten while
   you debug integration problems.

   In this case, you can use the the --cache-force option to tell SCons to
   put all derived files in the cache, even if the files already exist in
   your local tree from having been built by a previous invocation:
      % scons -Q --cache-disable
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q --cache-disable
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q --cache-force
      scons: `.' is up to date.
      % scons -Q
      scons: `.' is up to date.

   Notice how the above sample run demonstrates that the --cache-disable
   option avoids putting the built hello.o and hello files in the cache,
   but after using the --cache-force option, the files have been put in
   the cache for the next invocation to retrieve.
     __________________________________________________________________

23.6. Minimizing Cache Contention: the --random Option

   If you allow multiple builds to update the shared cache directory
   simultaneously, two builds that occur at the same time can sometimes
   start "racing" with one another to build the same files in the same
   order. If, for example, you are linking multiple files into an
   executable program:
       Program('prog',
               ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c', 'f4.c', 'f5.c'])

   SCons will normally build the input object files on which the program
   depends in their normal, sorted order:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
      cc -o f4.o -c f4.c
      cc -o f5.o -c f5.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o f5.o

   But if two such builds take place simultaneously, they may each look in
   the cache at nearly the same time and both decide that f1.o must be
   rebuilt and pushed into the shared cache directory, then both decide
   that f2.o must be rebuilt (and pushed into the shared cache directory),
   then both decide that f3.o must be rebuilt... This won't cause any
   actual build problems--both builds will succeed, generate correct
   output files, and populate the cache--but it does represent wasted
   effort.

   To alleviate such contention for the cache, you can use the --random
   command-line option to tell SCons to build dependencies in a random
   order:
      % scons -Q --random
      cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
      cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
      cc -o f5.o -c f5.c
      cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
      cc -o f4.o -c f4.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o f5.o

   Multiple builds using the --random option will usually build their
   dependencies in different, random orders, which minimizes the chances
   for a lot of contention for same-named files in the shared cache
   directory. Multiple simultaneous builds might still race to try to
   build the same target file on occasion, but long sequences of
   inefficient contention should be rare.

   Note, of course, the --random option will cause the output that SCons
   prints to be inconsistent from invocation to invocation, which may be
   an issue when trying to compare output from different build runs.

   If you want to make sure dependencies will be built in a random order
   without having to specify the --random on very command line, you can
   use the SetOption function to set the random option within any
   SConscript file:
       Program('prog',
               ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c', 'f4.c', 'f5.c'])

       SetOption('random', 1)
       Program('prog',
               ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c', 'f4.c', 'f5.c'])
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 24. Alias Targets

   We've already seen how you can use the Alias function to create a
   target named install:
     env = Environment()
     hello = env.Program('hello.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
     env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   You can then use this alias on the command line to tell SCons more
   naturally that you want to install files:
     % scons -Q install
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

   Like other Builder methods, though, the Alias method returns an object
   representing the alias being built. You can then use this object as
   input to anothother Builder. This is especially useful if you use such
   an object as input to another call to the Alias Builder, allowing you
   to create a hierarchy of nested aliases:
     env = Environment()
     p = env.Program('foo.c')
     l = env.Library('bar.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', p)
     env.Install('/usr/lib', l)
     ib = env.Alias('install-bin', '/usr/bin')
     il = env.Alias('install-lib', '/usr/lib')
     env.Alias('install', [ib, il])

   This example defines separate install, install-bin, and install-lib
   aliases, allowing you finer control over what gets installed:
     % scons -Q install-bin
     cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
     cc -o foo foo.o
     Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
     % scons -Q install-lib
     cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
     ar rc libbar.a bar.o
     ranlib libbar.a
     Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"
     % scons -Q -c /
     Removed foo.o
     Removed foo
     Removed /usr/bin/foo
     Removed bar.o
     Removed libbar.a
     Removed /usr/lib/libbar.a
     % scons -Q install
     cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
     cc -o foo foo.o
     Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
     cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
     ar rc libbar.a bar.o
     ranlib libbar.a
     Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 25. Java Builds

   So far, we've been using examples of building C and C++ programs to
   demonstrate the features of SCons. SCons also supports building Java
   programs, but Java builds are handled slightly differently, which
   reflects the ways in which the Java compiler and tools build programs
   differently than other languages' tool chains.
     __________________________________________________________________

25.1. Building Java Class Files: the Java Builder

   The basic activity when programming in Java, of course, is to take one
   or more .java files containing Java source code and to call the Java
   compiler to turn them into one or more .class files. In SCons, you do
   this by giving the [256]Java Builder a target directory in which to put
   the .class files, and a source directory that contains the .java files:
      Java('classes', 'src')

   If the src directory contains three .java source files, then running
   SCons might look like this:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/E
xample3.java

   SCons will actually search the src directory tree for all of the .java
   files. The Java compiler will then create the necessary class files in
   the classes subdirectory, based on the class names found in the .java
   files.
     __________________________________________________________________

25.2. How SCons Handles Java Dependencies

   In addition to searching the source directory for .java files, SCons
   actually runs the .java files through a stripped-down Java parser that
   figures out what classes are defined. In other words, SCons knows,
   without you having to tell it, what .class files will be produced by
   the javac call. So our one-liner example from the preceding section:
      Java('classes', 'src')

   Will not only tell you reliably that the .class files in the classes
   subdirectory are up-to-date:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/E
xample3.java
      % scons -Q classes
      scons: `classes' is up to date.

   But it will also remove all of the generated .class files, even for
   inner classes, without you having to specify them manually. For
   example, if our Example1.java and Example3.java files both define
   additional classes, and the class defined in Example2.java has an inner
   class, running scons -c will clean up all of those .class files as
   well:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/E
xample3.java
      % scons -Q -c classes
      Removed classes/Example1.class
      Removed classes/AdditionalClass1.class
      Removed classes/Example2$Inner2.class
      Removed classes/Example2.class
      Removed classes/Example3.class
      Removed classes/AdditionalClass3.class
     __________________________________________________________________

25.3. Building Java Archive (.jar) Files: the Jar Builder

   After building the class files, it's common to collect them into a Java
   archive (.jar) file, which you do by calling the [257]Jar Builder
   method. If you want to just collect all of the class files within a
   subdirectory, you can just specify that subdirectory as the Jar source:
      Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
      Jar(target = 'test.jar', source = 'classes')

   SCons will then pass that directory to the jar command, which will
   collect all of the underlying .class files:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/E
xample3.java
      jar cf test.jar classes

   If you want to keep all of the .class files for multiple programs in
   one location, and only archive some of them in each .jar file, you can
   pass the Jar builder a list of files as its source. It's extremely
   simple to create multiple .jar files this way, using the lists of
   target class files created by calls to the [258]Java builder as sources
   to the various Jar calls:
      prog1_class_files = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'prog1')
      prog2_class_files = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'prog2')
      Jar(target = 'prog1.jar', source = prog1_class_files)
      Jar(target = 'prog2.jar', source = prog2_class_files)

   This will then create prog1.jar and prog2.jar next to the
   subdirectories that contain their .java files:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath prog1 prog1/Example1.java prog1/Example2.java
      javac -d classes -sourcepath prog2 prog2/Example3.java prog2/Example4.java
      jar cf prog1.jar -C classes Example1.class -C classes Example2.class
      jar cf prog2.jar -C classes Example3.class -C classes Example4.class

25.4. Building C Header and Stub Files: the JavaH Builder

   You can generate C header and source files for implementing native
   methods, by using the [259]JavaH Builder. There are several ways of
   using the JavaH Builder. One typical invocation might look like:
      classes = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src/pkg/sub')
      JavaH(target = 'native', source = classes)

   The source is a list of class files generated by the call to the
   [260]Java Builder, and the target is the output directory in which we
   want the C header files placed. The target gets converted into the -d
   when SCons runs javah:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg
/sub/Example2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
      javah -d native -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg.s
ub.Example3

   In this case, the call to javah will generate the header files
   native/pkg_sub_Example1.h, native/pkg_sub_Example2.h and
   native/pkg_sub_Example3.h. Notice that SCons remembered that the class
   files were generated with a target directory of classes, and that it
   then specified that target directory as the -classpath option to the
   call to javah.

   Although it's more convenient to use the list of class files returned
   by the Java Builder as the source of a call to the JavaH Builder, you
   can specify the list of class files by hand, if you prefer. If you do,
   you need to set the [261]$JAVACLASSDIR construction variable when
   calling JavaH:
      Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src/pkg/sub')
      class_file_list = ['classes/pkg/sub/Example1.class',
                         'classes/pkg/sub/Example2.class',
                         'classes/pkg/sub/Example3.class']
      JavaH(target = 'native', source = class_file_list, JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes
')

   The $JAVACLASSDIR value then gets converted into the -classpath when
   SCons runs javah:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg
/sub/Example2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
      javah -d native -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg.s
ub.Example3

   Lastly, if you don't want a separate header file generated for each
   source file, you can specify an explicit File Node as the target of the
   JavaH Builder:
      classes = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src/pkg/sub')
      JavaH(target = File('native.h'), source = classes)

   Because SCons assumes by default that the target of the JavaH builder
   is a directory, you need to use the File function to make sure that
   SCons doesn't create a directory named native.h. When a file is used,
   though, SCons correctly converts the file name into the javah -o
   option:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg
/sub/Example2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
      javah -o native.h -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg
.sub.Example3
     __________________________________________________________________

25.5. Building RMI Stub and Skeleton Class Files: the RMIC Builder

   You can generate Remote Method Invocation stubs by using the [262]RMIC
   Builder. The source is a list of directories, typically returned by a
   call to the [263]Java Builder, and the target is an output directory
   where the _Stub.class and _Skel.class files will be placed:
      classes = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src/pkg/sub')
      RMIC(target = 'outdir', source = classes)

   As it did with the [264]JavaH Builder, SCons remembers the class
   directory and passes it as the -classpath option to rmic:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg
/sub/Example2.java
      rmic -d outdir -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2

   This example would generate the files
   outdir/pkg/sub/Example1_Skel.class, outdir/pkg/sub/Example1_Stub.class,
   outdir/pkg/sub/Example2_Skel.class and
   outdir/pkg/sub/Example2_Stub.class.

Chapter 26. Troubleshooting

   The experience of configuring any software build tool to build a large
   code base usually, at some point, involves trying to figure out why the
   tool is behaving a certain way, and how to get it to behave the way you
   want. SCons is no different. This appendix contains a number of
   different ways in which you can get some additional insight into SCons'
   behavior.

   Note that we're always interested in trying to improve how you can
   troubleshoot configuration problems. If you run into a problem that has
   you scratching your head, and which there just doesn't seem to be a
   good way to debug, odds are pretty good that someone else will run into
   the same problem, too. If so, please let the SCons development team
   know (preferably by filing a bug report or feature request at our
   project pages at tigris.org) so that we can use your feedback to try to
   come up with a better way to help you, and others, get the necessary
   insight into SCons behavior to help identify and fix configuration
   issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

26.1. Why is That Target Being Rebuilt? the --debug=explain Option

   Let's look at a simple example of a misconfigured build that causes a
   target to be rebuilt every time SCons is run:
      # Intentionally misspell the output file name in the
      # command used to create the file:
      Command('file.out', 'file.in', 'cp $SOURCE file.oout')

   (Note to Windows users: The POSIX cp command copies the first file
   named on the command line to the second file. In our example, it copies
   the file.in file to the file.out file.)

   Now if we run SCons multiple times on this example, we see that it
   re-runs the cp command every time:
      % scons -Q
      cp file.in file.oout
      % scons -Q
      cp file.in file.oout
      % scons -Q
      cp file.in file.oout

   In this example, the underlying cause is obvious: we've intentionally
   misspelled the output file name in the cp command, so the command
   doesn't actually build the file.out file that we've told SCons to
   expect. But if the problem weren't obvious, it would be helpful to
   specify the --debug=explain option on the command line to have SCons
   tell us very specifically why it's decided to rebuild the target:
      % scons -Q --debug=explain
      scons: building `file.out' because it doesn't exist
      cp file.in file.oout

   If this had been a more complicated example involving a lot of build
   output, having SCons tell us that it's trying to rebuild the target
   file because it doesn't exist would be an important clue that something
   was wrong with the command that we invoked to build it.

   The --debug=explain option also comes in handy to help figure out what
   input file changed. Given a simple configuration that builds a program
   from three source files, changing one of the source files and
   rebuilding with the --debug=explain option shows very specifically why
   SCons rebuilds the files that it does:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
      cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
      cc -o file3.o -c file3.c
      cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o
      % edit file2.c
          [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF file2.c]
      % scons -Q --debug=explain
      scons: rebuilding `file2.o' because `file2.c' changed
      cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
      scons: rebuilding `prog' because `file2.o' changed
      cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o

   This becomes even more helpful in identifying when a file is rebuilt
   due to a change in an implicit dependency, such as an incuded .h file.
   If the file1.c and file3.c files in our example both included a hello.h
   file, then changing that included file and re-running SCons with the
   --debug=explain option will pinpoint that it's the change to the
   included file that starts the chain of rebuilds:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o file1.o -c -I. file1.c
      cc -o file2.o -c -I. file2.c
      cc -o file3.o -c -I. file3.c
      cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o
      % edit hello.h
          [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
      % scons -Q --debug=explain
      scons: rebuilding `file1.o' because `hello.h' changed
      cc -o file1.o -c -I. file1.c
      scons: rebuilding `file3.o' because `hello.h' changed
      cc -o file3.o -c -I. file3.c
      scons: rebuilding `prog' because:
                 `file1.o' changed
                 `file3.o' changed
      cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o

   (Note that the --debug=explain option will only tell you why SCons
   decided to rebuild necessary targets. It does not tell you what files
   it examined when deciding not to rebuild a target file, which is often
   a more valuable question to answer.)
     __________________________________________________________________

26.2. What's in That Construction Environment? the Dump Method

   When you create a construction environment, SCons populates it with
   construction variables that are set up for various compilers, linkers
   and utilities that it finds on your system. Although this is usually
   helpful and what you want, it might be frustrating if SCons doesn't set
   certain variables that you expect to be set. In situations like this,
   it's sometimes helpful to use the construction environment Dump method
   to print all or some of the construction variables. Note that the Dump
   method returns the representation of the variables in the environment
   for you to print (or otherwise manipulate):
         env = Environment()
         print env.Dump()

   On a POSIX system with gcc installed, this might generate:
      % scons

   The construction environments in these examples have actually been
   restricted to just gcc and Visual C++, respectively. In a real-life
   situation, the construction environments will likely contain a great
   many more variables. Also note that we've massaged the example output
   above to make the memory address of all objects a constant 0x700000. In
   reality, you would see a different hexadecimal number for each object.

   To make it easier to see just what you're interested in, the Dump
   method allows you to specify a specific constrcution variable that you
   want to disply. For example, it's not unusual to want to verify the
   external environment used to execute build commands, to make sure that
   the PATH and other environment variables are set up the way they should
   be. You can do this as follows:
         env = Environment()
         print env.Dump('ENV')

   Which might display the following when executed on a POSIX system:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      {'PATH': '/usr/local/bin:/opt/bin:/bin:/usr/bin'}
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      scons: `.' is up to date.
      scons: done building targets.

   And the following when executed on a Windows system:
      C:\>scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      { 'INCLUDE': 'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio/VC98\\include',

26.3. What Dependencies Does SCons Know About? the --tree Option

   Sometimes the best way to try to figure out what SCons is doing is
   simply to take a look at the dependency graph that it constructs based
   on your SConscript files. The --tree option will display all or part of
   the SCons dependency graph in an "ASCII art" graphical format that
   shows the dependency hierarchy.

   For example, given the following input SConstruct file:
         env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
         env.Program('prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   Running SCons with the --tree=all option yields:
      % scons -Q --tree=all
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
      +-.
        +-SConstruct
        +-f1.c
        +-f1.o
        | +-f1.c
        | +-inc.h
        +-f2.c
        +-f2.o
        | +-f2.c
        | +-inc.h
        +-f3.c
        +-f3.o
        | +-f3.c
        | +-inc.h
        +-inc.h
        +-prog
          +-f1.o
          | +-f1.c
          | +-inc.h
          +-f2.o
          | +-f2.c
          | +-inc.h
          +-f3.o
            +-f3.c
            +-inc.h

   The tree will also be printed when the -n (no execute) option is used,
   which allows you to examine the dependency graph for a configuration
   without actually rebuilding anything in the tree.

   The --tree option only prints the dependency graph for the specified
   targets (or the default target(s) if none are specified on the command
   line). So if you specify a target like f2.o on the command line, the
   --tree option will only print the dependency graph for that file:
      % scons -Q --tree=all f2.o
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      +-f2.o
        +-f2.c
        +-inc.h

   This is, of course, useful for restricting the output from a very large
   build configuration to just a portion in which you're interested.
   Multiple targets are fine, in which case a tree will be printed for
   each specified target:
      % scons -Q --tree=all f1.o f3.o
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      +-f1.o
        +-f1.c
        +-inc.h
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      +-f3.o
        +-f3.c
        +-inc.h

   The status argument may be used to tell SCons to print status
   information about each file in the dependency graph:
      % scons -Q --tree=status
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
       E         = exists
        R        = exists in repository only
         b       = implicit builder
         B       = explicit builder
          S      = side effect
           P     = precious
            A    = always build
             C   = current
              N  = no clean
               H = no cache

      [E b      ]+-.
      [E     C  ]  +-SConstruct
      [E     C  ]  +-f1.c
      [E B   C  ]  +-f1.o
      [E     C  ]  | +-f1.c
      [E     C  ]  | +-inc.h
      [E     C  ]  +-f2.c
      [E B   C  ]  +-f2.o
      [E     C  ]  | +-f2.c
      [E     C  ]  | +-inc.h
      [E     C  ]  +-f3.c
      [E B   C  ]  +-f3.o
      [E     C  ]  | +-f3.c
      [E     C  ]  | +-inc.h
      [E     C  ]  +-inc.h
      [E B   C  ]  +-prog
      [E B   C  ]    +-f1.o
      [E     C  ]    | +-f1.c
      [E     C  ]    | +-inc.h
      [E B   C  ]    +-f2.o
      [E     C  ]    | +-f2.c
      [E     C  ]    | +-inc.h
      [E B   C  ]    +-f3.o
      [E     C  ]      +-f3.c
      [E     C  ]      +-inc.h

   Note that --tree=all,status is equivalent; the all is assumed if only
   status is present. As an alternative to all, you can specify
   --tree=derived to have SCons only print derived targets in the tree
   output, skipping source files (like .c and .h files):
      % scons -Q --tree=derived
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
      +-.
        +-f1.o
        +-f2.o
        +-f3.o
        +-prog
          +-f1.o
          +-f2.o
          +-f3.o

   You can use the status modifier with derived as well:
      % scons -Q --tree=derived,status
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
       E         = exists
        R        = exists in repository only
         b       = implicit builder
         B       = explicit builder
          S      = side effect
           P     = precious
            A    = always build
             C   = current
              N  = no clean
               H = no cache

      [E b      ]+-.
      [E B   C  ]  +-f1.o
      [E B   C  ]  +-f2.o
      [E B   C  ]  +-f3.o
      [E B   C  ]  +-prog
      [E B   C  ]    +-f1.o
      [E B   C  ]    +-f2.o
      [E B   C  ]    +-f3.o

   Note that the order of the --tree= arguments doesn't matter;
   --tree=status,derived is completely equivalent.

   The default behavior of the --tree option is to repeat all of the
   dependencies each time the library dependency (or any other dependency
   file) is encountered in the tree. If certain target files share other
   target files, such as two programs that use the same library:
         env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'],
                           LIBS = ['foo'],
                           LIBPATH = ['.'])
         env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
         env.Program('prog1.c')
         env.Program('prog2.c')

   Then there can be a lot of repetition in the --tree= output:
      % scons -Q --tree=all
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
      ranlib libfoo.a
      cc -o prog1.o -c -I. prog1.c
      cc -o prog1 prog1.o -L. -lfoo
      cc -o prog2.o -c -I. prog2.c
      cc -o prog2 prog2.o -L. -lfoo
      +-.
        +-SConstruct
        +-f1.c
        +-f1.o

        +-prog2.o
          +-prog2.c
          +-inc.h

   In a large configuration with many internal libraries and include
   files, this can very quickly lead to huge output trees. To help make
   this more manageable, a prune modifier may be added to the option list,
   in which case SCons will print the name of a target that has already
   been visited during the tree-printing in [square brackets] as an
   indication that the dependencies of the target file may be found by
   looking farther up the tree:
      % scons -Q --tree=prune
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
      ranlib libfoo.a
      cc -o prog1.o -c -I. prog1.c
      cc -o prog1 prog1.o -L. -lfoo
      cc -o prog2.o -c -I. prog2.c
      cc -o prog2 prog2.o -L. -lfoo
      +-.
        +-SConstruct
        +-f1.c
        +-f1.o
        | +-f1.c
        | +-inc.h
        +-f2.c
        +-f2.o
        | +-f2.c
        | +-inc.h
        +-f3.c
        +-f3.o
        | +-f3.c
        | +-inc.h
        +-inc.h
        +-libfoo.a
        | +-[f1.o]
        | +-[f2.o]
        | +-[f3.o]
        +-prog1
        | +-prog1.o
        | | +-prog1.c
        | | +-inc.h
        | +-[libfoo.a]
        +-prog1.c
        +-[prog1.o]
        +-prog2
        | +-prog2.o
        | | +-prog2.c
        | | +-inc.h
        | +-[libfoo.a]
        +-prog2.c
        +-[prog2.o]

   Like the status keyword, the prune argument by itself is equivalent to
   --tree=all,prune.

26.4. How is SCons Constructing the Command Lines It Executes? the
--debug=presub Option

   Sometimes it's useful to look at the pre-substitution string that SCons
   uses to generate the command lines it executes. This can be done with
   the --debug=presub option:
      % scons -Q --debug=presub
      Building prog.o with action:
        $CC -o $TARGET -c $CFLAGS $CCFLAGS $_CCOMCOM $SOURCES
      cc -o prog.o -c -I. prog.c
      Building prog with action:
        $SMART_LINKCOM
      cc -o prog prog.o
     __________________________________________________________________

26.5. Where is SCons Searching for Libraries? the --debug=findlibs Option

   To get some insight into what library names SCons is searching for, and
   in which directories it is searching, Use the --debug=findlibs option.
   Given the following input SConstruct file:
        env = Environment(LIBPATH = ['libs1', 'libs2'])
        env.Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo', 'bar'])

   And the libraries libfoo.a and libbar.a in libs1 and libs2,
   respectively, use of the --debug=findlibs option yields:
      % scons -Q --debug=findlibs
        findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.a' in 'libs1' ...
        findlibs: ... FOUND 'libfoo.a' in 'libs1'
        findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.so' in 'libs1' ...
        findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.so' in 'libs2' ...
        findlibs: looking for 'libbar.a' in 'libs1' ...
        findlibs: looking for 'libbar.a' in 'libs2' ...
        findlibs: ... FOUND 'libbar.a' in 'libs2'
        findlibs: looking for 'libbar.so' in 'libs1' ...
        findlibs: looking for 'libbar.so' in 'libs2' ...
      cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
      cc -o prog prog.o -Llibs1 -Llibs2 -lfoo -lbar
     __________________________________________________________________

26.6. Where is SCons Blowing Up? the --debug=stacktrace Option

   In general, SCons tries to keep its error messages short and
   informative. That means we usually try to avoid showing the stack
   traces that are familiar to experienced Python programmers, since they
   usually contain much more information than is useful to most people.

   For example, the following SConstruct file:
         Program('prog.c')

   Generates the following error if the prog.c file does not exist:
      % scons -Q
      scons: *** Source `prog.c' not found, needed by target `prog.o'.  Stop.

   In this case, the error is pretty obvious. But if it weren't, and you
   wanted to try to get more information about the error, the
   --debug=stacktrace option would show you exactly where in the SCons
   source code the problem occurs:
      % scons -Q --debug=stacktrace
      scons: *** Source `prog.c' not found, needed by target `prog.o'.  Stop.
      scons: internal stack trace:
        File "bootstrap/src/engine/SCons/Job.py", line 187, in start
        File "bootstrap/src/engine/SCons/Script/Main.py", line 169, in prepare
        File "bootstrap/src/engine/SCons/Taskmaster.py", line 184, in prepare
        File "bootstrap/src/engine/SCons/Executor.py", line 171, in prepare

   Of course, if you do need to dive into the SCons source code, we'd like
   to know if, or how, the error messages or troubleshooting options could
   have been improved to avoid that. Not everyone has the necessary time
   or Python skill to dive into the source code, and we'd like to improve
   SCons for those people as well...
     __________________________________________________________________

26.7. How is SCons Making Its Decisions? the --taskmastertrace Option

   The internal SCons subsystem that handles walking the dependency graph
   and controls the decision-making about what to rebuild is the
   Taskmaster. SCons supports a --taskmastertrace option that tells the
   Taskmaster to print information about the children (dependencies) of
   the various Nodes on its walk down the graph, which specific dependent
   Nodes are being evaluated, and in what order.

   The --taskmastertrace option takes as an argument the name of a file in
   which to put the trace output, with - (a single hyphen) indicating that
   the trace messages should be printed to the standard output:
      env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
      env.Program('prog.c')

      % scons -Q --taskmastertrace=- prog

      Taskmaster: Looking for a node to evaluate
      Taskmaster:     Considering node <no_state   'prog'> and its children:
      Taskmaster:        <no_state   'prog.o'>
      Taskmaster:     Considering node <no_state   'prog.o'> and its children:
      Taskmaster:        <no_state   'prog.c'>
      Taskmaster:        <no_state   'inc.h'>
      Taskmaster:     Considering node <no_state   'prog.c'> and its children:
      Taskmaster: Evaluating <pending    'prog.c'>

      Taskmaster: Looking for a node to evaluate
      Taskmaster:     Considering node <no_state   'inc.h'> and its children:
      Taskmaster: Evaluating <pending    'inc.h'>

      Taskmaster: Looking for a node to evaluate
      Taskmaster:     Considering node <pending    'prog.o'> and its children:
      Taskmaster:        <up_to_date 'prog.c'>
      Taskmaster:        <up_to_date 'inc.h'>
      Taskmaster: Evaluating <pending    'prog.o'>
      cc -o prog.o -c -I. prog.c

      Taskmaster: Looking for a node to evaluate
      Taskmaster:     Considering node <pending    'prog'> and its children:
      Taskmaster:        <executed   'prog.o'>
      Taskmaster: Evaluating <pending    'prog'>
      cc -o prog prog.o

      Taskmaster: Looking for a node to evaluate
      Taskmaster: No candidate anymore.

   The --taskmastertrace option doesn't provide information about the
   actual calculations involved in deciding if a file is up-to-date, but
   it does show all of the dependencies it knows about for each Node, and
   the order in which those dependencies are evaluated. This can be useful
   as an alternate way to determine whether or not your SCons
   configuration, or the implicit dependency scan, has actually identified
   all the correct dependencies you want it to.

Appendix A. Construction Variables

   This appendix contains descriptions of all of the construction
   variables that are potentially available "out of the box" in this
   version of SCons. Whether or not setting a construction variable in a
   construction environment will actually have an effect depends on
   whether any of the Tools and/or Builders that use the variable have
   been included in the construction environment.

   In this appendix, we have appended the initial $ (dollar sign) to the
   beginning of each variable name when it appears in the text, but left
   off the dollar sign in the left-hand column where the name appears for
   each entry.

   AR
          The static library archiver.

   ARCHITECTURE
          Specifies the system architecture for which the package is being
          built. The default is the system architecture of the machine on
          which SCons is running. This is used to fill in the
          Architecture: field in an Ipkg control file, and as part of the
          name of a generated RPM file.

   ARCOM
          The command line used to generate a static library from object
          files.

   ARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file. If this is not set, then
          [265]$ARCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   ARFLAGS
          General options passed to the static library archiver.

   AS
          The assembler.

   ASCOM
          The command line used to generate an object file from an
          assembly-language source file.

   ASCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file. If this is not set, then
          [266]$ASCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

   ASFLAGS
          General options passed to the assembler.

   ASPPCOM
          The command line used to assemble an assembly-language source
          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. Any options specified in the [267]$ASFLAGS
          and [268]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line.

   ASPPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file after first running the file
          through the C preprocessor. If this is not set, then
          [269]$ASPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASPPCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

   ASPPFLAGS
          General options when an assembling an assembly-language source
          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. The default is to use the value of
          [270]$ASFLAGS.

   BIBTEX
          The bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter
          and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   BIBTEXCOM
          The command line used to call the bibliography generator for the
          TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter.

   BIBTEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a bibliography for TeX or
          LaTeX. If this is not set, then [271]$BIBTEXCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(BIBTEXCOMSTR = "Generating bibliography $TARGET")

   BIBTEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the bibliography generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   BITKEEPER
          The BitKeeper executable.

   BITKEEPERCOM
          The command line for fetching source files using BitKeeper.

   BITKEEPERCOMSTR
          The string displayed when fetching a source file using
          BitKeeper. If this is not set, then [272]$BITKEEPERCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   BITKEEPERGET
          The command ([273]$BITKEEPER) and subcommand for fetching source
          files using BitKeeper.

   BITKEEPERGETFLAGS
          Options that are passed to the BitKeeper get subcommand.

   BUILDERS
          A dictionary mapping the names of the builders available through
          this environment to underlying Builder objects. Builders named
          Alias, CFile, CXXFile, DVI, Library, Object, PDF, PostScript,
          and Program are available by default. If you initialize this
          variable when an Environment is created:

env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'NewBuilder' : foo})

          the default Builders will no longer be available. To use a new
          Builder object in addition to the default Builders, add your new
          Builder object like this:

env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'NewBuilder' : foo})

          or this:

env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS]['NewBuilder'] = foo

   CC
          The C compiler.

   CCCOM
          The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static)
          object file. Any options specified in the [274]$CFLAGS,
          [275]$CCFLAGS and [276]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are
          included on this command line.

   CCCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a C source file is compiled to a
          (static) object file. If this is not set, then [277]$CCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CCFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C and C++ compilers.

   CCPCHFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support building
          with precompiled headers. The default value expands expands to
          the appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options when
          the [278]$PCH construction variable is set.

   CCPDBFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support storing
          debugging information in a Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file. The
          default value expands expands to appropriate Microsoft Visual
          C++ command-line options when the [279]$PDB construction
          variable is set.

          The Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by default to
          generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with
          parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in
          the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single
          PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only
          way to get debug information embedded into a static library.
          Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance,
          although parallel builds will no longer work.

          You can generate PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the
          default [280]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

import SCons.Util
env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = SCons.Util.CLVar(['${(PDB and "/Zi /Fd%s" % File(PDB)) or ""
}'])

          An alternative would be to use the /Zi to put the debugging
          information in a separate .pdb file for each object file by
          overriding the [281]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = '/Zi /Fd${TARGET}.pdb'

   CCVERSION
          The version number of the C compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C compiler being used.

   CFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C source files. This is used by the internal
          CFile builder when generating C files from Lex (.l) or YACC (.y)
          input files. The default suffix, of course, is .c (lower case).
          On case-insensitive systems (like Windows), SCons also treats .C
          (upper case) files as C files.

   CFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C compiler (C only; not
          C++).

   CHANGE_SPECFILE
          A hook for modifying the file that controls the packaging build
          (the .spec for RPM, the control for Ipkg, the .wxs for MSI). If
          set, the function will be called after the SCons template for
          the file has been written. XXX

   CHANGELOG
          The name of a file containing the change log text to be included
          in the package. This is included as the %changelog section of
          the RPM .spec file.

   _concat
          A function used to produce variables like $_CPPINCFLAGS. It
          takes four or five arguments: a prefix to concatenate onto each
          element, a list of elements, a suffix to concatenate onto each
          element, an environment for variable interpolation, and an
          optional function that will be called to transform the list
          before concatenation.

env['_CPPINCFLAGS'] = '$( ${_concat(INCPREFIX, CPPPATH, INCSUFFIX, __env__, RDir
s)} $)',

   CONFIGUREDIR
          The name of the directory in which Configure context test files
          are written. The default is .sconf_temp in the top-level
          directory containing the SConstruct file.

   CONFIGURELOG
          The name of the Configure context log file. The default is
          config.log in the top-level directory containing the SConstruct
          file.

   _CPPDEFFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options to define values. The value
          of $_CPPDEFFLAGS is created by appending $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $CPPDEFINES.

   CPPDEFINES
          A platform independent specification of C preprocessor
          definitions. The definitions will be added to command lines
          through the automatically-generated $_CPPDEFFLAGS construction
          variable (see above), which is constructed according to the type
          of value of $CPPDEFINES:

          If $CPPDEFINES is a string, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be added to the
          beginning and end.

# Will add -Dxyz to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /Dxyz to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES='xyz')

          If $CPPDEFINES is a list, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be appended to the
          beginning and end of each element in the list. If any element is
          a list or tuple, then the first item is the name being defined
          and the second item is its value:

# Will add -DB=2 -DA to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DB=2 /DA to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('B', 2), 'A'])

          If $CPPDEFINES is a dictionary, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX
          and $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be appended to the
          beginning and end of each item from the dictionary. The key of
          each dictionary item is a name being defined to the dictionary
          item's corresponding value; if the value is None, then the name
          is defined without an explicit value. Note that the resulting
          flags are sorted by keyword to ensure that the order of the
          options on the command line is consistent each time scons is
          run.

# Will add -DA -DB=2 to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DA /DB=2 to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES={'B':2, 'A':None})

   CPPDEFPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify preprocessor definitions on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the beginning of
          each definition in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable when
          the $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPDEFSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify preprocessor definitions on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          definition in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable when the
          $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPFLAGS
          User-specified C preprocessor options. These will be included in
          any command that uses the C preprocessor, including not just
          compilation of C and C++ source files via the [282]$CCCOM,
          [283]$SHCCCOM, [284]$CXXCOM and [285]$SHCXXCOM command lines,
          but also the [286]$FORTRANPPCOM, [287]$SHFORTRANPPCOM,
          [288]$F77PPCOM and [289]$SHF77PPCOM command lines used to
          compile a Fortran source file, and the [290]$ASPPCOM command
          line used to assemble an assembly language source file, after
          first running each file through the C preprocessor. Note that
          this variable does not contain -I (or similar) include search
          path options that scons generates automatically from
          [291]$CPPPATH. See [292]$_CPPINCFLAGS, below, for the variable
          that expands to those options.

   _CPPINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files. The value of $_CPPINCFLAGS is
          created by appending $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX to the beginning
          and end of each directory in $CPPPATH.

   CPPPATH
          The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for
          include directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in CCFLAGS or CXXFLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          CPPPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory
          when they are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a
          directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(CPPPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(CPPPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_CPPINCFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by appending the values of the $INCPREFIX
          and $INCSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end
          of each directory in $CPPPATH. Any command lines you define that
          need the CPPPATH directory list should include $_CPPINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(CCCOM="my_compiler $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   CPPSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for C
          preprocessor implicit dependencies (#include lines). The default
          list is:

[".c", ".C", ".cxx", ".cpp", ".c++", ".cc",
 ".h", ".H", ".hxx", ".hpp", ".hh",
 ".F", ".fpp", ".FPP",
 ".m", ".mm",
 ".S", ".spp", ".SPP"]

   CVS
          The CVS executable.

   CVSCOFLAGS
          Options that are passed to the CVS checkout subcommand.

   CVSCOM
          The command line used to fetch source files from a CVS
          repository.

   CVSCOMSTR
          The string displayed when fetching a source file from a CVS
          repository. If this is not set, then [293]$CVSCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

   CVSFLAGS
          General options that are passed to CVS. By default, this is set
          to -d $CVSREPOSITORY to specify from where the files must be
          fetched.

   CVSREPOSITORY
          The path to the CVS repository. This is referenced in the
          default [294]$CVSFLAGS value.

   CXX
          The C++ compiler.

   CXXCOM
          The command line used to compile a C++ source file to an object
          file. Any options specified in the [295]$CXXFLAGS and
          [296]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line.

   CXXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a C++ source file is compiled to a
          (static) object file. If this is not set, then [297]$CXXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(CXXCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C++ source files. This is used by the internal
          CXXFile builder when generating C++ files from Lex (.ll) or YACC
          (.yy) input files. The default suffix is .cc. SCons also treats
          files with the suffixes .cpp, .cxx, .c++, and .C++ as C++ files,
          and files with .mm suffixes as Objective C++ files. On
          case-sensitive systems (Linux, UNIX, and other POSIX-alikes),
          SCons also treats .C (upper case) files as C++ files.

   CXXFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C++ compiler. By default,
          this includes the value of [298]$CCFLAGS, so that setting
          $CCFLAGS affects both C and C++ compilation. If you want to add
          C++-specific flags, you must set or override the value of
          [299]$CXXFLAGS.

   CXXVERSION
          The version number of the C++ compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C++ compiler being used.

   DESCRIPTION
          A long description of the project being packaged. This is
          included in the relevant section of the file that controls the
          packaging build.

   DESCRIPTION_lang
          A language-specific long description for the specified lang.
          This is used to populate a %description -l section of an RPM
          .spec file.

   Dir
          A function that converts a string into a Dir instance relative
          to the target being built.

   Dirs
          A function that converts a list of strings into a list of Dir
          instances relative to the target being built.

   DSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for imported
          D package files. The default list is:

['.d']

   DVIPDF
          The TeX DVI file to PDF file converter.

   DVIPDFCOM
          The command line used to convert TeX DVI files into a PDF file.

   DVIPDFCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a TeX DVI file is converted into a PDF
          file. If this is not set, then [300]$DVIPDFCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

   DVIPDFFLAGS
          General options passed to the TeX DVI file to PDF file
          converter.

   DVIPS
          The TeX DVI file to PostScript converter.

   DVIPSFLAGS
          General options passed to the TeX DVI file to PostScript
          converter.

   ENV
          A dictionary of environment variables to use when invoking
          commands. When $ENV is used in a command all list values will be
          joined using the path separator and any other non-string values
          will simply be coerced to a string. Note that, by default, scons
          does not propagate the environment in force when you execute
          scons to the commands used to build target files. This is so
          that builds will be guaranteed repeatable regardless of the
          environment variables set at the time scons is invoked.

          If you want to propagate your environment variables to the
          commands executed to build target files, you must do so
          explicitly:

import os
env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)

          Note that you can choose only to propagate certain environment
          variables. A common example is the system PATH environment
          variable, so that scons uses the same utilities as the invoking
          shell (or other process):

import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})

   ESCAPE
          A function that will be called to escape shell special
          characters in command lines. The function should take one
          argument: the command line string to escape; and should return
          the escaped command line.

   F77
          The Fortran 77 compiler. You should normally set the
          [301]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [302]$F77 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 77 files.

   F77COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 77 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [303]$F77COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 77 files. You should
          normally set the [304]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F77COMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 77 source file is compiled
          to an object file. If this is not set, then [305]$F77COM or
          [306]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F77FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F77 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f77']

   F77FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 77
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [307]$F77PATH. See [308]$_F77INCFLAGS below,
          for the variable that expands to those options. You only need to
          set [309]$F77FLAGS if you need to define specific user options
          for Fortran 77 files. You should normally set the
          [310]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F77INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 77 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [311]$_F77INCFLAGS is created by appending [312]$INCPREFIX and
          [313]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [314]$F77PATH.

   F77PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 77 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [315]$F77FLAGS because the result
          will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by
          the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in [316]$F77PATH
          will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they
          are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #: You only need to
          set [317]$F77PATH if you need to define a specific include path
          for Fortran 77 files. You should normally set the
          [318]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include path for
          the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F77PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F77PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [319]$_F77INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [320]$INCPREFIX and [321]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [322]$F77PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F77PATH directory list
          should include [323]$_F77INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F77COM="my_compiler $_F77INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F77PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 77 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [324]$F77FLAGS and
          [325]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [326]$F77PPCOM if you need to
          use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 77 files.
          You should normally set the [327]$FORTRANPPCOM variable, which
          specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F77PPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 77 source file is compiled
          to an object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [328]$F77PPCOM or
          [329]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F77PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F77 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty

   F90
          The Fortran 90 compiler. You should normally set the
          [330]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [331]$F90 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 90 files.

   F90COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 90 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [332]$F90COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 90 files. You should
          normally set the [333]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F90COMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 90 source file is compiled
          to an object file. If this is not set, then [334]$F90COM or
          [335]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F90FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F90 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f90']

   F90FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 90
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [336]$F90PATH. See [337]$_F90INCFLAGS below,
          for the variable that expands to those options. You only need to
          set [338]$F90FLAGS if you need to define specific user options
          for Fortran 90 files. You should normally set the
          [339]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F90INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 90 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [340]$_F90INCFLAGS is created by appending [341]$INCPREFIX and
          [342]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [343]$F90PATH.

   F90PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 90 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [344]$F90FLAGS because the result
          will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by
          the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in [345]$F90PATH
          will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they
          are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #: You only need to
          set [346]$F90PATH if you need to define a specific include path
          for Fortran 90 files. You should normally set the
          [347]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include path for
          the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F90PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F90PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [348]$_F90INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [349]$INCPREFIX and [350]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [351]$F90PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F90PATH directory list
          should include [352]$_F90INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F90COM="my_compiler $_F90INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F90PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 90 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [353]$F90FLAGS and
          [354]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [355]$F90PPCOM if you need to
          use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 90 files.
          You should normally set the [356]$FORTRANPPCOM variable, which
          specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F90PPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 90 source file is compiled
          after first running the file through the C preprocessor. If this
          is not set, then [357]$F90PPCOM or [358]$FORTRANPPCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   F90PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F90 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty

   F95
          The Fortran 95 compiler. You should normally set the
          [359]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [360]$F95 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 95 files.

   F95COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 95 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [361]$F95COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 95 files. You should
          normally set the [362]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F95COMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is compiled
          to an object file. If this is not set, then [363]$F95COM or
          [364]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F95FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F95 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f95']

   F95FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 95
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [365]$F95PATH. See [366]$_F95INCFLAGS below,
          for the variable that expands to those options. You only need to
          set [367]$F95FLAGS if you need to define specific user options
          for Fortran 95 files. You should normally set the
          [368]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F95INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 95 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [369]$_F95INCFLAGS is created by appending [370]$INCPREFIX and
          [371]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [372]$F95PATH.

   F95PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 95 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [373]$F95FLAGS because the result
          will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by
          the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in [374]$F95PATH
          will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they
          are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #: You only need to
          set [375]$F95PATH if you need to define a specific include path
          for Fortran 95 files. You should normally set the
          [376]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include path for
          the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F95PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F95PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [377]$_F95INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [378]$INCPREFIX and [379]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [380]$F95PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F95PATH directory list
          should include [381]$_F95INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F95COM="my_compiler $_F95INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F95PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 95 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [382]$F95FLAGS and
          [383]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [384]$F95PPCOM if you need to
          use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 95 files.
          You should normally set the [385]$FORTRANPPCOM variable, which
          specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F95PPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is compiled
          to an object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [386]$F95PPCOM or
          [387]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F95PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F95 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty

          to the target being built.

   FORTRAN
          The default Fortran compiler for all versions of Fortran.

   FORTRANCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file. By default, any options specified in the
          [388]$FORTRANFLAGS, [389]$CPPFLAGS, [390]$_CPPDEFFLAGS,
          [391]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and [392]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variables are included on this command line.

   FORTRANCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran source file is compiled to
          an object file. If this is not set, then [393]$FORTRANCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the FORTRAN dialect will
          be used. By default, this is ['.f', '.for', '.ftn']

   FORTRANFLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include or module search path options that scons
          generates automatically from [394]$FORTRANPATH. See
          [395]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS and [396]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, below, for the
          variables that expand those options.

   _FORTRANINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files and module files. The value of
          [397]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS is created by prepending/appending
          [398]$INCPREFIX and [399]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of
          each directory in [400]$FORTRANPATH.

   FORTRANMODDIR
          Directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files it generates. This variable is empty, by default.
          Some Fortran compilers will internally append this directory in
          the search path for module files, as well.

   FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the beginning of
          the directory in the [401]$FORTRANMODDIR construction variables
          when the [402]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is automatically
          generated.

   FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the beginning of
          the directory in the [403]$FORTRANMODDIR construction variables
          when the [404]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is automatically
          generated.

   _FORTRANMODFLAG
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line option for specifying the
          directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files that happen to get generated during compilation.
          The value of [405]$_FORTRANMODFLAG is created by
          prepending/appending [406]$FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX and
          [407]$FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and end of the
          directory in [408]$FORTRANMODDIR.

   FORTRANMODPREFIX
          The module file prefix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is left empty, by default. For situations
          in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal
          convention, the user may use this variable. Its value will be
          appended to every module file name as scons attempts to resolve
          dependencies.

   FORTRANMODSUFFIX
          The module file suffix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is set to ".mod", by default. For
          situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the
          normal convention, the user may use this variable. Its value
          will be appended to every module file name as scons attempts to
          resolve dependencies.

   FORTRANPATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran compiler will search
          for include files and (for some compilers) module files. The
          Fortran implicit dependency scanner will search these
          directories for include files (but not module files since they
          are autogenerated and, as such, may not actually exist at the
          time the scan takes place). Don't explicitly put include
          directory arguments in FORTRANFLAGS because the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. Note: directory names in FORTRANPATH will be
          looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are
          used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(FORTRANPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(FORTRANPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [409]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [410]$INCPREFIX and [411]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [412]$FORTRANPATH.
          Any command lines you define that need the FORTRANPATH directory
          list should include [413]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(FORTRANCOM="my_compiler $_FORTRANINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURC
E")

   FORTRANPPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. By default, any options specified in the
          [414]$FORTRANFLAGS, [415]$CPPFLAGS, [416]$_CPPDEFFLAGS,
          [417]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and [418]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variables are included on this command line.

   FORTRANPPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran source file is compiled to
          an object file after first running the file throught the C
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [419]$FORTRANPPCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANPPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for FORTRAN dialect will be used. By default,
          this is ['.fpp', '.FPP']

   FORTRANSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for Fortran
          implicit dependencies (INCLUDE lines and USE statements). The
          default list is:

[".f", ".F", ".for", ".FOR", ".ftn", ".FTN", ".fpp", ".FPP",
".f77", ".F77", ".f90", ".F90", ".f95", ".F95"]

   FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list containing the paths to search for
          frameworks. Used by the compiler to find framework-style
          includes like #include <Fmwk/Header.h>. Used by the linker to
          find user-specified frameworks when linking (see
          [420]$FRAMEWORKS). For example:

 env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKPATH='#myframeworkdir')

          will add

  ... -Fmyframeworkdir

          to the compiler and linker command lines.

   _FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options
          corresponding to [421]$FRAMEWORKPATH.

   FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for the
          FRAMEWORKPATH entries. (see [422]$FRAMEWORKPATH). The default
          value is -F.

   FRAMEWORKPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for linking in
          frameworks (see [423]$FRAMEWORKS). The default value is
          -framework.

   _FRAMEWORKS

          variable containing the linker command-line options for linking
          with FRAMEWORKS.

   FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list of the framework names to be linked
          into a program or shared library or bundle. The default value is
          the empty list. For example:

 env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKS=Split('System Cocoa SystemConfiguration'))

   FRAMEWORKSFLAGS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, general user-supplied frameworks options
          to be added at the end of a command line building a loadable
          module. (This has been largely superceded by the
          [424]$FRAMEWORKPATH, [425]$FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX,
          [426]$FRAMEWORKPREFIX and [427]$FRAMEWORKS variables described
          above.)

   GS
          The Ghostscript program used to convert PostScript to PDF files.

   GSCOM
          The Ghostscript command line used to convert PostScript to PDF
          files.

   GSCOMSTR
          The string displayed when Ghostscript is used to convert a
          PostScript file to a PDF file. If this is not set, then
          [428]$GSCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   GSFLAGS
          General options passed to the Ghostscript program when
          converting PostScript to PDF files.

   IDLSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for IDL
          implicit dependencies (#include or import lines). The default
          list is:

[".idl", ".IDL"]

   IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES
          Controls whether or not SCons will add implicit dependencies for
          the commands executed to build targets.

          By default, SCons will add to each target an implicit dependency
          on the command represented by the first argument on any command
          line it executes. The specific file for the dependency is found
          by searching the PATH variable in the ENV environment used to
          execute the command.

          If the construction variable $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is
          set to a false value (None, False, 0, etc.), then the implicit
          dependency will not be added to the targets built with that
          construction environment.

env = Environment(IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES = 0)

   INCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the beginning of
          each directory in the $CPPPATH and $FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the $_CPPINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables
          are automatically generated.

   INCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          directory in the $CPPPATH and $FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the $_CPPINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables
          are automatically generated.

   INSTALL
          A function to be called to install a file into a destination
          file name. The default function copies the file into the
          destination (and sets the destination file's mode and permission
          bits to match the source file's). The function takes the
          following arguments:

def install(dest, source, env):

          dest is the path name of the destination file. source is the
          path name of the source file. env is the construction
          environment (a dictionary of construction values) in force for
          this file installation.

   INSTALLSTR
          The string displayed when a file is installed into a destination
          file name. The default is:

Install file: "$SOURCE" as "$TARGET"

   INTEL_C_COMPILER_VERSION
          Set by the "intelc" Tool to the major version number of the
          Intel C compiler selected for use.

   JAR
          The Java archive tool.

   JARCHDIR
          The directory to which the Java archive tool should change
          (using the -C option).

   JARCOM
          The command line used to call the Java archive tool.

   JARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when the Java archive tool is called If
          this is not set, then $JARCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JARCOMSTR = "JARchiving $SOURCES into $TARGET")

   JARFLAGS
          General options passed to the Java archive tool. By default this
          is set to cf to create the necessary jar file.

   JARSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java archives: .jar by default.

   JAVABOOTCLASSPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be added to the
          javac command line via the -bootclasspath option. The individual
          directory names will be separated by the operating system's path
          separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on Windows).

   JAVAC
          The Java compiler.

   JAVACCOM
          The command line used to compile a directory tree containing
          Java source files to corresponding Java class files. Any options
          specified in the [429]$JAVACFLAGS construction variable are
          included on this command line.

   JAVACCOMSTR
          The string displayed when compiling a directory tree of Java
          source files to corresponding Java class files. If this is not
          set, then [430]$JAVACCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVACCOMSTR = "Compiling class files $TARGETS from $SOURCES")

   JAVACFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the Java compiler.

   JAVACLASSDIR
          The directory in which Java class files may be found. This is
          stripped from the beginning of any Java .class file names
          supplied to the JavaH builder.

   JAVACLASSPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for Java
          .class file. The directories in this list will be added to the
          javac and javah command lines via the -classpath option. The
          individual directory names will be separated by the operating
          system's path separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on
          Windows).

          Note that this currently just adds the specified directory via
          the -classpath option. SCons does not currently search the
          $JAVACLASSPATH directories for dependency .class files.

   JAVACLASSSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java class files; .class by default.

   JAVAH
          The Java generator for C header and stub files.

   JAVAHCOM
          The command line used to generate C header and stub files from
          Java classes. Any options specified in the [431]$JAVAHFLAGS
          construction variable are included on this command line.

   JAVAHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when C header and stub files are generated
          from Java classes. If this is not set, then [432]$JAVAHCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVAHCOMSTR = "Generating header/stub file(s) $TARGETS from $S
OURCES")

   JAVAHFLAGS
          General options passed to the C header and stub file generator
          for Java classes.

   JAVASOURCEPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for
          input .java file. The directories in this list will be added to
          the javac command line via the -sourcepath option. The
          individual directory names will be separated by the operating
          system's path separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on
          Windows).

          Note that this currently just adds the specified directory via
          the -sourcepath option. SCons does not currently search the
          $JAVASOURCEPATH directories for dependency .java files.

   JAVASUFFIX
          The suffix for Java files; .java by default.

   JAVAVERSION
          Specifies the Java version being used by the Java builder. This
          is not currently used to select one version of the Java compiler
          vs. another. Instead, you should set this to specify the version
          of Java supported by your javac compiler. The default is 1.4.

          This is sometimes necessary because Java 1.5 changed the file
          names that are created for nested anonymous inner classes, which
          can cause a mismatch with the files that SCons expects will be
          generated by the javac compiler. Setting $JAVAVERSION to 1.5 (or
          1.6, as appropriate) can make SCons realize that a Java 1.5 or
          1.6 build is actually up to date.

   LATEX
          The LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   LATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter. If this is not set, then [433]$LATEXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LATEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES")

   LATEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXRETRIES
          The maximum number of times that LaTeX will be re-run if the
          .log generated by the [434]$LATEXCOM command indicates that
          there are undefined references. The default is to try to resolve
          undefined references by re-running LaTeX up to three times.

   LATEXSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for LaTeX
          implicit dependencies (\include or \import files). The default
          list is:

[".tex", ".ltx", ".latex"]

   LDMODULE
          The linker for building loadable modules. By default, this is
          the same as [435]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOM
          The command line for building loadable modules. On Mac OS X,
          this uses the [436]$LDMODULE, [437]$LDMODULEFLAGS and
          [438]$FRAMEWORKSFLAGS variables. On other systems, this is the
          same as [439]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOMSTR
          The string displayed when building loadable modules. If this is
          not set, then [440]$LDMODULECOM (the command line) is displayed.

   LDMODULEFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker for building loadable
          modules.

   LDMODULEPREFIX
          The prefix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          [441]$SHLIBPREFIX.

   LDMODULESUFFIX
          The suffix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          $SHLIBSUFFIX.

   LEX
          The lexical analyzer generator.

   LEXCOM
          The command line used to call the lexical analyzer generator to
          generate a source file.

   LEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          lexical analyzer generator. If this is not set, then
          [442]$LEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LEXCOMSTR = "Lex'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   LEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the lexical analyzer generator.

   _LIBDIRFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for library. The value of $_LIBDIRFLAGS is created by
          appending $LIBDIRPREFIX and $LIBDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and
          end of each directory in $LIBPATH.

   LIBDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the beginning of each
          directory in the $LIBPATH construction variable when the
          $_LIBDIRFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   LIBDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each directory
          in the $LIBPATH construction variable when the $_LIBDIRFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   _LIBFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying libraries to be
          linked with the resulting target. The value of $_LIBFLAGS is
          created by appending $LIBLINKPREFIX and $LIBLINKSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each filename in $LIBS.

   LIBLINKPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the beginning of each
          library in the $LIBS construction variable when the $_LIBFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBLINKSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each library
          in the $LIBS construction variable when the $_LIBFLAGS variable
          is automatically generated.

   LIBPATH
          The list of directories that will be searched for libraries. The
          implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for
          include files. Don't explicitly put include directory arguments
          in $LINKFLAGS or $SHLINKFLAGS because the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. Note: directory names in LIBPATH will be
          looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are
          used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(LIBPATH='#/libs')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

libs = Dir('libs')
env = Environment(LIBPATH=libs)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_LIBDIRFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by appending the values of the
          $LIBDIRPREFIX and $LIBDIRSUFFIX construction variables to the
          beginning and end of each directory in $LIBPATH. Any command
          lines you define that need the LIBPATH directory list should
          include $_LIBDIRFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

   LIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBPREFIXES
          A list of all legal prefixes for library file names. When
          searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files
          with these prefixes, the base library name, and suffixes in the
          $LIBSUFFIXES list.

   LIBS
          A list of one or more libraries that will be linked with any
          executable programs created by this environment.

          The library list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_LIBFLAGS construction variable, which
          is constructed by appending the values of the $LIBLINKPREFIX and
          $LIBLINKSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end
          of each filename in $LIBS. Any command lines you define that
          need the LIBS library list should include $_LIBFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

          If you add a File object to the $LIBS list, the name of that
          file will be added to $_LIBFLAGS, and thus the link line, as is,
          without $LIBLINKPREFIX or $LIBLINKSUFFIX. For example:

env.Append(LIBS=File('/tmp/mylib.so'))

          In all cases, scons will add dependencies from the executable
          program to all the libraries in this list.

   LIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBSUFFIXES
          A list of all legal suffixes for library file names. When
          searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files
          with prefixes, in the $LIBPREFIXES list, the base library name,
          and these suffixes.

   LICENSE
          The abbreviated name of the license under which this project is
          released (gpl, lpgl, bsd etc.). See
          http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical for a list of
          license names.

   LINK
          The linker.

   LINKCOM
          The command line used to link object files into an executable.

   LINKCOMSTR
          The string displayed when object files are linked into an
          executable. If this is not set, then [443]$LINKCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LINKCOMSTR = "Linking $TARGET")

   LINKFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker. Note that this
          variable should not contain -l (or similar) options for linking
          with the libraries listed in [444]$LIBS, nor -L (or similar)
          library search path options that scons generates automatically
          from [445]$LIBPATH. See [446]$_LIBFLAGS above, for the variable
          that expands to library-link options, and [447]$_LIBDIRFLAGS
          above, for the variable that expands to library search path
          options.

   M4
          The M4 macro preprocessor.

   M4COM
          The command line used to pass files through the M4 macro
          preprocessor.

   M4COMSTR
          The string displayed when a file is passed through the M4 macro
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [448]$M4COM (the command
          line) is displayed.

   M4FLAGS
          General options passed to the M4 macro preprocessor.

   MAKEINDEX
          The makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and
          the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   MAKEINDEXCOM
          The command line used to call the makeindex generator for the
          TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter.

   MAKEINDEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the makeindex generator for
          the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured
          formatter and typesetter. If this is not set, then
          [449]$MAKEINDEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   MAKEINDEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the makeindex generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   MAXLINELENGTH
          The maximum number of characters allowed on an external command
          line. On Win32 systems, link lines longer than this many
          characters are linked via a temporary file name.

   MIDL
          The Microsoft IDL compiler.

   MIDLCOM
          The command line used to pass files to the Microsoft IDL
          compiler.

   MIDLCOMSTR
          The string displayed when the Microsoft IDL copmiler is called.
          If this is not set, then [450]$MIDLCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   MIDLFLAGS
          General options passed to the Microsoft IDL compiler.

   MSVS
          When the Microsoft Visual Studio tools are initialized, they set
          up this dictionary with the following keys:

          VERSION: the version of MSVS being used (can be set via
          MSVS_VERSION)

          VERSIONS: the available versions of MSVS installed

          VCINSTALLDIR: installed directory of Visual C++

          VSINSTALLDIR: installed directory of Visual Studio

          FRAMEWORKDIR: installed directory of the .NET framework

          FRAMEWORKVERSIONS: list of installed versions of the .NET
          framework, sorted latest to oldest.

          FRAMEWORKVERSION: latest installed version of the .NET framework

          FRAMEWORKSDKDIR: installed location of the .NET SDK.

          PLATFORMSDKDIR: installed location of the Platform SDK.

          PLATFORMSDK_MODULES: dictionary of installed Platform SDK
          modules, where the dictionary keys are keywords for the various
          modules, and the values are 2-tuples where the first is the
          release date, and the second is the version number.

          If a value isn't set, it wasn't available in the registry.

   MSVS_IGNORE_IDE_PATHS
          Tells the MS Visual Studio tools to use minimal INCLUDE, LIB,
          and PATH settings, instead of the settings from the IDE.

          For Visual Studio, SCons will (by default) automatically
          determine where MSVS is installed, and use the LIB, INCLUDE, and
          PATH variables set by the IDE. You can override this behavior by
          setting these variables after Environment initialization, or by
          setting MSVS_IGNORE_IDE_PATHS = 1 in the Environment
          initialization. Specifying this will not leave these unset, but
          will set them to a minimal set of paths needed to run the tools
          successfully.

          For VS6, the mininimal set is:

   INCLUDE:'<VSDir>\VC98\ATL\include;<VSDir>\VC98\MFC\include;<VSDir>\VC98\inclu
de'
   LIB:'<VSDir>\VC98\MFC\lib;<VSDir>\VC98\lib'
   PATH:'<VSDir>\Common\MSDev98\bin;<VSDir>\VC98\bin'

          For VS7, it is:

   INCLUDE:'<VSDir>\Vc7\atlmfc\include;<VSDir>\Vc7\include'
   LIB:'<VSDir>\Vc7\atlmfc\lib;<VSDir>\Vc7\lib'
   PATH:'<VSDir>\Common7\Tools\bin;<VSDir>\Common7\Tools;<VSDir>\Vc7\bin'

          Where '<VSDir>' is the installed location of Visual Studio.

   MSVS_PROJECT_BASE_PATH
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          solution file as the value of the
          SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection0 and
          SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection1 attributes of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section. There is no default
          value.

   MSVS_PROJECT_GUID
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          file as the value of the ProjectGUID attribute. The string is
          also placed in the SolutionUniqueID attribute of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_SCC_AUX_PATH
          The path name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccAuxPath attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. There is no
          default value.

   MSVS_SCC_LOCAL_PATH
          The path name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccLocalPath attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. The path
          name is also placed in the SccLocalPath0 and SccLocalPath1
          attributes of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of
          the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. There is no default
          value.

   MSVS_SCC_PROJECT_NAME
          The project name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccProjectName attribute. There
          is no default value.

   MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          file as the value of the SccProvider attribute. The string is
          also placed in the SccProvider1 attribute of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS
          Tells the MS Visual Studio tool(s) to use the MFC directories in
          its default paths for compiling and linking. The
          $MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS variable has no effect if the INCLUDE or LIB
          environment variables are set explictly.

          Under Visual Studio version 6, setting $MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS to a
          non-zero value adds the ATL\include and MFC\include directories
          to the default INCLUDE external environment variable, and adds
          the MFC\lib directory to the default LIB external environment
          variable.

          Under Visual Studio version 7, setting $MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS to a
          non-zero value adds the atlmfc\include directory to the default
          INCLUDE external environment variable, and adds the atlmfc\lib
          directory to the default LIB external environment variable.

          Under Visual Studio version 8, setting $MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS to a
          non-zero value will, by default, add the atlmfc\include
          directory to the default INCLUDE external environment variable,
          and the atlmfc\lib directory to the default LIB external
          environment variable. If, however, the
          ['MSVS']['PLATFORMSDKDIR'] variable is set, then the mfc and the
          atl subdirectories of the PLATFORMSDKDIR are added to the
          default value of the INCLUDE external environment variable, and
          the default value of the LIB external environment variable is
          left untouched.

   MSVS_VERSION
          Sets the preferred version of MSVS to use.

          SCons will (by default) select the latest version of MSVS
          installed on your machine. So, if you have version 6 and version
          7 (MSVS .NET) installed, it will prefer version 7. You can
          override this by specifying the MSVS_VERSION variable in the
          Environment initialization, setting it to the appropriate
          version ('6.0' or '7.0', for example). If the given version
          isn't installed, tool initialization will fail.

   MSVSBUILDCOM
          The build command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified build targets.

   MSVSCLEANCOM
          The clean command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with the -c option to remove any specified targets.

   MSVSENCODING
          The encoding string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is encoding Windows-1252.

   MSVSPROJECTCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files.

   MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio project (DSP) files.
          The default value is .vcproj when using Visual Studio version
          7.x (.NET) or later version, and .dsp when using earlier
          versions of Visual Studio.

   MSVSREBUILDCOM
          The rebuild command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified rebuild targets.

   MSVSSCONS
          The SCons used in generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files. The default is the version of SCons being used to
          generate the project file.

   MSVSSCONSCOM
          The default SCons command used in generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project files.

   MSVSSCONSCRIPT
          The sconscript file (that is, SConstruct or SConscript file)
          that will be invoked by Visual Studio project files (through the
          [451]$MSVSSCONSCOM variable). The default is the same sconscript
          file that contains the call to MSVSProject to build the project
          file.

   MSVSSCONSFLAGS
          The SCons flags used in generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio solution
          files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio solution (DSW)
          files. The default value is .sln when using Visual Studio
          version 7.x (.NET), and .dsw when using earlier versions of
          Visual Studio.

   MWCW_VERSION
          The version number of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C compiler to
          be used.

   MWCW_VERSIONS
          A list of installed versions of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C
          compiler on this system.

   NAME
          Specfies the name of the project to package.

   no_import_lib
          When set to non-zero, suppresses creation of a corresponding
          Windows static import lib by the SharedLibrary builder when used
          with MinGW, Microsoft Visual Studio or Metrowerks. This also
          suppresses creation of an export (.exp) file when using
          Microsoft Visual Studio.

   OBJPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) object file names.

   P4COM
          The command line used to fetch source files from Perforce.

   P4COMSTR
          The string displayed when fetching a source file from Perforce.
          If this is not set, then [452]$P4COM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   P4FLAGS
          General options that are passed to Perforce.

   PACKAGEROOT
          Specifies the directory where all files in resulting archive
          will be placed if applicable. The default value is
          "$NAME-$VERSION".

   PACKAGETYPE
          Selects the package type to build. Currently these are
          available:

          * msi - Microsoft Installer * rpm - Redhat Package Manger * ipkg
          - Itsy Package Management System * tarbz2 - compressed tar *
          targz - compressed tar * zip - zip file * src_tarbz2 -
          compressed tar source * src_targz - compressed tar source *
          src_zip - zip file source

          This may be overridden with the "package_type" command line
          option.

   PACKAGEVERSION
          The version of the package (not the underlying project). This is
          currently only used by the rpm packager and should reflect
          changes in the packaging, not the underlying project code
          itself.

   PCH
          The Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header that will be used
          when compiling object files. This variable is ignored by tools
          other than Microsoft Visual C++. When this variable is defined
          SCons will add options to the compiler command line to cause it
          to use the precompiled header, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PCH file. Example:

env['PCH'] = 'StdAfx.pch'

   PCHCOM
          The command line used by the PCH builder to generated a
          precompiled header.

   PCHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a precompiled header. If
          this is not set, then [453]$PCHCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   PCHPDBFLAGS
          A construction variable that, when expanded, adds the /yD flag
          to the command line only if the $PDB construction variable is
          set.

   PCHSTOP
          This variable specifies how much of a source file is
          precompiled. This variable is ignored by tools other than
          Microsoft Visual C++, or when the PCH variable is not being
          used. When this variable is define it must be a string that is
          the name of the header that is included at the end of the
          precompiled portion of the source files, or the empty string if
          the "#pragma hrdstop" construct is being used:

env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'

   PDB
          The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging
          information for object files, shared libraries, and programs.
          This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual
          C++. When this variable is defined SCons will add options to the
          compiler and linker command line to cause them to generate
          external debugging information, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PDB file. Example:

env['PDB'] = 'hello.pdb'

          The Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default to
          generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with
          parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in
          the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single
          PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only
          way to get debug information embedded into a static library.
          Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance,
          although parallel builds will no longer work. You can generate
          PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the default
          [454]$CCPDBFLAGS variable; see the entry for that variable for
          specific examples.

   PDFCOM
          A deprecated synonym for [455]$DVIPDFCOM.

   PDFLATEX
          The pdflatex utility.

   PDFLATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the pdflatex utility.

   PDFLATEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the pdflatex utility. If this
          is not set, then [456]$PDFLATEXCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

env = Environment(PDFLATEX;COMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES"
)

   PDFLATEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the pdflatex utility.

   PDFPREFIX
          The prefix used for PDF file names.

   PDFSUFFIX
          The suffix used for PDF file names.

   PDFTEX
          The pdftex utility.

   PDFTEXCOM
          The command line used to call the pdftex utility.

   PDFTEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the pdftex utility. If this is
          not set, then [457]$PDFTEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(PDFTEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

   PDFTEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the pdftex utility.

   PKGCHK
          On Solaris systems, the package-checking program that will be
          used (along with $PKGINFO) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is /usr/sbin/pgkchk.

   PKGINFO
          On Solaris systems, the package information program that will be
          used (along with $PKGCHK) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is pkginfo.

   PLATFORM
          The name of the platform used to create the Environment. If no
          platform is specified when the Environment is created, scons
          autodetects the platform.

env = Environment(tools = [])
if env['PLATFORM'] == 'cygwin':
    Tool('mingw')(env)
else:
    Tool('msvc')(env)

   PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC
          A Python function used to print the command lines as they are
          executed (assuming command printing is not disabled by the -q or
          -s options or their equivalents). The function should take four
          arguments: s, the command being executed (a string), target, the
          target being built (file node, list, or string name(s)), source,
          the source(s) used (file node, list, or string name(s)), and
          env, the environment being used.

          The function must do the printing itself. The default
          implementation, used if this variable is not set or is None, is:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
  sys.stdout.write(s + "\n")

          Here's an example of a more interesting function:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
   sys.stdout.write("Building %s -> %s...\n" %
    (' and '.join([str(x) for x in source]),
     ' and '.join([str(x) for x in target])))
env=Environment(PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC=print_cmd_line)
env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

          This just prints "Building targetname from sourcename..."
          instead of the actual commands. Such a function could also log
          the actual commands to a log file, for example.

   PROGPREFIX
          The prefix used for executable file names.

   PROGSUFFIX
          The suffix used for executable file names.

   PSCOM
          The command line used to convert TeX DVI files into a PostScript
          file.

   PSCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a TeX DVI file is converted into a
          PostScript file. If this is not set, then [458]$PSCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   PSPREFIX
          The prefix used for PostScript file names.

   PSSUFFIX
          The prefix used for PostScript file names.

          The path where the qt binaries are installed. The default value
          is '[459]$QTDIR/bin'.

   QT_CPPPATH
          The path where the qt header files are installed. The default
          value is '[460]$QTDIR/include'. Note: If you set this variable
          to None, the tool won't change the [461]$CPPPATH construction
          variable.

   QT_DEBUG
          Prints lots of debugging information while scanning for moc
          files.

   QT_LIB
          Default value is 'qt'. You may want to set this to 'qt-mt'.
          Note: If you set this variable to None, the tool won't change
          the [462]$LIBS variable.

   QT_LIBPATH
          The path where the qt libraries are installed. The default value
          is '[463]$QTDIR/lib'. Note: If you set this variable to None,

          Command to generate a moc file from a header.

   QT_MOCFROMHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a moc file from a cpp file.
          If this is not set, then [467]$QT_MOCFROMHCOM (the command line)
          is displayed.

   QT_MOCFROMHFLAGS
          Default value is ''. These flags are passed to moc, when moccing
          a header file.

   QT_MOCHPREFIX

          implementation files.

   QT_UISUFFIX
          Default value is '.ui'. Suffix of designer input files.

   QTDIR
          The qt tool tries to take this from os.environ. It also
          initializes all QT_* construction variables listed below. (Note
          that all paths are constructed with python's os.path.join()
          method, but are listed here with the '/' separator for easier
          reading.) In addition, the construction environment variables
          [472]$CPPPATH, [473]$LIBPATH and [474]$LIBS may be modified and
          the variables PROGEMITTER, SHLIBEMITTER and LIBEMITTER are
          modified. Because the build-performance is affected when using
          this tool, you have to explicitly specify it at Environment
          creation:

Environment(tools=['default','qt'])

          The qt tool supports the following operations:

          Automatic moc file generation from header files. You do not have
          to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you.
          However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header
          file must have the same filebase as your implementation file and
          must stay in the same directory. It must have one of the
          suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You can turn off automatic moc
          file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0. See also the
          corresponding builder method .B Moc()

          Automatic moc file generation from cxx files. As stated in the
          qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of the cxx
          file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated
          by the transformation
          ${QT_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
          <basename>.moc. A warning is generated after building the moc
          file, if you do not include the correct file. If you are using
          VariantDir, you may need to specify duplicate=1. You can turn
          off automatic moc file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0.
          See also the corresponding Moc builder method.

          Automatic handling of .ui files. The implementation files
          generated from .ui files are handled much the same as yacc or
          lex files. Each .ui file given as a source of Program, Library
          or SharedLibrary will generate three files, the declaration
          file, the implementation file and a moc file. Because there are
          also generated headers, you may need to specify duplicate=1 in
          calls to VariantDir. See also the corresponding Uic builder
          method.

   RANLIB
          The archive indexer.

   RANLIBCOM
          The command line used to index a static library archive.

   RANLIBCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a static library archive is indexed.
          If this is not set, then [475]$RANLIBCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

          file.

   RCCOMSTR
          The string displayed when invoking the resource compiler to
          build a Microsoft Visual C++ resource file. If this is not set,
          then [476]$RCCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   RCFLAGS
          The flags passed to the resource compiler by the RES builder.

   RCINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          command-line options for specifying directories to be searched
          by the resource compiler. The value of $RCINCFLAGS is created by
          appending $RCINCPREFIX and $RCINCSUFFIX to the beginning and end
          of each directory in $CPPPATH.

   RCINCPREFIX
          The prefix (flag) used to specify an include directory on the
          resource compiler command line. This will be appended to the
          beginning of each directory in the $CPPPATH construction
          variable when the $RCINCFLAGS variable is expanded.

   RCINCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the resource
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          directory in the $CPPPATH construction variable when the
          $RCINCFLAGS variable is expanded.

   RCS
          The RCS executable. Note that this variable is not actually used
          for the command to fetch source files from RCS; see the
          [477]$RCS_CO construction variable, below.

          displayed.

   RCS_COFLAGS
          Options that are passed to the [479]$RCS_CO command.

   RDirs
          A function that converts a string into a list of Dir instances
          by searching the repositories.

   REGSVR

          DLL library whenever the SharedLibrary builder is passed a
          keyword argument of register=1.

   REGSVRCOM
          The command line used on Windows systems to register a
          newly-built DLL library whenever the SharedLibrary builder is
          passed a keyword argument of register=1.

   REGSVRCOMSTR
          The string displayed when registering a newly-built DLL file. If
          this is not set, then [480]$REGSVRCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   REGSVRFLAGS
          Flags passed to the DLL registration program on Windows systems
          when a newly-built DLL library is registered. By default, this
          includes the /s that prevents dialog boxes from popping up and
          requiring user attention.

   RMIC
          The Java RMI stub compiler.

   RMICCOM
          The command line used to compile stub and skeleton class files
          from Java classes that contain RMI implementations. Any options
          specified in the [481]$RMICFLAGS construction variable are
          included on this command line.

   RMICCOMSTR
          The string displayed when compiling stub and skeleton class
          files from Java classes that contain RMI implementations. If

          $RPATHPREFIX and $RPATHSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each
          directory in $RPATH.

   RPATH
          A list of paths to search for shared libraries when running
          programs. Currently only used in the GNU (gnulink), IRIX
          (sgilink) and Sun (sunlink) linkers. Ignored on platforms and
          toolchains that don't support it. Note that the paths added to
          RPATH are not transformed by scons in any way: if you want an
          absolute path, you must make it absolute yourself.

   RPATHPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared
          libraries when running programs. This will be appended to the
          beginning of each directory in the $RPATH construction variable
          when the $_RPATH variable is automatically generated.

   RPATHSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared
          libraries when running programs. This will be appended to the

   SCANNERS
          A list of the available implicit dependency scanners. New file
          scanners may be added by appending to this list, although the

   SWIGCFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C source files
          generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface
          generator. The default value is _wrap[547]$CFILESUFFIX. By

          specified as part of the [548]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGCOM
          The command line used to call the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generator.

   SWIGCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the scripting language wrapper
          and interface generator. If this is not set, then [549]$SWIGCOM
          (the command line) is displayed.

   SWIGCXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ source files
          generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface
          generator. The default value is _wrap[550]$CFILESUFFIX. By
          default, this value is used whenever the -c++ option is
          specified as part of the [551]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGFLAGS
          General options passed to the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generator. This is where you should set -python,
          -perl5, -tcl, or whatever other options you want to specify to
          SWIG. If you set the -c++ option in this variable, scons will,
          by default, generate a C++ intermediate source file with the
          extension that is specified as the [552]$CXXFILESUFFIX variable.

   _SWIGINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          SWIG command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for included files. The value of $_SWIGINCFLAGS is
          created by appending $SWIGINCPREFIX and $SWIGINCSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each directory in $SWIGPATH.

   SWIGINCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be appended to the beginning of each
          directory in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the
          $_SWIGINCFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGINCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each directory
          in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the $_SWIGINCFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGOUTDIR
          Specifies the output directory in which the scripting language
          wrapper and interface generator should place generated
          language-specific files. This will be used by SCons to identify
          the files that will be generated by the swig call, and
          translated into the swig -outdir option on the command line.

   SWIGPATH
          The list of directories that the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generate will search for included files. The SWIG
          implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for
          include files. The default is to use the same path specified as
          $CPPPATH.

          Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in SWIGFLAGS;
          the result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          SWIGPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory
          when they are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a
          directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(SWIGPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(SWIGPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_SWIGINCFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by appending the values of the
          $SWIGINCPREFIX and $SWIGINCSUFFIX construction variables to the
          beginning and end of each directory in $SWIGPATH. Any command
          lines you define that need the SWIGPATH directory list should
          include $_SWIGINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(SWIGCOM="my_swig -o $TARGET $_SWIGINCFLAGS $SORUCES")

   TAR
          The tar archiver.

   TARCOM
          The command line used to call the tar archiver.

   TARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when archiving files using the tar
          archiver. If this is not set, then [553]$TARCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   TARFLAGS
          General options passed to the tar archiver.

   TARGET
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See "Variable Substitution," below.)

   TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See "Variable Substitution," below.)

          The suffix used for tar file names.

   TEMPFILEPREFIX
          The prefix for a temporary file used to execute lines longer
          than $MAXLINELENGTH. The default is '@'. This may be set for

          The parser generator.

   YACCCOM
          The command line used to call the parser generator to generate a
          source file.

   YACCCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          parser generator. If this is not set, then [560]$YACCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(YACCCOMSTR = "Yacc'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   YACCFLAGS
          General options passed to the parser generator. If
          [561]$YACCFLAGS contains a -d option, SCons assumes that the
          call will also create a .h file (if the yacc source file ends in
          a .y suffix) or a .hpp file (if the yacc source file ends in a
          .yy suffix)

   YACCHFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option is used. Note that setting this
          variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          header file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .h.

   YACCHXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C++ header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option is used. Note that setting this
          variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          header file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .hpp, except on Mac OS X, where the
          default is ${TARGET.suffix}.h. because the default bison parser
          generator just appends .h to the name of the generated C++ file.

   YACCVCGFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the file containing the VCG grammar automaton
          definition when the --graph= option is used. Note that setting
          this variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          VCG file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .vcg.

   ZIP
          The zip compression and file packaging utility.

   ZIPCOM
          The command line used to call the zip utility, or the internal
          Python function used to create a zip archive.

   ZIPCOMPRESSION
          The compression flag from the Python zipfile module used by the
          internal Python function to control whether the zip archive is
          compressed or not. The default value is zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED,
          which creates a compressed zip archive. This value has no effect
          when using Python 1.5.2 or if the zipfile module is otherwise
          unavailable.

   ZIPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when archiving files using the zip utility.
          If this is not set, then [562]$ZIPCOM (the command line or
          internal Python function) is displayed.

env = Environment(ZIPCOMSTR = "Zipping $TARGET")

   ZIPFLAGS
          General options passed to the zip utility.

   ZIPSUFFIX
          The suffix used for zip file names.

Appendix B. Builders

   This appendix contains descriptions of all of the Builders that are
   potentially available "out of the box" in this version of SCons.

   CFile(), env.CFile()
          Builds a C source file given a lex (.l) or yacc (.y) input file.
          The suffix specified by the [563]$CFILESUFFIX construction
          variable (.c by default) is automatically added to the target if
          it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.c
env.CFile(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.l')
# builds bar.c
env.CFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.y')

   CXXFile(), env.CXXFile()
          Builds a C++ source file given a lex (.ll) or yacc (.yy) input
          file. The suffix specified by the [564]$CXXFILESUFFIX
          construction variable (.cc by default) is automatically added to
          the target if it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'foo.cc', source = 'foo.ll')
# builds bar.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.yy')

   DVI(), env.DVI()
          Builds a .dvi file from a .tex, .ltx or .latex input file. If
          the source file suffix is .tex, scons will examine the contents
          of the file; if the string \documentclass or \documentstyle is
          found, the file is assumed to be a LaTeX file and the target is
          built by invoking the [565]$LATEXCOM command line; otherwise,
          the [566]$TEXCOM command line is used. If the file is a LaTeX
          file, the DVI builder method will also examine the contents of
          the .aux file and invoke the [567]$BIBTEX command line if the
          string bibdata is found, start [568]$MAKEINDEX to generate an
          index if a .ind file is found and will examine the contents .log
          file and re-run the [569]$LATEXCOM command if the log file says
          it is necessary.

          The suffix .dvi (hard-coded within TeX itself) is automatically
          added to the target if it is not already present. Examples:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.DVI(target = 'aaa.dvi', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.dvi
env.DVI(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.ltx')
# builds from ccc.latex
env.DVI(target = 'ccc.dvi', source = 'ccc.latex')

   Install(), env.Install()
          Installs one or more source files or directories in the
          specified target, which must be a directory. The names of the
          specified source files or directories remain the same within the
          destination directory.

env.Install('/usr/local/bin', source = ['foo', 'bar'])

   InstallAs(), env.InstallAs()
          Installs one or more source files or directories to specific
          names, allowing changing a file or directory name as part of the
          installation. It is an error if the target and source arguments
          list different numbers of files or directories.

env.InstallAs(target = '/usr/local/bin/foo',
              source = 'foo_debug')
env.InstallAs(target = ['../lib/libfoo.a', '../lib/libbar.a'],
              source = ['libFOO.a', 'libBAR.a'])

   Jar(), env.Jar()
          Builds a Java archive (.jar) file from the specified list of
          sources. Any directories in the source list will be searched for
          .class files). Any .java files in the source list will be
          compiled to .class files by calling the [570]Java Builder.

          If the [571]$JARCHDIR value is set, the jar command will change
          to the specified directory using the -C option. If $JARCHDIR is
          not set explicitly, SCons will use the top of any subdirectory
          tree in which Java .class were built by the [572]Java Builder.

          If the contents any of the source files begin with the string
          Manifest-Version, the file is assumed to be a manifest and is
          passed to the jar command with the m option set.

env.Jar(target = 'foo.jar', source = 'classes')

env.Jar(target = 'bar.jar',
        source = ['bar1.java', 'bar2.java'])

   Java(), env.Java()
          Builds one or more Java class files. The sources may be any
          combination of explicit .java files, or directory trees which
          will be scanned for .java files.

          SCons will parse each source .java file to find the classes
          (including inner classes) defined within that file, and from
          that figure out the target .class files that will be created.
          The class files will be placed underneath the specified target
          directory.

          SCons will also search each Java file for the Java package name,
          which it assumes can be found on a line beginning with the
          string package in the first column; the resulting .class files
          will be placed in a directory reflecting the specified package
          name. For example, the file Foo.java defining a single public
          Foo class and containing a package name of sub.dir will generate
          a corresponding sub/dir/Foo.class class file.

          Example:

env.Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['src1', 'src2'])
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['File1.java', 'File2.java'])

   JavaH(), env.JavaH()
          Builds C header and source files for implementing Java native
          methods. The target can be either a directory in which the
          header files will be written, or a header file name which will
          contain all of the definitions. The source can be the names of
          .class files, the names of .java files to be compiled into
          .class files by calling the [573]Java builder method, or the
          objects returned from the Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [574]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the JavaH builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

          Examples:

# builds java_native.h
classes = env.Java(target = 'classdir', source = 'src')
env.JavaH(target = 'java_native.h', source = classes)

# builds include/package_foo.h and include/package_bar.h
env.JavaH(target = 'include',
          source = ['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'])

# builds export/foo.h and export/bar.h
env.JavaH(target = 'export',
          source = ['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
          JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes')

   Library(), env.Library()
          A synonym for the StaticLibrary builder method.

   LoadableModule(), env.LoadableModule()
          On most systems, this is the same as SharedLibrary. On Mac OS X
          (Darwin) platforms, this creates a loadable module bundle.

   M4(), env.M4()
          Builds an output file from an M4 input file. This uses a default
          [575]$M4FLAGS value of -E, which considers all warnings to be
          fatal and stops on the first warning when using the GNU version
          of m4. Example:

env.M4(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.c.m4')

   Moc(), env.Moc()
          Builds an output file from a moc input file. Moc input files are
          either header files or cxx files. This builder is only available
          after using the tool 'qt'. See the [576]$QTDIR variable for more
          information. Example:

env.Moc('foo.h') # generates moc_foo.cc
env.Moc('foo.cpp') # generates foo.moc

   MSVSProject(), env.MSVSProject()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio project file, and by default
          builds a solution file as well.

          This builds a Visual Studio project file, based on the version
          of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [577]$MSVS_VERSION in the
          Environment constructor). For Visual Studio 6, it will generate
          a .dsp file. For Visual Studio 7 (.NET) and later versions, it
          will generate a .vcproj file.

          By default, this also generates a solution file for the
          specified project, a .dsw file for Visual Studio 6 or a .sln
          file for Visual Studio 7 (.NET). This behavior may be disabled
          by specifying auto_build_solution=0 when you call MSVSProject,
          in which case you presumably want to build the solution file(s)
          by calling the MSVSSolution Builder (see below).

          It takes several lists of filenames to be placed into the
          project file. These are currently limited to srcs, incs,
          localincs, resources, and misc. These are pretty
          self-explanatory, but it should be noted that these lists are
          added to the [578]$SOURCES construction variable as strings, NOT
          as SCons File Nodes. This is because they represent file names
          to be added to the project file, not the source files used to
          build the project file.

          The above filename lists are all optional, although at least one
          must be specified for the resulting project file to be
          non-empty.

          In addition to the above lists of values, the following values
          may be specified:

          target: The name of the target .dsp or .vcproj file. The correct
          suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the
          [579]$MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX construction variable will be defined to
          the correct value (see example below).

          variant: The name of this particular variant. For Visual Studio
          7 projects, this can also be a list of variant names. These are
          typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really can be
          anything you want. For Visual Studio 7 projects, they may also
          specify a target platform separated from the variant name by a |
          (vertical pipe) character: Debug|Xbox. The default target
          platform is Win32. Multiple calls to MSVSProject with different
          variants are allowed; all variants will be added to the project
          file with their appropriate build targets and sources.

          buildtarget: An optional string, node, or list of strings or
          nodes (one per build variant), to tell the Visual Studio
          debugger what output target to use in what build variant. The
          number of buildtarget entries must match the number of variant
          entries.

          runfile: The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later
          will run and debug. This appears as the value of the Output
          field in the resutling Visual Studio project file. If this is
          not specified, the default is the same as the specified
          buildtarget value.

          Example usage:

barsrcs = ['bar.cpp'],
barincs = ['bar.h'],
barlocalincs = ['StdAfx.h']
barresources = ['bar.rc','resource.h']
barmisc = ['bar_readme.txt']

dll = env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar.dll',
                        source = barsrcs)

env.MSVSProject(target = 'Bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX'],
                srcs = barsrcs,
                incs = barincs,
                localincs = barlocalincs,
                resources = barresources,
                misc = barmisc,
                buildtarget = dll,
                variant = 'Release')

   MSVSSolution(), env.MSVSSolution()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.

          This builds a Visual Studio solution file, based on the version
          of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [580]$MSVS_VERSION in the
          construction environment). For Visual Studio 6, it will generate
          a .dsw file. For Visual Studio 7 (.NET), it will generate a .sln
          file.

          The following values must be specified:

          target: The name of the target .dsw or .sln file. The correct
          suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the
          value [581]$MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX will be defined to the correct
          value (see example below).

          variant: The name of this particular variant, or a list of
          variant names (the latter is only supported for MSVS 7
          solutions). These are typically things like "Debug" or
          "Release", but really can be anything you want. For MSVS 7 they
          may also specify target platform, like this "Debug|Xbox".
          Default platform is Win32.

          projects: A list of project file names, or Project nodes
          returned by calls to the MSVSProject Builder, to be placed into
          the solution file. It should be noted that these file names are
          NOT added to the $SOURCES environment variable in form of files,
          but rather as strings. This is because they represent file names
          to be added to the solution file, not the source files used to
          build the solution file.

          (NOTE: Currently only one project is supported per solution.)

          Example Usage:

env.MSVSSolution(target = 'Bar' + env['MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX'],
                 projects = ['bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX']],
                 variant = 'Release')

   Object(), env.Object()
          A synonym for the StaticObject builder method.

   Package(), env.Package()
          Builds software distribution packages. Packages consist of files
          to install and packaging information. The former may be
          specified with the source parameter and may be left out, in
          which case the FindInstalledFiles function will collect all
          files that have an Install or InstallAs Builder attached. If the
          target, is not specified it will be deduced from additional
          information given to this Builder.

          The packaging information is specified with the help of
          construction variables documented below. This information is
          called a tag to stress that some of them can also be attached to
          files with the Tag function. The mandatory ones will complain if
          they were not specified. They vary depending on chosen target
          packager.

          The target packager may be selected with the "PACKAGETYPE"
          command line option or with the $PACKAGETYPE construction
          variable. Currently the following packagers available:

          * msi - Microsoft Installer * rpm - Redhat Package Manger * ipkg
          - Itsy Package Management System * tarbz2 - compressed tar *
          targz - compressed tar * zip - zip file * src_tarbz2 -
          compressed tar source * src_targz - compressed tar source *
          src_zip - zip file source

          An updated list is always available under the "package_type"
          option when running "scons --help" on a project that has
          packaging activated.

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'packaging'])
env.Install('/bin/', 'my_program')
env.Package( NAME           = 'foo',
             VERSION        = '1.2.3',
             PACKAGEVERSION = 0,
             PACKAGETYPE    = 'rpm',
             LICENSE        = 'gpl',
             SUMMARY        = 'balalalalal',
             DESCRIPTION    = 'this should be really really long',
             X_RPM_GROUP    = 'Application/fu',
             SOURCE_URL     = 'http://foo.org/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz'
        )

   PCH(), env.PCH()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header. Calling this
          builder method returns a list of two targets: the PCH as the
          first element, and the object file as the second element.
          Normally the object file is ignored. This builder method is only
          provided when Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the
          compiler. The PCH builder method is generally used in conjuction
          with the PCH construction variable to force object files to use
          the precompiled header:

env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]

   PDF(), env.PDF()
          Builds a .pdf file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [582]$PDFSUFFIX construction variable (.pdf by default) is added
          automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PDF(target = 'aaa.pdf', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.pdf from bbb.dvi
env.PDF(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   PostScript(), env.PostScript()
          Builds a .ps file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [583]$PSSUFFIX construction variable (.ps by default) is added
          automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PostScript(target = 'aaa.ps', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.ps from bbb.dvi
env.PostScript(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   Program(), env.Program()
          Builds an executable given one or more object files or C, C++,
          D, or Fortran source files. If any C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files are specified, then they will be automatically compiled to
          object files using the Object builder method; see that builder
          method's description for a list of legal source file suffixes
          and how they are interpreted. The target executable file prefix
          (specified by the [584]$PROGPREFIX construction variable;
          nothing by default) and suffix (specified by the
          [585]$PROGSUFFIX construction variable; by default, .exe on
          Windows systems, nothing on POSIX systems) are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.Program(target = 'foo', source = ['foo.o', 'bar.c', 'baz.f'])

   RES(), env.RES()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ resource file. This builder method
          is only provided when Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW is being
          used as the compiler. The .res (or .o for MinGW) suffix is added
          to the target name if no other suffix is given. The source file
          is scanned for implicit dependencies as though it were a C file.
          Example:

env.RES('resource.rc')

   RMIC(), env.RMIC()
          Builds stub and skeleton class files for remote objects from
          Java .class files. The target is a directory relative to which
          the stub and skeleton class files will be written. The source
          can be the names of .class files, or the objects return from the
          Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [586]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the RMIC builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

classes = env.Java(target = 'classdir', source = 'src')
env.RMIC(target = 'outdir1', source = classes)

env.RMIC(target = 'outdir2',
         source = ['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'])

env.RMIC(target = 'outdir3',
         source = ['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
         JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes')

   RPCGenClient(), env.RPCGenClient()
          Generates an RPC client stub (_clnt.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_clnt.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenHeader(), env.RPCGenHeader()
          Generates an RPC header (.h) file from a specified RPC (.x)
          source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif.h
env.RPCGenHeader('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenService(), env.RPCGenService()
          Generates an RPC server-skeleton (_svc.c) file from a specified
          RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in
          the local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_svc.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenXDR(), env.RPCGenXDR()
          Generates an RPC XDR routine (_xdr.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_xdr.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   SharedLibrary(), env.SharedLibrary()
          Builds a shared library (.so on a POSIX system, .dll on Windows)
          given one or more object files or C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files. If any source files are given, then they will be
          automatically compiled to object files. The static library
          prefix and suffix (if any) are automatically added to the
          target. The target library file prefix (specified by the
          [587]$SHLIBPREFIX construction variable; by default, lib on
          POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems) and suffix (specified
          by the [588]$SHLIBSUFFIX construction variable; by default, .dll
          on Windows systems, .so on POSIX systems) are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          On Windows systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always
          build an import (.lib) library in addition to the shared (.dll)
          library, adding a .lib library with the same basename if there
          is not already a .lib file explicitly listed in the targets.

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          shared library (that is, using the SharedObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

          On Windows systems, specifying register=1 will cause the .dll to
          be registered after it is built using REGSVR32. The command that
          is run ("regsvr32" by default) is determined by [589]$REGSVR
          construction variable, and the flags passed are determined by
          [590]$REGSVRFLAGS. By default, [591]$REGSVRFLAGS includes the /s
          option, to prevent dialogs from popping up and requiring user
          attention when it is run. If you change [592]$REGSVRFLAGS, be
          sure to include the /s option. For example,

env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar',
                  source = ['bar.cxx', 'foo.obj'],
                  register=1)

          will register bar.dll as a COM object when it is done linking
          it.

   SharedObject(), env.SharedObject()
          Builds an object file for inclusion in a shared library. Source
          files must have one of the same set of extensions specified
          above for the StaticObject builder method. On some platforms
          building a shared object requires additional compiler option
          (e.g. -fPIC for gcc) in addition to those needed to build a
          normal (static) object, but on some platforms there is no
          difference between a shared object and a normal (static) one.
          When there is a difference, SCons will only allow shared objects
          to be linked into a shared library, and will use a different
          suffix for shared objects. On platforms where there is no
          difference, SCons will allow both normal (static) and shared
          objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use the
          same suffix for shared and normal (static) objects. The target
          object file prefix (specified by the [593]$SHOBJPREFIX
          construction variable; by default, the same as [594]$OBJPREFIX)
          and suffix (specified by the [595]$SHOBJSUFFIX construction
          variable) are automatically added to the target if not already
          present. Examples:

env.SharedObject(target = 'ddd', source = 'ddd.c')
env.SharedObject(target = 'eee.o', source = 'eee.cpp')
env.SharedObject(target = 'fff.obj', source = 'fff.for')

          Note that the source files will be scanned according to the
          suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner object. See the section
          "Scanner Objects," below, for a more information.

   StaticLibrary(), env.StaticLibrary()
          Builds a static library given one or more object files or C,
          C++, D or Fortran source files. If any source files are given,
          then they will be automatically compiled to object files. The
          static library prefix and suffix (if any) are automatically
          added to the target. The target library file prefix (specified
          by the [596]$LIBPREFIX construction variable; by default, lib on
          POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems) and suffix (specified
          by the [597]$LIBSUFFIX construction variable; by default, .lib
          on Windows systems, .a on POSIX systems) are automatically added
          to the target if not already present. Example:

env.StaticLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          static library (that is, using the StaticObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

   StaticObject(), env.StaticObject()
          Builds a static object file from one or more C, C++, D, or
          Fortran source files. Source files must have one of the
          following extensions:

  .asm    assembly language file
  .ASM    assembly language file
  .c      C file
  .C      Windows:  C file
          POSIX:  C++ file
  .cc     C++ file
  .cpp    C++ file
  .cxx    C++ file
  .cxx    C++ file
  .c++    C++ file
  .C++    C++ file
  .d      D file
  .f      Fortran file
  .F      Windows:  Fortran file
          POSIX:  Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .for    Fortran file
  .FOR    Fortran file
  .fpp    Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .FPP    Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .m      Object C file
  .mm     Object C++ file
  .s      assembly language file
  .S      Windows:  assembly language file
          POSIX:  assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .spp    assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .SPP    assembly language file + C pre-processor

          The target object file prefix (specified by the [598]$OBJPREFIX
          construction variable; nothing by default) and suffix (specified
          by the [599]$OBJSUFFIX construction variable; .obj on Windows
          systems, .o on POSIX systems) are automatically added to the
          target if not already present. Examples:

env.StaticObject(target = 'aaa', source = 'aaa.c')
env.StaticObject(target = 'bbb.o', source = 'bbb.c++')
env.StaticObject(target = 'ccc.obj', source = 'ccc.f')

          Note that the source files will be scanned according to the
          suffix mappings in SourceFileScanner object. See the section
          "Scanner Objects," below, for a more information.

   Tar(), env.Tar()
          Builds a tar archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Tar builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Tar('src.tar', 'src')

# Create the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', 'another')

# Set TARFLAGS to create a gzip-filtered archive.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z')
env.Tar('foo.tar.gz', 'foo')

# Also set the suffix to .tgz.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z',
                  TARSUFFIX = '.tgz')
env.Tar('foo')

   TypeLibrary(), env.TypeLibrary()
          Builds a Windows type library (.tlb) file from an input IDL file
          (.idl). In addition, it will build the associated inteface stub
          and proxy source files, naming them according to the base name
          of the .idl file. For example,

env.TypeLibrary(source="foo.idl")

          Will create foo.tlb, foo.h, foo_i.c, foo_p.c and foo_data.c
          files.

   Uic(), env.Uic()
          Builds a header file, an implementation file and a moc file from
          an ui file. and returns the corresponding nodes in the above
          order. This builder is only available after using the tool 'qt'.
          Note: you can specify .ui files directly as source files to the
          Program, Library and SharedLibrary builders without using this
          builder. Using this builder lets you override the standard
          naming conventions (be careful: prefixes are always prepended to
          names of built files; if you don't want prefixes, you may set
          them to ``). See the [600]$QTDIR variable for more information.
          Example:

env.Uic('foo.ui') # -> ['foo.h', 'uic_foo.cc', 'moc_foo.cc']
env.Uic(target = Split('include/foo.h gen/uicfoo.cc gen/mocfoo.cc'),
        source = 'foo.ui') # -> ['include/foo.h', 'gen/uicfoo.cc', 'gen/mocfoo.c
c']

   Zip(), env.Zip()
          Builds a zip archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Zip builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Zip('src.zip', 'src')

# Create the stuff.zip file.
env.Zip('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Zip('stuff', 'another')

Appendix D. Handling Common Tasks

   There is a common set of simple tasks that many build configurations
   rely on as they become more complex. Most build tools have special
   purpose constructs for performing these tasks, but since SConscript
   files are Python scripts, you can use more flexible built-in Python
   services to perform these tasks. This appendix lists a number of these
   tasks and how to implement them in Python.

   Example D-1. Wildcard globbing to create a list of filenames
import glob
files = glob.glob(wildcard)

   Example D-2. Filename extension substitution
import os.path
filename = os.path.splitext(filename)[0]+extension

   Example D-3. Appending a path prefix to a list of filenames
import os.path
filenames = [os.path.join(prefix, x) for x in filenames]

   or in Python 1.5.2:
import os.path
new_filenames = []
for x in filenames:
    new_filenames.append(os.path.join(prefix, x))

   Example D-4. Substituting a path prefix with another one
if filename.find(old_prefix) == 0:
    filename = filename.replace(old_prefix, new_prefix)

   or in Python 1.5.2:
import string
if string.find(filename, old_prefix) == 0:
    filename = string.replace(filename, old_prefix, new_prefix)

   Example D-5. Filtering a filename list to exclude/retain only a
   specific set of extensions
import os.path
filenames = [x for x in filenames if os.path.splitext(x)[1] in extensions]

   or in Python 1.5.2:
import os.path
new_filenames = []
for x in filenames:
    if os.path.splitext(x)[1] in extensions:
        new_filenames.append(x)

   Example D-6. The "backtick function": run a shell command and capture
   the output
import os
output = os.popen(command).read()

  Notes

   [1257][1]

   In programming parlance, the SConstruct file is declarative, meaning
   you tell SCons what you want done and let it figure out the order in
   which to do it, rather than strictly imperative, where you specify
   explicitly the order in which to do things.
   [1258][2]

   This easily-overlooked distinction between how SCons decides if the
   target itself must be rebuilt and how the target is then used to decide
   if a different target must be rebuilt is one of the confusing things
   that has led to the TargetSignatures and SourceSignatures functions
   being replaced by the simpler Decider function.
   [1259][3]

   Actually, the MD5 signature is used as the name of the file in the
   shared cache directory in which the contents are stored.
