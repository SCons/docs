Preface

   Thank  you  for  taking  the  time  to  read  about  SCons. SCons is a
   next-generation  software  construction tool, or make tool--that is, a
   software utility for building software (or other files) and keeping built
   software up-to-date whenever the underlying input files change.

   The most distinctive thing about SCons is that its configuration files are
   actually scripts, written in the Python programming language. This is in
   contrast to most alternative build tools, which typically invent a new
   language  to configure the build. SCons still has a learning curve, of
   course, because you have to know what functions to call to set up your build
   properly, but the underlying syntax used should be familiar to anyone who
   has ever looked at a Python script.

   Paradoxically, using Python as the configuration file format makes SCons
   easier for non-programmers to learn than the cryptic languages of other
   build  tools,  which  are  usually  invented  by programmers for other
   programmers. This is in no small part due to the consistency and readability
   that are built in to Python. It just so happens that making a real, live
   scripting language the basis for the configuration files makes it a snap for
   more accomplished programmers to do more complicated things with builds, as
   necessary.
     _________________________________________________________________

SCons Principles

   There are a few overriding principles we try to live up to in designing and
   implementing SCons:

   Correctness
          First and foremost, by default, SCons guarantees a correct build even
          if it means sacrificing performance a little. We strive to guarantee
          the build is correct regardless of how the software being built is
          structured, how it may have been written, or how unusual the tools
          are that build it.

   Performance
          Given that the build is correct, we try to make SCons build software
          as quickly as possible. In particular, wherever we may have needed to
          slow down the default SCons behavior to guarantee a correct build, we
          also try to make it easy to speed up SCons through optimization
          options that let you trade off guaranteed correctness in all end
          cases for a speedier build in the usual cases.

   Convenience
          SCons tries to do as much for you out of the box as reasonable,
          including detecting the right tools on your system and using them
          correctly to build the software.

   In a nutshell, we try hard to make SCons just "do the right thing" and build
   software correctly, with a minimum of hassles.

Acknowledgements

   SCons would not exist without a lot of help from a lot of people, many of
   whom may not even be aware that they helped or served as inspiration. So in
   no particular order, and at the risk of leaving out someone:

   First and foremost, SCons owes a tremendous debt to Bob Sidebotham, the
   original author of the classic Perl-based Cons tool which Bob first released
   to the world back around 1996. Bob's work on Cons classic provided the
   underlying architecture and model of specifying a build configuration using
   a real scripting language. My real-world experience working on Cons informed
   many of the design decisions in SCons, including the improved parallel build
   support, making Builder objects easily definable by users, and separating
   the build engine from the wrapping interface.

   Greg Wilson was instrumental in getting SCons started as a real project when
   he initiated the Software Carpentry design competition in February 2000.
   Without that nudge, marrying the advantages of the Cons classic architecture
   with the readability of Python might have just stayed no more than a nice
   idea.

   The entire SCons team have been absolutely wonderful to work with, and SCons
   would be nowhere near as useful a tool without the energy, enthusiasm and
   time people have contributed over the past few years. The "core team" of
   Chad Austin, Anthony Roach, Charles Crain, Steve Leblanc, Gary Oerbrunner,
   Greg Spencer and Christoph Wiedemann have been great about reviewing my (and
   other) changes and catching problems before they get in the code base. Of
   particular technical note: Anthony's outstanding and innovative work on the
   tasking engine has given SCons a vastly superior parallel build model;
   Charles has been the master of the crucial Node infrastructure; Christoph's
   work  on  the Configure infrastructure has added crucial Autoconf-like
   functionality; and Greg has provided excellent support for Microsoft Visual
   Studio.

   Special thanks to David Snopek for contributing his underlying "Autoscons"
   code  that  formed  the  basis  of Christoph's work with the Configure
   functionality. David was extremely generous in making this code available to
   SCons,  given that he initially released it under the GPL and SCons is
   released under a less-restrictive MIT-style license.

   Thanks to Peter Miller for his splendid change management system, Aegis,
   which has provided the SCons project with a robust development methodology
   from  day one, and which showed me how you could integrate incremental
   regression tests into a practical development cycle (years before eXtreme
   Programming arrived on the scene).

   And last, thanks to Guido van Rossum for his elegant scripting language,
   which  is the basis not only for the SCons implementation, but for the
   interface itself.

Simple Builds

   Here's the famous "Hello, World!" program in C:
    int
    main()
    {
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
    }

   And here's how to build it using SCons. Enter the following into a file
   named SConstruct:
    Program('hello.c')

   That's  it.  Now  run  the  scons  command  to build the program. On a
   POSIX-compliant system like Linux or UNIX, you'll see something like:

       % scons
       scons: Reading SConscript files ...
       scons: done reading SConscript files.
       scons: Building targets ...
       cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       scons: done building targets.

   On a Windows system with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, you'll see
   something like:

       C:\>scons
       scons: Reading SConscript files ...
       scons: done reading SConscript files.
       scons: Building targets ...
       cl /nologo /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
       link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
       scons: done building targets.

   First, notice that you only need to specify the name of the source file, and
   that SCons deduces the names of the object and executable files correctly
   from the base of the source file name.

   Second, notice that the same input SConstruct file, without any changes,
   generates the correct output file names on both systems: hello.o and hello
   on POSIX systems, hello.obj and hello.exe on Windows systems. This is a
   simple  example of how SCons makes it extremely easy to write portable
   software builds.

   (Note that we won't provide duplicate side-by-side POSIX and Windows output
   for  all of the examples in this guide; just keep in mind that, unless
   otherwise specified, any of the examples should work equally well on both
   types of systems.)
     _________________________________________________________________

The SConstruct File

   If you're used to build systems like Make you've already figured out that
   the SConstruct file is the SCons equivalent of a Makefile. That is, the
   SConstruct file is the input file that SCons reads to control the build.

   There is, however, an important difference between an SConstruct file and a
   Makefile: the SConstruct file is actually a Python script. If you're not
   already familiar with Python, don't worry. This User's Guide will introduce
   you step-by-step to the relatively small amount of Python you'll need to
   know to be able to use SCons effectively. And Python is very easy to learn.

   One aspect of using Python as the scripting language is that you can put
   comments in your SConstruct file using Python's commenting convention; that
   is, everything between a '#' and the end of the line will be ignored:
      # Arrange to build the "hello" program.
      Program('hello.c')    # "hello.c" is the source file.

   You'll see throughout the remainder of this Guide that being able to use the
   power of a real scripting language can greatly simplify the solutions to
   complex requirements of real-world builds.
     _________________________________________________________________

Making the Output Less Verbose

   You've already seen how SCons prints some messages about what it's doing,
   surrounding the actual commands used to build the software:

         C:\>scons
         scons: Reading SConscript files ...
         scons: done reading SConscript files.
         scons: Building targets ...
         cl /nologo /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
         link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
         scons: done building targets.

   These  messages  emphasize the order in which SCons does its work: the
   configuration files (generically referred to as SConscript files) are read
   and executed first, and only then are the target files built. Among other
   benefits, these messages help to distinguish between errors that occur while
   the configuration files are read, and errors that occur while targets are
   being built.

   The  drawback,  of  course, is that these messages clutter the output.
   Fortunately, they're easily disabled by using the -Q option when invoking
   SCons:

         C:\>scons -Q
         cl /nologo /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
         link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj

   Because we want this User's Guide to focus on what SCons is actually doing,
   we're going use the -Q option to remove these messages from the output of
   all the remaining examples in this Guide.
     _________________________________________________________________

Compiling Multiple Source Files

   You've just seen how to configure SCons to compile a program from a single
   source  file. It's more common, of course, that you'll need to build a
   program from many input source files, not just one. To do this, you need to
   put the source files in a Python list (enclosed in square brackets), like
   so:
      Program(['prog.c', 'file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   A build of the above example would look like:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o file1.o file1.c
         cc -c -o file2.o file2.c
         cc -c -o prog.o prog.c
         cc -o prog prog.o file1.o file2.o

   Notice that SCons deduces the output program name from the first source file
   specified in the list--that is, because the first source file was prog.c,
   SCons  will  name the resulting program prog (or prog.exe on a Windows
   system). If you want to specify a different program name, then you slide the
   list of source files over to the right to make room for the output program
   file name. (SCons puts the output file name to the left of the source file
   names so that the order mimics that of an assignment statement: "program =
   source files".) This makes our example:
      Program('program', ['main.c', 'file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   On Linux, a build of this example would look like:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o file1.o file1.c
         cc -c -o file2.o file2.c
         cc -c -o main.o main.c
         cc -o program main.o file1.o file2.o

   Or on Windows:

         C:\>scons -Q
         cl /nologo /c file1.c /Fofile1.obj
         cl /nologo /c file2.c /Fofile2.obj
         cl /nologo /c main.c /Fomain.obj
         link /nologo /OUT:program.exe main.obj file1.obj file2.obj
     _________________________________________________________________

Keeping SConstruct Files Easy to Read

   One drawback to the use of a Python list for source files is that each file
   name must be enclosed in quotes (either single quotes or double quotes).
   This can get cumbersome and difficult to read when the list of file names is
   long. Fortunately, SCons and Python provide a number of ways to make sure
   that the SConstruct file stays easy to read.

   To make long lists of file names easier to deal with, SCons provides a Split
   function that takes a quoted list of file names, with the names separated by
   spaces or other white-space characters, and turns it into a list of separate
   file names. Using the Split function turns the previous example into:
      Program('program', Split('main.c file1.c file2.'))

   (If you're already familiar with Python, you'll have realized that this is
   similar to the split() method in the Python standard string module. Unlike
   the string.split() method, however, the Split function does not require a
   string as input and will wrap up a single non-string object in a list, or
   return its argument untouched if it's already a list. This comes in handy as
   a way to make sure arbitrary values can be passed to SCons functions without
   having to check the type of the variable by hand.)

   Putting the call to the Split function inside the Program call can also be a
   little unwieldy. A more readable alternative is to assign the output from
   the Split call to a variable name, and then use the variable when calling
   the Program function:
      list = Split('main.c file1.c file2.')
      Program('program', list)

   Lastly, the Split function doesn't care how much white space separates the
   file names in the quoted string. This allows you to create lists of file
   names that span multiple lines, which often makes for easier editing:
      list = Split('main.c
                    file1.c
                    file2.c')
      Program('program', list)
     _________________________________________________________________

Keyword Arguments

   SCons also allows you to identify the output file and input source files
   using Python keyword arguments. The output file is known as the target, and
   the source file(s) are known (logically enough) as the source. The Python
   syntax for this is:
      list = Split('main.c file1.c file2.')
      Program(target = 'program', source = list)

   Because the keywords explicitly identify what each argument is, you can
   actually reverse the order if you prefer:
      list = Split('main.c file1.c file2.')
      Program(source = list, target = 'program')

   Whether or not you choose to use keyword arguments to identify the target
   and  source  files, and the order in which you specify them when using
   keywords, are purely personal choices; SCons functions the same regardless.
     _________________________________________________________________

Compiling Multiple Programs

   In order to compile multiple programs within the same SConstruct file,
   simply call the Program method multiple times, once for each program you
   need to build:
      Program('foo.c')
      Program('bar', ['bar1.c', 'bar2.c'])

   SCons would then build the programs as follows:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o bar1.o bar1.c
         cc -c -o bar2.o bar2.c
         cc -o bar bar1.o bar2.o
         cc -c -o foo.o foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o

   Notice that SCons does not necessarily build the programs in the same order
   in which you specify them in the SConstruct file. SCons does, however,
   recognize  that  the  individual object files must be built before the
   resulting program can be built. We'll discuss this in greater detail in the
   "Dependencies" section, below.
     _________________________________________________________________

Sharing Source Files Between Multiple Programs

   It's  common  to  re-use code by sharing source files between multiple
   programs. One way to do this is to create a library from the common source
   files, which can then be linked into resulting programs. (Creating libraries
   is discussed in section XXX, below.)

   A more straightforward, but perhaps less convenient, way to share source
   files between multiple programs is simply to include the common files in the
   lists of source files for each program:
      Program(Split('foo.c common1.c common2.c'))
      Program('bar', Split('bar1.c bar2.c common1.c common2.c'))

   SCons recognizes that the object files for the common1.c and common2.c
   source files each only need to be built once, even though the resulting
   object  files  are  each linked in to both of the resulting executable
   programs:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o bar1.o bar1.c
         cc -c -o bar2.o bar2.c
         cc -c -o common1.o common1.c
         cc -c -o common2.o common2.c
         cc -o bar bar1.o bar2.o common1.o common2.o
         cc -c -o foo.o foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o common1.o common2.o

   If two or more programs share a lot of common source files, repeating the
   common files in the list for each program can be a maintenance problem when
   you  need to change the list of common files. You can simplify this by
   creating  a  separate  Python  list to hold the common file names, and
   concatenating it with other lists using the Python + operator:
      common = ['common1.c', 'common2.c']
      foo_files = ['foo.c'] + common
      bar_files = ['bar1.c', 'bar2.c'] + common
      Program('foo', foo_files)
      Program('bar', bar_files)

   This is functionally equivalent to the previous example.
     _________________________________________________________________

Building and Linking with Libraries

   It's often useful to organize large software projects by collecting parts of
   the software into one or more libraries. SCons makes it easy to create
   libraries and to use them in the programs.
     _________________________________________________________________

Building Libraries

   You build your own libraries by specifying Library instead of Program:
      Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   SCons uses the appropriate library prefix and suffix for your system. So on
   POSIX or Linux systems, the above example would build as follows (although
   ranlib may not be called on all systems):

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o f1.o f1.c
         cc -c -o f2.o f2.c
         cc -c -o f3.o f3.c
         ar r libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
         ranlib libfoo.a

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:

         C:\>scons -Q
         cl /nologo /c f1.c /Fof1.obj
         cl /nologo /c f2.c /Fof2.obj
         cl /nologo /c f3.c /Fof3.obj
         lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj

   The  rules for the target name of the library are similar to those for
   programs: if you don't explicitly specify a target library name, SCons will
   deduce one from the name of the first source file specified, and SCons will
   add an appropriate file prefix and suffix if you leave them off.
     _________________________________________________________________

Linking with Libraries

   Usually, you build a library because you want to link it with one or more
   programs. You link libraries with a program by specifying the libraries in
   the LIBS construction variable, and by specifying the directory in which the
   library will be found in the LIBPATH construction variable:
      Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
      Program('prog.c', LIBS='foo', LIBPATH='.')

   Notice, of course, that you don't need to specify a library prefix (like
   lib) or suffix (like .a or .lib). SCons uses the correct prefix or suffix
   for the current system.

   On a POSIX or Linux system, a build of the above example would look like:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o f1.o f1.c
         cc -c -o f2.o f2.c
         cc -c -o f3.o f3.c
         ar r libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
         ranlib libfoo.a
         cc -c -o prog.o prog.c
         cc -o prog prog.o -L. -lfoo

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:

         C:\>scons -Q
         cl /nologo /c f1.c /Fof1.obj
         cl /nologo /c f2.c /Fof2.obj
         cl /nologo /c f3.c /Fof3.obj
         lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
         cl /nologo /c prog.c /Foprog.obj
         link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:. foo.lib prog.obj

   As usual, notice that SCons has taken care of constructing the correct
   command lines to link with the specified library on each system.
     _________________________________________________________________

Finding Libraries: the LIBPATH Construction Variable

   By default, the linker will only look in certain system-defined directories
   for libraries. SCons knows how to look for libraries in directories that you
   specify with the LIBPATH construction variable. LIBPATH consists of a list
   of directory names, like so:
      Program('prog.c', LIBS = 'm',
                        LIBPATH = ['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])

   Using a Python list is preferred because it's portable across systems.
   Alternatively, you could put all of the directory names in a single string,
   separated by the system-specific path separator character: a colon on POSIX
   systems:
      LIBPATH = '/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib'

   or a semi-colon on Windows systems:
      LIBPATH = 'C:\lib;D:\lib'

   When the linker is executed, SCons will create appropriate flags so that the
   linker will look for libraries in the same directories as SCons. So on a
   POSIX or Linux system, a build of the above example would look like:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o prog.o prog.c
         cc -o prog prog.o -L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lm

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:

         C:\>scons -Q
         cl /nologo /c prog.c /Foprog.obj
         link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:\usr\lib /LIBPATH:\usr\local\lib m
   .lib prog.obj

   Note again that SCons has taken care of the system-specific details of
   creating the right command-line options.
     _________________________________________________________________

Dependencies

   So far we've seen how SCons handles one-time builds. But the real point of a
   build tool like SCons is to rebuild only the necessary things when source
   files change--or, put another way, SCons should not waste time rebuilding
   things that have already been built. You can see this at work simply be
   re-invoking SCons after building our simple hello example:

        % scons -Q
        cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
        cc -o hello hello.o
        % scons -Q
        scons: `.' is up to date.

   The second time it is executed, SCons realizes that the hello program is
   up-to-date with respect to the current hello.c source file, and avoids
   rebuilding it. You can see this more clearly by naming the hello program
   explicitly on the command line:

        % scons -Q hello
        cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
        cc -o hello hello.o
        % scons -Q hello
        scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Note that SCons reports "...is up to date" only for target files named
   explicitly on the command line, to avoid cluttering the output.
     _________________________________________________________________

Source File Signatures

   The other side of avoiding unnecessary rebuilds is the fundamental build
   tool behavior of rebuilding things when a source file changes, so that the
   built software is up to date. SCons keeps track of this through a signature
   for each source file, and allows you to configure whether you want to use
   the  source  file contents or the modification time (timestamp) as the
   signature.
     _________________________________________________________________

MD5 Source File Signatures

   By default, SCons keeps track of whether a source file has changed based on
   the file's contents, not the modification time. This means that you may be
   surprised  by  the  default SCons behavior if you are used to the Make
   convention of forcing a rebuild by updating the file's modification time
   (using the touch command, for example):

            % scons -Q hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            cc -o hello hello.o
            % touch hello.c
            % scons -Q hello
            scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Even though the file's modification time has changed, SCons realizes that
   the contents of the hello.c file have not changed, and therefore that the
   hello program need not be rebuilt. This avoids unnecessary rebuilds when,
   for  example, someone rewrites the contents of a file without making a
   change. But if the contents of the file really do change, then SCons detects
   the change and rebuilds the program as required:

            % scons -Q hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            cc -o hello hello.o
            % edit hello.c
                [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
            % scons -Q hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            cc -o hello hello.o

   Note  that  you  can,  if you wish, specify this default behavior (MD5
   signatures) explicitly using the SourceSignatures function as follows:
        Program('hello.c')
        SourceSignatures('MD5')
     _________________________________________________________________

Source File Time Stamps

   If you prefer, you can configure SCons to use the modification time of
   source files, not the file contents, when deciding if something needs to be
   rebuilt. To do this, call the SourceSignatures function as follows:
        Program('hello.c')
        SourceSignatures('timestamp')

   This makes SCons act like Make when a file's modification time is updated
   (using the touch command, for example):

            % scons -Q hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            cc -o hello hello.o
            % touch hello.c
            % scons -Q hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            cc -o hello hello.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Target File Signatures

   As you've just seen, SCons uses signatures to decide whether a target file
   is up to date or must be rebuilt. When a target file depends on another
   target file, SCons allows you to separately configure how the signatures of
   "intermediate" target files are used when deciding if a dependent target
   file must be rebuilt.
     _________________________________________________________________

Build Signatures

   Modifying a source file will cause not only its direct target file to be
   rebuilt, but also the target file(s) that depend on that direct target file.
   In our example, changing the contents of the hello.c file causes the hello.o
   file to be rebuilt, which in turn causes the hello program to be rebuilt:

            % scons -Q hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            cc -o hello hello.o
            % edit hello.c
                [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
            % scons -Q hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            cc -o hello hello.o

   What's not obvious, though, is that SCons internally handles the signature
   of the target file(s) (hello.o in the above example) differently from the
   signature of the source file (hello.c). By default, SCons tracks whether a
   target file must be rebuilt by using a build signature that consists of the
   combined signatures of all the files that go into making the target file.
   This is efficient because the accumulated signatures actually give SCons all
   of the information it needs to decide if the target file is out of date.

   If  you wish, you can specify this default behavior (build signatures)
   explicitly using the TargetSignatures function:
        Program('hello.c')
        TargetSignatures('build')
     _________________________________________________________________

File Contents

   Sometimes a source file can be changed in such a way that the contents of
   the rebuilt target file(s) will be exactly the same as the last time the
   file was built. If so, then any other target files that depend on such a
   built-but-not-changed target file actually need not be rebuilt. You can make
   SCons realize that it does not need to rebuild a dependent target file in
   this situation using the TargetSignatures function as follows:
        Program('hello.c')
        TargetSignatures('content')

   So if, for example, a user were to only change a comment in a C file, then
   the rebuilt hello.o file would be exactly the same as the one previously
   built (assuming the compiler doesn't put any build-specific information in
   the object file). SCons would then realize that it would not need to rebuild
   the hello program as follows:

            % scons -Q hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            cc -o hello hello.o
            % edit hello.c
              [CHANGE A COMMENT IN hello.c]
            % scons -Q hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In  essence,  SCons has "short-circuited" any dependent builds when it
   realizes that a target file has been rebuilt to exactly the same file as the
   last build. So configured, SCons does take some extra processing time to
   scan the contents of the target (hello.o) file, but this may save time if
   the  rebuild  that was avoided would have been very time-consuming and
   expensive.
     _________________________________________________________________

Implicit Dependencies: The CPPPATH Construction Variable

   Now suppose that our "Hello, World!" program actually has a #include line to
   include the hello.h file in the compilation:
       #include "hello.h"
       int
       main()
       {
           printf("Hello, %s!\n", string);
       }

   And, for completeness, the hello.h file looks like this:
       #define string    "world"

   In  this case, we want SCons to recognize that, if the contents of the
   hello.h file change, the hello program must be recompiled. To do this, we
   need to modify the SConstruct file like so:
       Program('hello.c', CPPPATH = '.')

   The CPPPATH value tells SCons to look in the current directory ('.') for any
   files included by C source files (.c or .h files). With this assignment in
   the SConstruct file:

          % scons -Q hello
          cc -I. -c -o hello.o hello.c
          cc -o hello hello.o
          % scons -Q hello
          scons: `hello' is up to date.
          % edit hello.h
              [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
          % scons -Q hello
          cc -I. -c -o hello.o hello.c
          cc -o hello hello.o

   First, notice that SCons added the -I. argument from the CPPPATH variable so
   that the compilation would find the hello.h file in the local directory.

   Second, realize that SCons knows that the hello program must be rebuilt
   because it scans the contents of the hello.c file for the #include lines
   that indicate another file is being included in the compilation. SCons
   records these as implicit dependencies of the target file, Consequently,
   when the hello.h file changes, SCons realizes that the hello.c file includes
   it,  and rebuilds the resulting hello program that depends on both the
   hello.c and hello.h files.

   Like  the  LIBPATH  variable,  the  CPPPATH  variable may be a list of
   directories, or a string separated by the system-specific path separate
   character (':' on POSIX/Linux, ';' on Windows). Either way, SCons creates
   the right command-line options so that the following example:
       Program('hello.c', CPPPATH = ['include', '/home/project/inc'])

   Will look like this on POSIX or Linux:

          % scons -Q hello
          cc -Iinclude -I/home/project/inc -c -o hello.o hello.c
          cc -o hello hello.o

   And like this on Windows:

          C:\>scons -Q hello.exe
          cl /nologo /Iinclude /I\home\project\inc /c hello.c /Fohello.obj
          link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
     _________________________________________________________________

Caching Implicit Dependencies

   Scanning each file for #include lines does take some extra processing time.
   When you're doing a full build of a large system, the scanning time is
   usually a very small percentage of the overall time spent on the build.
   You're most likely to notice the scanning time, however, when you rebuild
   all or part of a large system: SCons will likely take some extra time to
   "think about" what must be built before it issues the first build command
   (or decides that everything is up to date and nothing must be rebuilt).

   In practice, having SCons scan files saves time relative to the amount of
   potential time lost to tracking down subtle problems introduced by incorrect
   dependencies. Nevertheless, the "waiting time" while SCons scans files can
   annoy  individual  developers  waiting  for  their  builds  to finish.
   Consequently,  SCons lets you cache the implicit dependencies that its
   scanners find, for use by later builds. You can do this by specifying the
   --implicit-cache option on the command line:

          % scons -Q --implicit-cache hello
          cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
          cc -o hello hello.o
          % scons -Q hello
          scons: `hello' is up to date.

   If you don't want to specify --implicit-cache on the command line each time,
   you  can  make  it  the default behavior for your build by setting the
   implicit_cache option in an SConscript file:
       SetOption('implicit_cache', 1)
     _________________________________________________________________

The --implicit-deps-changed Option

   When using cached implicit dependencies, sometimes you want to "start fresh"
   and  have  SCons  re-scan the files for which it previously cached the
   dependencies. For example, if you have recently installed a new version of
   external code that you use for compilation, the external header files will
   have changed and the previously-cached implicit dependencies will be out of
   date. You can update them by running SCons with the --implicit-deps-changed
   option:

            % scons -Q --implicit-deps-changed hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            cc -o hello hello.o
            % scons -Q hello
            scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In this case, SCons will re-scan all of the implicit dependencies and cache
   updated copies of the information.
     _________________________________________________________________

The --implicit-deps-unchanged Option

   By default when caching dependencies, SCons notices when a file has been
   modified  and  re-scans  the  file for any updated implicit dependency
   information. Sometimes, however, you may want to force SCons to use the
   cached implicit dependencies, even if the source files changed. This can
   speed up a build for example, when you have changed your source files but
   know that you haven't changed any #include lines. In this case, you can use
   the --implicit-deps-unchanged option:

            % scons -Q --implicit-deps-unchanged hello
            cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
            cc -o hello hello.o
            % scons -Q hello
            scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In this case, SCons will assume that the cached implicit dependencies are
   correct and will not bother to re-scan changed files. For typical builds
   after small, incremental changes to source files, the savings may not be
   very big, but sometimes every bit of improved performance counts.
     _________________________________________________________________

The Ignore Method

   Sometimes it makes sense to not rebuild a program, even if a dependency file
   changes.  In  this case, you would tell SCons specifically to ignore a
   dependency as follows:
      hello = Program('hello.c')
      Ignore(hello, 'hello.h')

         % scons -Q hello
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.
         % edit hello.h
           [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Now, the above example is a little contrived, because it's hard to imagine a
   real-world situation where you wouldn't to rebuild hello if the hello.h file
   changed. A more realistic example might be if the hello program is being
   built in a directory that is shared between multiple systems that have
   different copies of the stdio.h include file. In that case, SCons would
   notice the differences between the different systems' copies of stdio.h and
   would rebuild hello each time you change systems. You could avoid these
   rebuilds as follows:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       env.Ignore(hello, '/usr/include/stdio.h')
     _________________________________________________________________

The Depends Method

   On the other hand, sometimes a file depends on another file that is not
   detected  by an SCons scanner. For this situation, SCons allows you to
   specific explicitly that one file depends on another file, and must be
   rebuilt whenever that file changes. This is specified using the Depends
   method:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       env.Depends(hello, 'other_file')

          % scons -Q hello
          cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
          cc -o hello hello.o
          % scons -Q hello
          scons: `hello' is up to date.
          % edit other_file
              [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF other_file]
          % scons -Q hello
          cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
          cc -o hello hello.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Construction Environments

   It is rare that all of the software in a large, complicated system needs to
   be  built  the  same way. For example, different source files may need
   different options enabled on the command line, or different executable
   programs need to be linked with different libraries. SCons accomodates these
   different  build  requirements by allowing you to create and configure
   multiple construction environments that control how the software is built.
   Technically, a construction environment is an object that has a number of
   associated  construction  variables,  each with a name and a value. (A
   construction environment also has an attached set of Builder methods, about
   which we'll learn more later.)

   A construction environment is created by the Environment method. When you
   initialize  a  construction  environment you can set the values of the
   environment's construction variables to control how a program is built. For
   example:
    env = Environment(CC = 'gcc',
                      CCFLAGS = '-O2')

    env.Program('foo.c')

   This example, rather than using the default, explicitly specifies use of the
   GNU C compiler gcc, and further specifies that the -O2 (optimization level
   two) flag should be used when compiling the object file. So a run from this
   example would look like:

       % scons -Q
       gcc -O2 -c -o foo.o foo.c
       gcc -o foo foo.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Multiple Construction Environments

   The real advantage of construction environments is that you can create as
   many different construction environments as you need, each tailored to a
   different  way  to build some piece of software or other file. If, for
   example, we need to build one program with the -O2 flag and another with the
   -g (debug) flag, we would do this like so:
      opt = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
      dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')

      opt.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

      dbg.Program('bar', 'bar.c')

         % scons -Q
         cc -g -c -o bar.o bar.c
         cc -o bar bar.o
         cc -O2 -c -o foo.o foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o

   We  can  even use multiple construction environments to build multiple
   versions of a single program. If you do this by simply trying to use the
   Program builder with both environments, though, like this:
      opt = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
      dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')

      opt.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

      dbg.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

   Then SCons generates the following error:

         % scons -Q

         scons: *** Two different environments were specified for the same targ
   et: foo.o
         File "SConstruct", line 6, in ?

   This is because the two Program calls have each implicitly told SCons to
   generate an object file named foo.o, one with a CCFLAGS value of -O2 and one
   with a CCFLAGS value of -g. SCons can't just decide that one of them should
   take precedence over the other, so it generates the error. To avoid this
   problem, we must explicitly specify that each environment compile foo.c to a
   separately-named object file using the Object call, like so:

      opt = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
      dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')

      o = opt.Object('foo-opt', 'foo.c')
      opt.Program(o)

      d = dbg.Object('foo-dbg', 'foo.c')
      dbg.Program(d)

   Notice that each call to the Object builder returns a value, an internal
   SCons object that represents the object file that will be built. We then use
   that object as input to the Program builder. This avoids having to specify
   explicitly the object file name in multiple places, and makes for a compact,
   readable SConstruct file. Our SCons output then looks like:

         % scons -Q
         cc -g -c -o foo-dbg.o foo.c
         cc -o foo-dbg foo-dbg.o
         cc -O2 -c -o foo-opt.o foo.c
         cc -o foo-opt foo-opt.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Copying Construction Environments

   Sometimes you want more than one construction environment to share the same
   values for one or more variables. Rather than always having to repeat all of
   the common variables when you create each construction environment, you can
   use the Copy method to create a copy of a construction environment.

   Like the Environment call that creates a construction environment, the Copy
   method takes construction variable assignments, which will override the
   values in the copied construction environment. For example, suppose we want
   to use gcc to create three versions of a program, one optimized, one debug,
   and one with neither. We could do this by creating a "base" construction
   environment that sets CC to gcc, and then creating two copies, one which
   sets  CCFLAGS  for  optimization  and the other which sets CCFLAGS for
   debugging:
      env = Environment(CC = 'gcc')
      opt = env.Copy(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
      dbg = env.Copy(CCFLAGS = '-g')

      env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

      o = opt.Object('foo-opt', 'foo.c')
      opt.Program(o)

      d = dbg.Object('foo-dbg', 'foo.c')
      dbg.Program(d)

   Then our output would look like:

         % scons -Q
         gcc -c -o foo.o foo.c
         gcc -o foo foo.o
         gcc -g -c -o foo-dbg.o foo.c
         gcc -o foo-dbg foo-dbg.o
         gcc -O2 -c -o foo-opt.o foo.c
         gcc -o foo-opt foo-opt.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Fetching Values From a Construction Environment

   You can fetch individual construction variables using the normal syntax for
   accessing individual named items in a Python dictionary:
      env = Environment()
      print "CC is:", env['CC']

   This  example SConstruct file doesn't build anything, but because it's
   actually a Python script, it will print the value of CC for us:

         % scons -Q
         CC is: cc
         scons: `.' is up to date.

   A  construction environment, however, is actually a Python object with
   associated methods, etc. If you want to have direct access to only the
   dictionary  of  construction  variables,  you can fetch this using the
   Dictionary method:
      env = Environment(FOO = 'foo', BAR = 'bar')
      dict = env.Dictionary()
      for key in ['OBJSUFFIX', 'LIBSUFFIX', 'PROGSUFFIX']:
          print "key = %s, value = %s" % (key, dict[key])

   This SConstruct file will print the specified dictionary items for us on
   POSIX systems as follows:

         % scons -Q
         key = OBJSUFFIX, value = .o
         key = LIBSUFFIX, value = .a
         key = PROGSUFFIX, value =
         scons: `.' is up to date.

   And on Win32:

         C:\>scons -Q
         key = OBJSUFFIX, value = .obj
         key = LIBSUFFIX, value = .lib
         key = PROGSUFFIX, value = .exe
         scons: `.' is up to date.
     _________________________________________________________________

Modifying a Construction Environment

   SCons provides various methods that support modifying existing values in a
   construction environment.
     _________________________________________________________________

Replacing Values in a Construction Environment

   You can replace existing construction variable values using the Replace
   method:
        env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DDEFINE1')
        env.Program('foo.c')
        env.Replace(CCFLAGS = '-DDEFINE2')
        env.Program('bar.c')

   The replaced value completely overwrites

           % scons -Q
           cc -DDEFINE2 -c -o bar.o bar.c
           cc -o bar bar.o
           cc -DDEFINE1 -c -o foo.o foo.c
           cc -o foo foo.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Appending to the End of Values in a Construction Environment

   You can append a value to an existing construction variable using the Append
   method:
        env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DMY_VALUE')
        env.Append(CCFLAGS = ' -DLAST')
        env.Program('foo.c')

           % scons -Q
           cc -DMY_VALUE -DLAST -c -o foo.o foo.c
           cc -o foo foo.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Appending to the Beginning of Values in a Construction Environment

   You can append a value to the beginning an existing construction variable
   using the Prepend method:
        env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DMY_VALUE')
        env.Prepend(CCFLAGS = '-DFIRST ')
        env.Program('foo.c')

           % scons -Q
           cc -DFIRST -DMY_VALUE -c -o foo.o foo.c
           cc -o foo foo.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Controlling the Environment Used to Execute Build Commands

   When SCons builds a target file, it does not execute the commands with the
   same external environment that you used to execute SCons. Instead, it uses
   the dictionary stored in the ENV construction variable as the external
   environment for executing commands.

   The  most  important  ramification  of  this behavior is that the PATH
   environment variable, which controls where the operating system will look
   for commands and utilities, is not the same as in the external environment
   from which you called SCons. This means that SCons will not, by default,
   necessarily find all of the tools that you can execute from the command
   line.

   The default value of the PATH environment variable on a POSIX system is
   /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin. The default value of the PATH environment
   variable on a Win32 system comes from the Windows registry value for the
   command  interpreter.  If you want to execute any commands--compilers,
   linkers, etc.--that are not in these default locations, you need to set the
   PATH value in the ENV dictionary in your construction environment.

   The simplest way to do this is to initialize explicitly the value when you
   create the construction environment; this is one way to do that:
    path = ['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin']
    env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : path})
     _________________________________________________________________

Propagating PATH From the External Environment

   You may want to propagate the external PATH to the execution environment for
   commands. You do this by initializing the PATH variable with the PATH value
   from the os.environ dictionary, which is Python's way of letting you get at
   the external environment:
      import os
      env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})

   Alternatively, you may find it easier to just propagate the entire external
   environment to the execution environment for commands. This is simpler to
   code than explicity selecting the PATH value:
      import os
      env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)

   Either  of these will guarantee that SCons will be able to execute any
   command that you can execute from the command line. The drawback is that the
   build can behave differently if it's run by people with different PATH
   values in their environment--for example, both the /bin and /usr/local/bin
   directories have different cc commands, then which one will be used to
   compile programs will depend on which directory is listed first in the
   user's PATH variable.
     _________________________________________________________________

Controlling a Build From the Command Line

   SCons provides a number of ways that allow the writer of the SConscript
   files to give users a great deal of control over how to run the builds.
     _________________________________________________________________

Not Having to Specify Command-Line Options Each Time: the SCONSFLAGS
Environment Variable

   Users may find themselves supplying the same command-line options every time
   they run SCons. For example, a user might find that it saves time to specify
   a value of -j 2 to run the builds in parallel. To avoid having to type -j 2
   by hand every time, you can set the external environment variable SCONSFLAGS
   to a string containing command-line options that you want SCons to use.

   If, for example, and you're using a POSIX shell that's compatible with the
   Bourne shell, and you always want SCons to use the -Q option, you can set
   the SCONSFLAGS environment as follows:

         % scons
         scons: Reading SConscript files ...
             ...
         scons: done reading SConscript files.
         scons: Building targets ...
         scons: `.' is up to date.
         scons: done building targets.
         % export SCONSFLAGS="-Q"
         % scons
         scons: Reading SConscript files ...
             ...
         scons: done reading SConscript files.
         scons: Building targets ...
         scons: `.' is up to date.
         scons: done building targets.

   Users  of  csh-style  shells  on  POSIX systems can set the SCONSFLAGS
   environment as follows:

         $ setenv SCONSFLAGS "-Q"

   Windows users may typically want to set this SCONSFLAGS in the appropriate
   tab of the System Properties window.
     _________________________________________________________________

Getting at Command-Line Targets

   SCons supports a COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable that lets you get at the list
   of targets that the user specified on the command line. You can use the
   targets to manipulate the build in any way you wish. As a simple example,
   suppose that you want to print a reminder to the user whenever a specific
   program  is  built.  You can do this by checking for the target in the
   COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS list:
      if 'bar' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
          print "Don't forget to copy `bar' to the archive!"
      Default(Program('foo.c'))
      Program('bar.c')

   Then, running SCons with the default target works as it always does, but
   explicity  specifying the bar target on the command line generates the
   warning message:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o foo.o foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o
         % scons -Q bar
         Don't forget to copy `bar' to the archive!
         cc -c -o bar.o bar.c
         cc -o bar bar.o

   Another practical use for the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable might be to
   speed up a build by only reading certain subsidiary SConscript files if a
   specific target is requested.
     _________________________________________________________________

Controlling the Default Targets

   One of the most basic things you can control is which targets SCons will
   build  by default--that is, when there are no targets specified on the
   command line. As mentioned previously, SCons will normally build every
   target in or below the current directory by default--that is, when you don't
   explicitly specify one or more targets on the command line. Sometimes,
   however, you may want to specify explicitly that only certain programs, or
   programs in certain directories, should be built by default. You do this
   with the Default function:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       env.Program('goodbye.c')
       Default(hello)

   This SConstruct file knows how to build two programs, hello and goodbye, but
   only builds the hello program by default:

          % scons -Q
          cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
          cc -o hello hello.o
          % scons -Q
          scons: `hello' is up to date.
          % scons -Q goodbye
          cc -c -o goodbye.o goodbye.c
          cc -o goodbye goodbye.o

   Note that, even when you use the Default function in your SConstruct file,
   you can still explicitly specify the current directory (.) on the command
   line to tell SCons to build everything in (or below) the current directory:

          % scons -Q .
          cc -c -o goodbye.o goodbye.c
          cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
          cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
          cc -o hello hello.o

   You can also call the Default function more than once, in which case each
   call adds to the list of targets to be built by default:
       env = Environment()
       prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
       Default(prog1)
       prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
       prog3 = env.Program('prog3.c')
       Default(prog3)

   Or you can specify more than one target in a single call to the Default
   function:
       env = Environment()
       prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
       prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
       prog3 = env.Program('prog3.c')
       Default(prog1, prog3)

   Either  of these last two examples will build only the prog1 and prog3
   programs by default:

          % scons -Q
          cc -c -o prog1.o prog1.c
          cc -o prog1 prog1.o
          cc -c -o prog3.o prog3.c
          cc -o prog3 prog3.o
          % scons -Q .
          cc -c -o prog2.o prog2.c
          cc -o prog2 prog2.o

   You can list a directory as an argument to Default:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program(['prog1/main.c', 'prog1/foo.c'])
       env.Program(['prog2/main.c', 'prog2/bar.c'])
       Default('prog1')

   In which case only the target(s) in that directory will be built by default:

          % scons -Q
          cc -c -o prog1/foo.o prog1/foo.c
          cc -c -o prog1/main.o prog1/main.c
          cc -o prog1/main prog1/main.o prog1/foo.o
          % scons -Q
          scons: `prog1' is up to date.
          % scons -Q .
          cc -c -o prog2/bar.o prog2/bar.c
          cc -c -o prog2/main.o prog2/main.c
          cc -o prog2/main prog2/main.o prog2/bar.o

   Lastly, if for some reason you don't want any targets built by default, you
   can use the Python None variable:
       env = Environment()
       prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
       prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
       Default(None)

   Which would produce build output like:

          % scons -Q
          scons: *** No targets specified and no Default() targets found.  Stop
   .
          % scons -Q .
          cc -c -o prog1.o prog1.c
          cc -o prog1 prog1.o
          cc -c -o prog2.o prog2.c
          cc -o prog2 prog2.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Getting at the List of Default Targets

   SCons supports a DEFAULT_TARGETS variable that lets you get at the current
   list of default targets. The DEFAULT_TARGETS variable has two important
   differences   from   the  COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS  variable.  First,  the
   DEFAULT_TARGETS variable is a list of internal SCons nodes, so you need to
   convert the list elements to strings if you want to print them or look for a
   specific target name. Fortunately, you can do this easily by using the
   Python map function to run the list through str:
         prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
         Default(prog1)
         print "DEFAULT_TARGETS is", map(str, DEFAULT_TARGETS)

   (Keep in mind that all of the manipulation of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list takes
   place during the first phase when SCons is reading up the SConscript files,
   which is obvious if we leave off the -Q flag when we run SCons:)

            % scons
            scons: Reading SConscript files ...
            DEFAULT_TARGETS is ['prog1']
            scons: done reading SConscript files.
            scons: Building targets ...
            cc -c -o prog1.o prog1.c
            cc -o prog1 prog1.o
            scons: done building targets.

   Second, the contents of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list change in response to calls
   to the Default: function, as you can see from the following SConstruct file:
         prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
         Default(prog1)
         print "DEFAULT_TARGETS is now", map(str, DEFAULT_TARGETS)
         prog2 = Program('prog2.c')
         Default(prog2)
         print "DEFAULT_TARGETS is now", map(str, DEFAULT_TARGETS)

   Which yields the output:

            % scons
            scons: Reading SConscript files ...
            DEFAULT_TARGETS is now ['prog1']
            DEFAULT_TARGETS is now ['prog1', 'prog2']
            scons: done reading SConscript files.
            scons: Building targets ...
            cc -c -o prog1.o prog1.c
            cc -o prog1 prog1.o
            cc -c -o prog2.o prog2.c
            cc -o prog2 prog2.o
            scons: done building targets.

   In practice, this simply means that you need to pay attention to the order
   in which you call the Default function and refer to the DEFAULT_TARGETS
   list, to make sure that you don't examine the list before you've added the
   default targets you expect to find in it.
     _________________________________________________________________

Getting at the List of Build Targets, Regardless of Origin

   We've already been introduced to the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable, which
   contains  a  list  of  targets  specified on the command line, and the
   DEFAULT_TARGETS variable, which contains a list of targets specified via
   calls to the Default method or function. Sometimes, however, you want a list
   of whatever targets SCons will try to build, regardless of whether the
   targets came from the command line or a Default call. You could code this up
   by hand, as follows:
      if COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
          targets = COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS
      else:
          targets = DEFAULT_TARGETS

   SCons, however, provides a convenient BUILD_TARGETS variable that eliminates
   the need for this by-hand manipulation. Essentially, the BUILD_TARGETS
   variable contains a list of the command-line targets, if any were specified,
   and if no command-line targets were specified, it contains a list of the
   targets specified via the Default method or function.

   Because BUILD_TARGETS may contain a list of SCons nodes, you must convert
   the  list  elements to strings if you want to print them or look for a
   specific target name, just like the DEFAULT_TARGETS list:
      prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
      Program('prog2.c')
      Default(prog1)
      print "BUILD_TARGETS is", map(str, BUILD_TARGETS)

   Notice how the value of BUILD_TARGETS changes depending on whether a target
   is specified on the command line:

         % scons -Q
         BUILD_TARGETS is ['prog1']
         cc -c -o prog1.o prog1.c
         cc -o prog1 prog1.o
         % scons -Q prog2
         BUILD_TARGETS is ['prog2']
         cc -c -o prog2.o prog2.c
         cc -o prog2 prog2.o
         % scons -Q -c .
         BUILD_TARGETS is ['.']
         Removed prog1.o
         Removed prog1
         Removed prog2.o
         Removed prog2
     _________________________________________________________________

Command-Line variable=value Build Options

   You may want to control various aspects of your build by allowing the user
   to specify variable=value values on the command line. For example, suppose
   you want users to be able to build a debug version of a program by running
   SCons as follows:

         % scons -Q debug=1

   SCons provides an ARGUMENTS dictionary that stores all of the variable=value
   assignments from the command line. This allows you to modify aspects of your
   build in response to specifications on the command line. (Note that unless
   you want to require that users always specify an option, you probably want
   to use the Python ARGUMENTS.get() function, which allows you to specify a
   default value to be used if there is no specification on the command line.)

   The following code sets the CCFLAGS construction variable in response to the
   debug flag being set in the ARGUMENTS dictionary:
       env = Environment()
       debug = ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0)
       if int(debug):
           env.Append(CCFLAGS = '-g')
       env.Program('prog.c')

   This results in the -g compiler option being used when debug=1 is used on
   the command line:

          % scons -Q debug=0
          cc -c -o prog.o prog.c
          cc -o prog prog.o
          % scons -Q debug=0
          scons: `.' is up to date.
          % scons -Q debug=1
          cc -g -c -o prog.o prog.c
          cc -o prog prog.o
          % scons -Q debug=1
          scons: `.' is up to date.

   Notice that SCons keeps track of the last values used to build the object
   files, and as a result correctly rebuilds the object and executable files
   only when the value of the debug argument has changed.
     _________________________________________________________________

Controlling Command-Line Build Options

   Being able to use a command-line build option like debug=1 is handy, but it
   can be a chore to write specific Python code to recognize each such option
   and apply the values to a construction variable. To help with this, SCons
   supports a class to define such build options easily, and a mechanism to
   apply the build options to a construction environment. This allows you to
   control how the build options affect construction environments.

   For example, suppose that you want users to set a RELEASE construction
   variable on the command line whenever the time comes to build a program for
   release, and that the value of this variable should be added to the command
   line with the appropriate -D option (or other command line option) to pass
   the value to the C compiler. Here's how you might do that by setting the
   appropriate value in a dictionary for the CPPDEFINES construction variable:
         opts = Options()
         opts.Add('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0)
         env = Environment(options = opts,
                           CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD' : '${RELEASE}'})
         env.Program(['foo.c', 'bar.c'])

   This SConstruct file first creates an Options object (the opts = Options()
   call), and then uses the object's Add method to indicate that the RELEASE
   option can be set on the command line, and that it's default value will be 0
   (the third argument to the Add method). The second argument is a line of
   help text; we'll learn how to use it in the next section.

   We then pass the created Options object as an options keyword argument to
   the Environment call used to create the construction environment. This then
   allows a user to set the RELEASE build option on the command line and have
   the variable show up in the command line used to build each object from a C
   source file:

         % scons -Q RELEASE=1
         cc -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 -c -o bar.o bar.c
         cc -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 -c -o foo.o foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o bar.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Providing Help for Command-Line Build Options

   To make command-line build options most useful, you ideally want to provide
   some help text that will describe the available options when the user runs
   scons -h. You could write this text by hand, but SCons provides an easier
   way. Options objects support a GenerateHelpText method that will, as its
   name indicates, generate text that describes the various options that have
   been added to it. You then pass the output from this method to the Help
   function:
         opts = Options('custom.py')
         opts.Add('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0)
         env = Environment(options = opts)
         Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env))

   SCons will now display some useful text when the -h option is used:

         % scons -Q -h

         RELEASE: Set to 1 to build for release
             default: 0
             actual: 0

         Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   Notice that the help output shows the default value, and the current actual
   value of the build option.
     _________________________________________________________________

Reading Build Options From a File

   Being able to use a command-line build option like debug=1 is handy, but it
   can be a chore to write specific Python code to recognize each such option
   and apply the values to a construction variable. To help with this, SCons
   supports a class to define such build options easily and to read build
   option values from a file. This allows you to control how the build options
   affect construction environments. The way you do this is by specifying a
   file name when you call Options, like custom.py in the following example:
         opts = Options('custom.py')
         opts.Add('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0)
         env = Environment(options = opts,
                           CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD' : '${RELEASE}'})
         env.Program(['foo.c', 'bar.c'])
         Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env))

   This then allows us to control the RELEASE variable by setting it in the
   custom.py file:
      RELEASE = 1

   Note that this file is actually executed like a Python script. Now when we
   run SCons:

         % scons -Q
         cc -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 -c -o bar.o bar.c
         cc -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 -c -o foo.o foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o bar.o

   And if we change the contents of custom.py to:
      RELEASE = 0

   The object files are rebuilt appropriately with the new option:

         % scons -Q
         cc -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 -c -o bar.o bar.c
         cc -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 -c -o foo.o foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o bar.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Canned Build Options

   SCons provides a number of functions that provide ready-made behaviors for
   various types of command-line build options.
     _________________________________________________________________

True/False Values: the BoolOption Build Option

   It's often handy to be able to specify an option that controls a simple
   Boolean variable with a true or false value. It would be even more handy to
   accomodate users who have different preferences for how to represent true or
   false values. The BoolOption function makes it easy to accomodate a variety
   of common values that represent true or false.

   The BoolOption function takes three arguments: the name of the build option,
   the default value of the build option, and the help string for the option.
   It then returns appropriate information for passing to the Add method of an
   Options object, like so:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(BoolOption('RELEASE', 0, 'Set to build for release'))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD' : '${RELEASE}'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   With this build option, the RELEASE variable can now be enabled by setting
   it to the value yes or t:

           % scons -Q RELEASE=yes foo.o
           cc -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 -c -o foo.o foo.c

           % scons -Q RELEASE=t foo.o
           cc -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 -c -o foo.o foo.c

   Other values that equate to true include y, 1, on and all.

   Conversely, RELEASE may now be given a false value by setting it to no or f:

           % scons -Q RELEASE=no foo.o
           cc -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 -c -o foo.o foo.c

           % scons -Q RELEASE=f foo.o
           cc -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 -c -o foo.o foo.c

   Other values that equate to true include n, 0, off and none.

   Lastly,  if a user tries to specify any other value, SCons supplies an
   appropriate error message:

           % scons -Q RELEASE=bad_value foo.o

           scons: *** Error converting option: RELEASE
           Invalid value for boolean option: bad_value
           File "SConstruct", line 4, in ?
     _________________________________________________________________

Single Value From a List: the EnumOption Build Option

   Suppose that we want a user to be able to set a COLOR option that selects a
   background color to be displayed by an application, but that we want to
   restrict the choices to a specific set of allowed colors. This can be set up
   quite easily using the EnumOption, which takes a list of allowed_values in
   addition to the variable name, default value, and help text arguments:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(EnumOption('COLOR', 'red', 'Set background color',
                               allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue')))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   The  user  can  now explicity set the COLOR build option to any of the
   specified allowed values:

           % scons -Q COLOR=red foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="red" -c -o foo.o foo.c
           % scons -Q COLOR=blue foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="blue" -c -o foo.o foo.c
           % scons -Q COLOR=green foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="green" -c -o foo.o foo.c

   But, almost more importantly, an attempt to set COLOR to a value that's not
   in the list generates an error message:

           % scons -Q COLOR=magenta foo.o

           scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: magenta
           File "SConstruct", line 5, in ?

   The  EnumOption function also supports a way to map alternate names to
   allowed values. Suppose, for example, that we want to allow the user to use
   the word navy as a synonym for blue. We do this by adding a map dictionary
   that will map its key values to the desired legal value:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(EnumOption('COLOR', 'red', 'Set background color',
                               allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
                               map={'navy':'blue'}))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   As desired, the user can then use navy on the command line, and SCons will
   translate it into blue when it comes time to use the COLOR option to build a
   target:

           % scons -Q COLOR=navy foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="blue" -c -o foo.o foo.c

   By default, when using the EnumOption function, arguments that differ from
   the legal values only in case are treated as illegal values:

           % scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o

           scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: Red
           File "SConstruct", line 5, in ?
           % scons -Q COLOR=BLUE foo.o

           scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: BLUE
           File "SConstruct", line 5, in ?
           % scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o

           scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: nAvY
           File "SConstruct", line 5, in ?

   The EnumOption function can take an additional ignorecase keyword argument
   that, when set to 1, tells SCons to allow case differences when the values
   are specified:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(EnumOption('COLOR', 'red', 'Set background color',
                               allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
                               map={'navy':'blue'},
                               ignorecase=1))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   Which yields the output:

           % scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="Red" -c -o foo.o foo.c
           % scons -Q COLOR=BLUE foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="BLUE" -c -o foo.o foo.c
           % scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="blue" -c -o foo.o foo.c
           % scons -Q COLOR=green foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="green" -c -o foo.o foo.c

   Notice that an ignorecase value of 1 preserves the case-spelling that the
   user supplied. If you want SCons to translate the names into lower-case,
   regardless of the case used by the user, specify an ignorecase value of 2:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(EnumOption('COLOR', 'red', 'Set background color',
                               allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
                               map={'navy':'blue'},
                               ignorecase=2))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   Now SCons will use values of red, green or blue regardless of how the user
   spells those values on the command line:

           % scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="red" -c -o foo.o foo.c
           % scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="blue" -c -o foo.o foo.c
           % scons -Q COLOR=GREEN foo.o
           cc -DCOLOR="green" -c -o foo.o foo.c
     _________________________________________________________________

Multiple Values From a List: the ListOption Build Option

   Another way in which you might want to allow users to control build option
   is  to specify a list of one or more legal values. SCons supports this
   through the ListOption function. If, for example, we want a user to be able
   to set a COLORS option to one or more of the legal list of values:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(ListOption('COLORS', 0, 'List of colors',
                               ['red', 'green', 'blue']))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'COLORS' : '"${COLORS}"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   A user can now specify a comma-separated list of legal values, which will
   get translated into a space-separated list for passing to the any build
   commands:

           % scons -Q COLORS=red,blue foo.o
           TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found:
           % scons -Q COLORS=blue,green,red foo.o
           TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found:

   In addition, the ListOption function allows the user to specify explicit
   keywords of all or none to select all of the legal values, or none of them,
   respectively:

           % scons -Q COLORS=all foo.o
           TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found:
           % scons -Q COLORS=none foo.o
           TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found:

   And, of course, an illegal value still generates an error message:

           % scons -Q COLORS=magenta foo.o
           TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found:
     _________________________________________________________________

Path Names: the PathOption Build Option

   SCons supports a PathOption function to make it easy to create a build
   option to control an expected path name. If, for example, you need to define
   a variable in the preprocessor that control the location of a configuration
   file:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(PathOption('CONFIG', '/etc/my_config', 'Path to configurati
on file'))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'CONFIG_FILE' : '"$CONFIG"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   This then allows the user to override the CONFIG build option on the command
   line as necessary:

           % scons -Q foo.o

           scons: *** Path does not exist for option CONFIG: Path to configurat
   ion file
           File "SConstruct", line 4, in ?
           % scons -Q CONFIG=/usr/local/etc/other_config foo.o
           cc -DCONFIG_FILE="/usr/local/etc/other_config" -c -o foo.o foo.c
     _________________________________________________________________

Enabled/Disabled Path Names: the PackageOption Build Option

   Sometimes  you  want  to give users even more control over a path name
   variable, allowing them to explicitly enable or disable the path name by
   using yes or no keywords, in addition to allow them to supply an explicit
   path name. SCons supports the PackageOption function to support this:
           opts = Options('custom.py')
           opts.Add(PackageOption('PACKAGE', '/opt/location', 'Location package
'))
           env = Environment(options = opts,
                             CPPDEFINES={'PACKAGE' : '"$PACKAGE"'})
           env.Program('foo.c')

   When the SConscript file uses the PackageOption funciton, user can now still
   use the default or supply an overriding path name, but can now explicitly
   set the specified variable to a value that indicates the package should be
   enabled (in which case the default should be used) or disabled:

           % scons -Q foo.o

           scons: *** Path does not exist for option PACKAGE: Location package
           File "SConstruct", line 4, in ?
           % scons -Q PACKAGE=/usr/local/location foo.o
           cc -DPACKAGE="/usr/local/location" -c -o foo.o foo.c
           % scons -Q PACKAGE=yes foo.o
           cc -DPACKAGE="1" -c -o foo.o foo.c
           % scons -Q PACKAGE=no foo.o
           cc -DPACKAGE="0" -c -o foo.o foo.c
     _________________________________________________________________

Adding Multiple Command-Line Build Options at Once

   Lastly, SCons provides a way to add multiple build options to an Options
   object at once. Instead of having to call the Add method multiple times, you
   can call the AddOptions method with a list of build options to be added to
   the object. Each build option is specified as either a tuple of arguments,
   just like you'd pass to the Add method itself, or as a call to one of the
   canned functions for pre-packaged command-line build options. in any order:
        opts = Options()
        opts.AddOptions(
            ('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0),
            ('CONFIG', 'Configuration file', '/etc/my_config'),
            BoolOption('warnings', 'compilation with -Wall and similiar', 1),
            EnumOption('debug', 'debug output and symbols', 'no',
                       allowed_values=('yes', 'no', 'full'),
                       map={}, ignorecase=0),  # case sensitive
            ListOption('shared',
                       'libraries to build as shared libraries',
                       'all',
                       names = list_of_libs),
            PackageOption('x11',
                          'use X11 installed here (yes = search some places)',
                          'yes'),
            PathOption('qtdir', 'where the root of Qt is installed', qtdir),
        )
     _________________________________________________________________

Providing Build Help

   It's often very useful to be able to give users some help that describes the
   specific targets, build options, etc., that can be used for your build.
   SCons provides the Help function to allow you to specify this help text:
      Help("""
      Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
            'scons debug' to build the debug version.
      """)

   (Note the above use of the Python triple-quote syntax, which comes in very
   handy for specifying multi-line strings like help text.)

   When the SConstruct or SConscript files contain such a call to the Help
   function, the specified help text will be displayed in response to the SCons
   -h option:

         % scons -h
         scons: Reading SConscript files ...
         scons: done reading SConscript files.

         Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
               'scons debug' to build the debug version.

         Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   If there is no Help text in the SConstruct or SConscript files, SCons will
   revert to displaying its standard list that describes the SCons command-line
   options. This list is also always displayed whenever the -H option is used.
     _________________________________________________________________

Installing Files in Other Directories

   Once a program is built, it is often appropriate to install it in another
   directory  for public use. You use the Install method to arrange for a
   program, or any other file, to be copied into a destination directory:
     env = Environment()
     hello = env.Program('hello.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)

   Note, however, that installing a file is still considered a type of file
   "build." This is important when you remember that the default behavior of
   SCons is to build files in or below the current directory. If, as in the
   example  above, you are installing files in a directory outside of the
   top-level SConstruct file's directory tree, you must specify that directory
   (or a higher directory, such as /) for it to install anything there:

        % scons -Q
        cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
        cc -o hello hello.o
        % scons -Q /usr/bin
        Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

   It  can,  however,  be  cumbersome to remember (and type) the specific
   destination directory in which the program (or any other file) should be
   installed. This is an area where the Alias function comes in handy, allowing
   you, for example, to create a pseudo-target named install that can expand to
   the specified destination directory:
     env = Environment()
     hello = env.Program('hello.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
     env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   This then yields the more natural ability to install the program in its
   destination as follows:

        % scons -Q
        cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
        cc -o hello hello.o
        % scons -Q install
        Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"
     _________________________________________________________________

Installing Multiple Files in a Directory

   You  can install multiple files into a directory simply by calling the
   Install function multiple times:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
       env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
       env.Install('/usr/bin', goodbye)
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   Or, more succinctly, listing the multiple input files in a list (just like
   you can do with any other builder):
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
       env.Install('/usr/bin', [hello, goodbye])
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   Either of these two examples yields:

          % scons -Q install
          cc -c -o goodbye.o goodbye.c
          cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
          Install file: "goodbye" as "/usr/bin/goodbye"
          cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
          cc -o hello hello.o
          Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"
     _________________________________________________________________

Installing a File Under a Different Name

   The Install method preserves the name of the file when it is copied into the
   destination directory. If you need to change the name of the file when you
   copy it, use the InstallAs function:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       env.InstallAs('/usr/bin/hello-new', hello)
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   This installs the hello program with the name hello-new as follows:

          % scons -Q install
          cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
          cc -o hello hello.o
          Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello-new"
     _________________________________________________________________

Installing Multiple Files Under Different Names

   Lastly,  if you have multiple files that all need to be installed with
   different file names, you can either call the InstallAs function multiple
   times, or as a shorthand, you can supply same-length lists for the both the
   target and source arguments:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
       env.InstallAs(['/usr/bin/hello-new',
                      '/usr/bin/goodbye-new'],
                     [hello, goodbye])
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   In  this  case,  the  InstallAs  function  loops  through  both  lists
   simultaneously, and copies each source file into its corresponding target
   file name:

          % scons -Q install
          cc -c -o goodbye.o goodbye.c
          cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
          Install file: "goodbye" as "/usr/bin/goodbye-new"
          cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
          cc -o hello hello.o
          Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello-new"
     _________________________________________________________________

Preventing Removal of Targets

   By default, SCons removes targets before building them. Sometimes, however,
   this is not what you want. For example, you may want to update a library
   incrementally, not by having it deleted and then rebuilt from all of the
   constituent object files. In such cases, you can use the Precious method to
   prevent SCons from removing the target before it is built:
    env = Environment()
    lib = env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
    env.Precious(lib)

   Although the output doesn't look any different, SCons does not, in fact,
   delete the target library before rebuilding it:

       % scons -Q
       cc -c -o f1.o f1.c
       cc -c -o f2.o f2.c
       cc -c -o f3.o f3.c
       ar r libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
       ranlib libfoo.a

   SCons will, however, still delete files marked as Precious when the -c
   option is used.
     _________________________________________________________________

Hierarchical Builds

   The  source  code for large software projects rarely stays in a single
   directory, but is nearly always divided into a hierarchy of directories.
   Organizing a large software build using SCons involves creating a hierarchy
   of build scripts using the SConscript function.
     _________________________________________________________________

SConscript Files

   As we've already seen, the build script at the top of the tree is called
   SConstruct. The top-level SConstruct file can use the SConscript function to
   include other subsidiary scripts in the build. These subsidiary scripts can,
   in turn, use the SConscript function to include still other scripts in the
   build. By convention, these subsidiary scripts are usually named SConscript.
   For example, a top-level SConstruct file might arrange for four subsidiary
   scripts to be included in the build as follows:
      SConscript(['drivers/display/SConscript',
                  'drivers/mouse/SConscript',
                  'parser/SConscript',
                  'utilities/SConscript'])

   In this case, the SConstruct file lists all of the SConscript files in the
   build explicitly. (Note, however, that not every directory in the tree
   necessarily has an SConscript file.) Alternatively, the drivers subdirectory
   might contain an intermediate SConscript file, in which case the SConscript
   call in the top-level SConstruct file would look like:
      SConscript(['drivers/SConscript',
                  'parser/SConscript',
                  'utilities/SConscript'])

   And the subsidiary SConscript file in the drivers subdirectory would look
   like:
      SConscript(['display/SConscript',
                  'mouse/SConscript'])

   Whether you list all of the SConscript files in the top-level SConstruct
   file, or place a subsidiary SConscript file in intervening directories, or
   use  some  mix  of the two schemes, is up to you and the needs of your
   software.
     _________________________________________________________________

Path Names Are Relative to the SConscript Directory

   Subsidiary SConscript files make it easy to create a build hierarchy because
   all of the file and directory names in a subsidiary SConscript files are
   interpreted relative to the directory in which the SConscript file lives.
   Typically, this allows the SConscript file containing the instructions to
   build a target file to live in the same directory as the source files from
   which the target will be built, making it easy to update how the software is
   built whenever files are added or deleted (or other changes are made).

   For example, suppose we want to build two programs prog1 and prog2 in two
   separate directories with the same names as the programs. One typical way to
   do this would be with a top-level SConstruct file like this:
      SConscript(['prog1/SConscript',
                  'prog2/SConscript'])

   And subsidiary SConscript files that look like this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('prog1', ['main.c', 'foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   And this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('prog2', ['main.c', 'bar1.c', 'bar2.c'])

   Then, when we run SCons in the top-level directory, our build looks like:

          % scons -Q
          cc -c -o prog1/foo1.o prog1/foo1.c
          cc -c -o prog1/foo2.o prog1/foo2.c
          cc -c -o prog1/main.o prog1/main.c
          cc -o prog1/prog1 prog1/main.o prog1/foo1.o prog1/foo2.o
          cc -c -o prog2/bar1.o prog2/bar1.c
          cc -c -o prog2/bar2.o prog2/bar2.c
          cc -c -o prog2/main.o prog2/main.c
          cc -o prog2/prog2 prog2/main.o prog2/bar1.o prog2/bar2.o

   Notice the following: First, you can have files with the same names in
   multiple directories, like main.c in the above example. Second, unlike
   standard recursive use of Make, SCons stays in the top-level directory
   (where the SConstruct file lives) and issues commands that use the path
   names from the top-level directory to the target and source files within the
   hierarchy.
     _________________________________________________________________

Top-Level Path Names in Subsidiary SConscript Files

   If  you need to use a file from another directory, it's sometimes more
   convenient to specify the path to a file in another directory from the
   top-level  SConstruct directory, even when you're using that file in a
   subsidiary  SConscript  file  in a subdirectory. You can tell SCons to
   interpret a path name as relative to the top-level SConstruct directory, not
   the local directory of the SConscript file, by appending a # (hash mark) to
   the beginning of the path name:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program('prog', ['main.c', '#lib/foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   In this example, the lib directory is directly underneath the top-level
   SConstruct directory. If the above SConscript file is in a subdirectory
   named src/prog, the output would look like:

          % scons -Q
          cc -c -o lib/foo1.o lib/foo1.c
          cc -c -o src/prog/foo2.o src/prog/foo2.c
          cc -c -o src/prog/main.o src/prog/main.c
          cc -o src/prog/prog src/prog/main.o lib/foo1.o src/prog/foo2.o

   (Notice that the lib/foo1.o object file is built in the same directory as
   its source file. See section XXX, below, for information about how to build
   the object file in a different subdirectory.)
     _________________________________________________________________

Absolute Path Names

   Of course, you can always specify an absolute path name for a file--for
   example:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program('prog', ['main.c', '/usr/joe/lib/foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   Which, when executed, would yield:

          % scons -Q
          cc -c -o src/prog/foo2.o src/prog/foo2.c
          cc -c -o src/prog/main.o src/prog/main.c
          cc -c -o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.c
          cc -o src/prog/prog src/prog/main.o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o src/prog/foo2
   .o

   (As  was  the  case  with  top-relative  path  names,  notice that the
   /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o object file is built in the same directory as its source
   file. See section XXX, below, for information about how to build the object
   file in a different subdirectory.)
     _________________________________________________________________

Sharing Environments (and Other Variables) Between SConscript Files

   In the previous example, each of the subsidiary SConscript files created its
   own  construction  environment by calling Environment separately. This
   obviously  works fine, but if each program must be built with the same
   construction  variables, it's cumbersome and error-prone to initialize
   separate construction environments in the same way over and over in each
   subsidiary SConscript file.

   SCons supports the ability to export variables from a parent SConscript file
   to  its  subsidiary SConscript files, which allows you to share common
   initialized values throughout your build hierarchy.
     _________________________________________________________________

Exporting Variables

   There are two ways to export a variable, such as a construction environment,
   from an SConscript file, so that it may be used by other SConscript files.
   First, you can call the Export function with a list of variables, or a
   string white-space separated variable names. Each call to Export adds one or
   more variables to a global list of variables that are available for import
   by other SConscript files.
        env = Environment()
        Export('env')

   You may export more than one variable name at a time:
        env = Environment()
        debug = ARGUMENTS['debug']
        Export('env', 'debug')

   Because  white space is not legal in Python variable names, the Export
   function will even automatically split a string into separate names for you:
        Export('env debug')

   Second, you can specify a list of variables to export as a second argument
   to the SConscript function call:
        SConscript('src/SConscript', 'env')

   Or as the exports keyword argument:
        SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='env')

   These calls export the specified variables to only the listed SConscript
   files. You may, however, specify more than one SConscript file in a list:
        SConscript(['src1/SConscript',
                    'src2/SConscript'], exports='env')

   This is functionally equivalent to calling the SConscript function multiple
   times with the same exports argument, one per SConscript file.
     _________________________________________________________________

Importing Variables

   Once a variable has been exported from a calling SConscript file, it may be
   used in other SConscript files by calling the Import function:
        Import('env')
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   The Import call makes the env construction environment available to the
   SConscript file, after which the variable can be used to build programs,
   libraries, etc.

   Like the Export function, the Import function can be used with multiple
   variable names:
        Import('env', 'debug')
        env = env.Copy(DEBUG = debug)
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   And the Import function will similarly split a string along white-space into
   separate variable names:
        Import('env debug')
        env = env.Copy(DEBUG = debug)
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   Lastly, as a special case, you may import all of the variables that have
   been exported by supplying an asterisk to the Import function:
        Import('*')
        env = env.Copy(DEBUG = debug)
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   If you're dealing with a lot of SConscript files, this can be a lot simpler
   than keeping arbitrary lists of imported variables in each file.
     _________________________________________________________________

Returning Values From an SConscript File

   Sometimes, you would like to be able to use information from a subsidiary
   SConscript file in some way. For example, suppose that you want to create
   one library from source files scattered throughout a number of subsidiary
   SConscript files. You can do this by using the Return function to return
   values from the subsidiary SConscript files to the calling file.

   If, for example, we have two subdirectories foo and bar that should each
   contribute a source file to a Library, what we'd like to be able to do is
   collect the object files from the subsidiary SConscript calls like this:
          env = Environment()
          Export('env')
          objs = []
          for subdir in ['foo', 'bar']:
              o = SConscript('%s/SConscript' % subdir)
              objs.append(o)
          env.Library('prog', objs)

   We can do this by using the Return function in the foo/SConscript file like
   this:
          Import('env')
          obj = env.Object('foo.c')
          Return('obj')

   (The corresponding bar/SConscript file should be pretty obvious.) Then when
   we run SCons, the object files from the subsidiary subdirectories are all
   correctly archived in the desired library:

           % scons -Q
           cc -c -o bar/bar.o bar/bar.c
           cc -c -o foo/foo.o foo/foo.c
           ar r libprog.a foo/foo.o bar/bar.o
           ranlib libprog.a
     _________________________________________________________________

Separating Source and Build Directories

   It's often useful to keep any built files completely separate from the
   source files. This is usually done by creating one or more separate build
   directories that are used to hold the built objects files, libraries, and
   executable programs, etc. for a specific flavor of build. SCons provides two
   ways to do this, one through the SConscript function that we've already
   seen, and the second through a more flexible BuildDir function.
     _________________________________________________________________

Specifying a Build Directory as Part of an SConscript Call

   The most straightforward way to establish a build directory uses the fact
   that the usual way to set up a build hierarchy is to have an SConscript file
   in the source subdirectory. If you then pass a build_dir argument to the
   SConscript function call:
      SConscript('src/SConscript', build_dir='build')

   SCons will then build all of the files in the build subdirectory:

         % ls src
         SConscript  hello.c
         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o build/hello.o build/hello.c
         cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
         % ls build
         SConscript  hello  hello.c  hello.o

   But wait a minute--what's going on here? SCons created the object file
   build/hello.o in the build subdirectory, as expected. But even though our
   hello.c file lives in the src subdirectory, SCons has actually compiled a
   build/hello.c file to create the object file.

   What's happened is that SCons has duplicated the hello.c file from the src
   subdirectory to the build subdirectory, and built the program from there.
   The next section explains why SCons does this.
     _________________________________________________________________

Why SCons Duplicates Source Files in a Build Directory

   SCons duplicates source files in build directories because it's the most
   straightforward way to guarantee a correct build regardless of include-file
   directory paths, relative references between files, or tool support for
   putting files in different locations, and the SCons philosophy is to, by
   default, guarantee a correct build in all cases.

   The most direct reason to duplicate source files in build directories is
   simply that some tools (mostly older vesions) are written to only build
   their output files in the same directory as the source files. In this case,
   the choices are either to build the output file in the source directory and
   move it to the build directory, or to duplicate the source files in the
   build directory.

   Additionally, relative references between files can cause problems if we
   don't just duplicate the hierarchy of source files in the build directory.
   You can see this at work in use of the C preprocessor #include mechanism
   with double quotes, not angle brackets:
      #include "file.h"

   The de facto standard behavior for most C compilers in this case is to first
   look in the same directory as the source file that contains the #include
   line, then to look in the directories in the preprocessor search path. Add
   to this that the SCons implementation of support for code repositories
   (described below) means not all of the files will be found in the same
   directory  hierarchy, and the simplest way to make sure that the right
   include  file is found is to duplicate the source files into the build
   directory,  which  provides a correct build regardless of the original
   location(s) of the source files.

   Although source-file duplication guarantees a correct build even in these
   end-cases, it can usually be safely disabled. The next section describes how
   you can disable the duplication of source files in the build directory.
     _________________________________________________________________

Telling SCons to Not Duplicate Source Files in the Build Directory

   In most cases and with most tool sets, SCons can place its target files in a
   build subdirectory without duplicating the source files and everything will
   work just fine. You can disable the default SCons behavior by specifying
   duplicate=0 when you call the SConscript function:
      SConscript('src/SConscript', build_dir='build', duplicate=0)

   When this flag is specified, SCons uses the build directory like most people
   expect--that is, the output files are placed in the build directory while
   the source files stay in the source directory:

         % ls src
         SConscript
         hello.c
         % scons -Q
         cc -c src/hello.c -o build/hello.o
         cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
         % ls build
         hello
         hello.o
     _________________________________________________________________

The BuildDir Function

   Use the BuildDir function to establish that target files should be built in
   a separate directory from the source files:
      BuildDir('build', 'src')
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('build/hello.c')

   Note that when you're not using an SConscript file in the src subdirectory,
   you  must  actually  specify  that  the program must be built from the
   build/hello.c file that SCons will duplicate in the build subdirectory.

   When using the BuildDir function directly, SCons still duplicates the source
   files in the build directory by default:

         % ls src
         hello.c
         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o build/hello.o build/hello.c
         cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
         % ls build
         hello  hello.c  hello.o

   You can specify the same duplicate=0 argument that you can specify for an
   SConscript call:
      BuildDir('build', 'src', duplicate=0)
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('build/hello.c')

   In which case SCons will disable duplication of the source files:

         % ls src
         hello.c
         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o build/hello.o src/hello.c
         cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
         % ls build
         hello  hello.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Using BuildDir With an SConscript File

   Even when using the BuildDir function, it's much more natural to use it with
   a subsidiary SConscript file. For example, if the src/SConscript looks like
   this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('hello.c')

   Then our SConstruct file could look like:
      BuildDir('build', 'src')
      SConscript('build/SConscript')

   Yielding the following output:

         % ls src
         SConscript  hello.c
         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o build/hello.o build/hello.c
         cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
         % ls build
         SConscript  hello  hello.c  hello.o

   Notice that this is completely equivalent to the use of SConscript that we
   learned about in the previous section.
     _________________________________________________________________

Variant Builds

   The BuildDir function now gives us everything we need to show how easy it is
   to create variant builds using SCons. Suppose, for example, that we want to
   build a program for both Windows and Linux platforms, but that we want to
   build it in a shared directory with separate side-by-side build directories
   for the Windows and Linux versions of the program.
    platform = ARGUMENTS.get('OS', Platform())

    include = "#export/$PLATFORM/include"
    lib = "#export/$PLATFORM/lib"
    bin = "#export/$PLATFORM/bin"

    env = Environment(PLATFORM = platform,
                      BINDIR = bin,
                      INCDIR = include,
                      LIBDIR = lib,
                      CPPPATH = [include],
                      LIBPATH = [lib],
                      LIBS = 'world')

    Export('env')

    env.SConscript('src/SConscript', build_dir='build/$PLATFORM')

    #
    #BuildDir("#build/$PLATFORM", 'src')
    #SConscript("build/$PLATFORM/hello/SConscript")
    #SConscript("build/$PLATFORM/world/SConscript")

   This SConstruct file, when run on a Linux system, yields:

       % scons -Q OS=linux
       Install file: "build/linux/world/world.h" as "export/linux/include/world
   .h"
       cc -Iexport/linux/include -c -o build/linux/hello/hello.o build/linux/he
   llo/hello.c
       cc -Iexport/linux/include -c -o build/linux/world/world.o build/linux/wo
   rld/world.c
       ar r build/linux/world/libworld.a build/linux/world/world.o
       ranlib build/linux/world/libworld.a
       Install file: "build/linux/world/libworld.a" as "export/linux/lib/libwor
   ld.a"
       cc -o build/linux/hello/hello build/linux/hello/hello.o -Lexport/linux/l
   ib -lworld
       Install file: "build/linux/hello/hello" as "export/linux/bin/hello"

   The same SConstruct file on Windows would build:

       C:\>scons -Q OS=windows
       Install file: "build/windows/world/world.h" as "export/windows/include/w
   orld.h"
       cl /nologo /Iexport\windows\include /c build\windows\hello\hello.c /Fobu
   ild\windows\hello\hello.obj
       cl /nologo /Iexport\windows\include /c build\windows\world\world.c /Fobu
   ild\windows\world\world.obj
       lib /nologo /OUT:build\windows\world\world.lib build\windows\world\world
   .obj
       Install file: "build/windows/world/world.lib" as "export/windows/lib/wor
   ld.lib"
       link /nologo /OUT:build\windows\hello\hello.exe /LIBPATH:export\windows\
   lib world.lib build\windows\hello\hello.obj
       Install file: "build/windows/hello/hello.exe" as "export/windows/bin/hel
   lo.exe"
     _________________________________________________________________

Writing Your Own Builders

   Although SCons provides many useful methods for building common software
   products: programs, libraries, documents. you frequently want to be able to
   build some other type of file not supported directly by SCons Fortunately,
   SCons makes it very easy to define your own Builder objects for any custom
   file types you want to build. (In fact, the SCons interfaces for creating
   Builder objects are flexible enough and easy enough to use that all of the
   the SCons built-in Builder objects are created the mechanisms described in
   this section.)
     _________________________________________________________________

Writing Builders That Execute External Commands

   The simplest Builder to create is one that executes an external command. For
   example, if we want to build an output file by running the contents of the
   input file through a command named foobuild, creating that Builder might
   look like:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')

   All the above line does is create a free-standing Builder object. The next
   section will show us how to actually use it.
     _________________________________________________________________

Attaching a Builder to a Construction Environment

   A  Builder  object  isn't useful until it's attached to a construction
   environment so that we can call it to arrange for files to be built. This is
   done through the BUILDERS construction variable in an environment. The
   BUILDERS variable is a Python dictionary that maps the names by which you
   want to call various Builder objects to the objects themselves. For example,
   if  we  want  to call the Builder we just defined by the name Foo, our
   SConstruct file might look like:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})

   With the Builder so attached to our construction environment we can now
   actually call it like so:
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')

   Then when we run SCons it looks like:

         % scons -Q
         foobuild < file.input > file.foo

   Note,  however,  that  the default BUILDERS variable in a construction
   environment comes with a default set of Builder objects already defined:
   Program, Library, etc. And when we explicitly set the BUILDERS variable when
   we create the construction environment, the default Builders are no longer
   part of the environment:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
       env.Program('hello.c')

         % scons -Q
         AttributeError: SConsEnvironment instance has no attribute 'Program':

   To be able use both our own defined Builder objects and the default Builder
   objects in the same construction environment, you can either add to the
   BUILDERS variable using the Append function:
       env = Environment()
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env.Append(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
       env.Program('hello.c')

   Or  you can explicitly set the appropriately-named key in the BUILDERS
   dictionary:
       env = Environment()
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env['BUILDERS']['Foo'] = bld
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
       env.Program('hello.c')

   Either  way,  the  same construction environment can then use both the
   newly-defined Foo Builder and the default Program Builder:

         % scons -Q
         foobuild < file.input > file.foo
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Letting SCons Handle The File Suffixes

   By supplying additional information when you create a Builder, you can let
   SCons add appropriate file suffixes to the target and/or the source file.
   For example, rather than having to specify explicitly that you want the Foo
   Builder to build the file.foo target file from the file.input source file,
   you can give the .foo and .input suffixes to the Builder, making for more
   compact and readable calls to the Foo Builder:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET',
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file1')
       env.Foo('file2')

         % scons -Q
         foobuild < file1.input > file1.foo
         foobuild < file2.input > file2.foo

   You can also supply a prefix keyword argument if it's appropriate to have
   SCons append a prefix to the beginning of target file names.

Builders That Execute Python Functions

   In SCons, you don't have to call an external command to build a file. You
   can, instead, define a Python function that a Builder object can invoke to
   build your target file (or files). Such a builder function definition looks
   like:
       def build_function(target, source, env):
           # Code to build "target" from "source"
           return None

   The arguments of a builder function are:

   target
          A list of Node objects representing the target or targets to be built
          by this builder function. The file names of these target(s) may be
          extracted using the Python str funcion.

   source
          A list of Node objects representing the sources to be used by this
          builder  function to build the targets. The file names of these
          source(s) may be extracted using the Python str funcion.

   env
          The construction environment used for building the target(s). The
          builder  function may use any of the environment's construction
          variables in any way to affect how it builds the targets.

   The builder function must return a 0 or None value if the target(s) are
   built successfully. The builder function may raise an exception or return
   any non-zero value to indicate that the build is unsuccessful,

   Once you've defined the Python function that will build your target file,
   defining a Builder object for it is as simple as specifying the name of the
   function, instead of an external command, as the Builder's action argument:
       def build_function(target, source, env):
           # Code to build "target" from "source"
           return None
       bld = Builder(action = build_function,
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file')

   And notice that the output changes slightly, reflecting the fact that a
   Python function, not an external command, is now called to build the target
   file:

         % scons -Q
         build_function("file.foo", "file.input")
     _________________________________________________________________

Builders That Create Actions Using a Generator

   SCons Builder objects can create an action "on the fly" by using a function
   called a generator. This provides a great deal of flexibility to construct
   just the right list of commands to build your target. A generator looks
   like:
       def generate_actions(source, target, env, for_signature):
           return 'foobuild < %s > %s' % (target[0], source[0])

   The arguments of a generator are:

   source
          A list of Node objects representing the sources to be built by the
          command or other action generated by this function. The file names of
          these source(s) may be extracted using the Python str funcion.

   target
          A list of Node objects representing the target or targets to be built
          by the command or other action generated by this function. The file
          names  of these target(s) may be extracted using the Python str
          funcion.

   env
          The construction environment used for building the target(s). The
          generator may use any of the environment's construction variables in
          any way to determine what command or other action to return.

   for_signature
          A  flag that specifies whether the generator is being called to
          contribute to a build signature, as opposed to actually executing the
          command.

   The generator must return a command string or other action that will be used
   to build the specified target(s) from the specified source(s).

   Once  you've  defined  a  generator, you create a Builder to use it by
   specifying the generator keyword argument instead of action.
       def generate_actions(source, target, env, for_signature):
           return 'foobuild < %s > %s' % (source[0], target[0])
       bld = Builder(generator = generate_actions,
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file')

         % scons -Q
         foobuild < file.input > file.foo

   Note that it's illegal to specify both an action and a generator for a
   Builder.
     _________________________________________________________________

Builders That Modify the Target or Source Lists Using an Emitter

   SCons supports the ability for a Builder to modify the lists of target(s)
   from the specified source(s).
       def modify_targets(target, source, env):
           target.append('new_target')
           source.append('new_source')
           return target, source
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild $TARGETS - $SOURCES',
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input',
                     emitter = modify_targets)
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file')

         % scons -Q
         foobuild file.foo new_target - file.input new_source

       bld = Builder(action = 'XXX',
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input',
                     emitter = 'MY_EMITTER')
       def modify1(target, source, env):
           return target, source
       def modify2(target, source, env):
           return target, source
       env1 = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld},
                          MY_EMITTER = modify1)
       env2 = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld},
                          MY_EMITTER = modify2)
       env1.Foo('file1')
       env2.Foo('file2')
     _________________________________________________________________

Not Writing a Builder: The Command Builder

   Creating a Builder and attaching it to a construction environment allows for
   a lot of flexibility when you want to re-use actions to build multiple files
   of the same type. This can, however, be cumbersome if you only need to
   execute one specific command to build a single file (or group of files). For
   these situations, SCons supports a Command Builder that arranges for a
   specific action to be executed to build a specific file or files. This looks
   a lot like the other builders (like Program, Object, etc.), but takes as an
   additional argument the command to be executed to build the file:
     env = Environment()
     env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', "sed 's/x/y/' < $SOURCE > $TARGET")

       % scons -Q
       sed 's/x/y/' < foo.in > foo.out

   This is often more convenient than creating a Builder object and adding it
   to the BUILDERS variable of a construction environment

   Note that the action you
     env = Environment()
     def build(target, source, env):
         # Whatever it takes to build
         return None
     env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', build)

       % scons -Q
       build("foo.out", "foo.in")
     _________________________________________________________________

Writing Scanners

   SCons has built-in scanners that know how to look in C, Fortran and IDL
   source files for information about other files that targets built from those
   files  depend  on--for  example,  in  the case of files that use the C
   preprocessor, the .h files that are specified using #include lines in the
   source.  You can use the same mechanisms that SCons uses to create its
   built-in scanners to write scanners of your own for file types that SCons
   does not know how to scan "out of the box."
     _________________________________________________________________

A Simple Scanner Example

   Suppose, for example, that we want to create a simple scanner for .foo
   files.  A .foo file contains some text that will be processed, and can
   include other files on lines that begin with include followed by a file
   name:
      include filename.foo

   Scanning a file will be handled by a Python function that you must supply.
   Here  is a function that will use the Python re module to scan for the
   include lines in our example:
      import re

      include_re = re.compile(r'^include\\s+(\\S+)$', re.M)

      def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg):
          contents = node.get_contents()
          return include_re.findall(contents)

   The scanner function must accept the four specified arguments and return a
   list of implicit dependencies. Presumably, these would be dependencies found
   from examining the contents of the file, although the function can perform
   any manipulation at all to generate the list of dependencies.

   node
          An SCons node object representing the file being scanned. The path
          name to the file can be used by converting the node to a string using
          the str() function, or an internal SCons get_contents() object method
          can be used to fetch the contents.

   env
          The construction environment in effect for this scan. The scanner
          function  may  choose  to  use construction variables from this
          environment to affect its behavior.

   path
          A list of directories that form the search path for included files
          for this scanner. This is how SCons handles the CPPPATH and LIBPATH
          variables.

   arg
          An optional argument that you can choose to have passed to this
          scanner function by various scanner instances.

   A Scanner object is created using the Scanner function, which typically
   takes an skeys argument to associate the type of file suffix with this
   scanner.  The Scanner object must then be associated with the SCANNERS
   construction variable of a construction environment, typically by using the
   Append method:
       kscan = Scanner(function = kfile_scan,
                       skeys = ['.k'])
       env.Append(SCANNERS = kscan)

   When we put it all together, it looks like:
        import re

        include_re = re.compile(r'^include\\s+(\\S+)$', re.M)

        def kfile_scan(node, env, path):
            contents = node.get_contents()
            includes = include_re.findall(contents)
            return includes

        kscan = Scanner(function = kfile_scan,
                        skeys = ['.k'])

        env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : '/usr/local/bin'})
        env.Append(SCANNERS = kscan)

        env.Command('foo', 'foo.k', 'kprocess < $SOURCES > $TARGET')
     _________________________________________________________________

Building From Code Repositories

   Often,  a software project will have one or more central repositories,
   directory trees that contain source code, or derived files, or both. You can
   eliminate additional unnecessary rebuilds of files by having SCons use files
   from one or more code repositories to build files in your local build tree.
     _________________________________________________________________

The Repository Method

   It's often useful to allow multiple programmers working on a project to
   build software from source files and/or derived files that are stored in a
   centrally-accessible repository, a directory copy of the source code tree.
   (Note that this is not the sort of repository maintained by a source code
   management system like BitKeeper, CVS, or Subversion. For information about
   using SCons with these systems, see the section, "Fetching Files From Source
   Code Management Systems," below.) You use the Repository method to tell
   SCons to search one or more central code repositories (in order) for any
   source files and derived files that are not present in the local build tree:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program('hello.c')
       Repository('/usr/repository1', '/usr/repository2')

   Multiple calls to the Repository method will simply add repositories to the
   global  list  that SCons maintains, with the exception that SCons will
   automatically  eliminate  the  current  directory and any non-existent
   directories from the list.
     _________________________________________________________________

Finding source files in repositories

   The above example specifies that SCons will first search for files under the
   /usr/repository1  tree and next under the /usr/repository2 tree. SCons
   expects that any files it searches for will be found in the same position
   relative to the top-level directory. In the above example, if the hello.c
   file is not found in the local build tree, SCons will search first for a
   /usr/repository1/hello.c file and then for a /usr/repository1/hello.c file
   to use in its place.

   So given the SConstruct file above, if the hello.c file exists in the local
   build directory, SCons will rebuild the hello program as normal:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o

   If,  however,  there  is  no  local  hello.c  file,  but one exists in
   /usr/repository1, SCons will recompile the hello program from the source
   file it finds in the repository:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         gcc -c /usr/repository1/hello.c -o hello.o
         gcc -o hello hello.o

   And   similarly,   if   there   is   no  local  hello.c  file  and  no
   /usr/repository1/hello.c, but one exists in /usr/repository2:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Finding the SConstruct file in repositories

   SCons will also search in repositories for the SConstruct file and any
   specified SConscript files. This poses a problem, though: how can SCons
   search a repository tree for an SConstruct file if the SConstruct file
   itself contains the information about the pathname of the repository? To
   solve this problem, SCons allows you to specify repository directories on
   the command line using the -Y option:

         % scons -Q -Y /usr/repository1 -Y /usr/repository2

   When  looking for source or derived files, SCons will first search the
   repositories specified on the command line, and then search the repositories
   specified in the SConstruct or SConscript files.
     _________________________________________________________________

Finding derived files in repositories

   If a repository contains not only source files, but also derived files (such
   as object files, libraries, or executables), SCons will perform its normal
   MD5 signature calculation to decide if a derived file in a repository is
   up-to-date,  or  the  derived  file must be rebuilt in the local build
   directory.  For  the  SCons signature calculation to work correctly, a
   repository tree must contain the .sconsign files that SCons uses to keep
   track of signature information.

   Usually, this would be done by a build integrator who would run SCons in the
   repository to create all of its derived files and .sconsign files, or who
   would SCons in a separate build directory and copying the resulting tree to
   the desired repository:

         % cd /usr/repository1
         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o file1.o file1.c
         cc -c -o file2.o file2.c
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o file1.o file2.o

   (Note that this is safe even if the SConstruct file lists /usr/repository1
   as a repository, because SCons will remove the current build directory from
   its repository list for that invocation.)

   Now, with the repository populated, we only need to create the one local
   source file we're interested in working with at the moment, and use the -Y
   option to tell SCons to fetch any other files it needs from the repository:

         % cd $HOME/build
         % edit hello.c
         % scons -Q -Y /usr/repository1
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o /usr/repository1/file1.o /usr/repository1/file2.o

   Notice that SCons realizes that it does not need to rebuild local copies
   file1.o and file2.o files, but instead uses the already-compiled files from
   the repository.
     _________________________________________________________________

Guaranteeing local copies of files

   If the repository tree contains the complete results of a build, and we try
   to build from the repository without any files in our local tree, something
   moderately surprising happens:

         % mkdir $HOME/build2
         % cd $HOME/build2
         % scons -Q -Y /usr/all/repository hello
         scons: `hello' is up-to-date.

   Why does SCons say that the hello program is up-to-date when there is no
   hello program in the local build directory? Because the repository (not the
   local directory) contains the up-to-date hello program, and SCons correctly
   determines that nothing needs to be done to rebuild that up-to-date copy of
   the file.

   There are, however, many times when you want to ensure that a local copy of
   a file always exists. A packaging or testing script, for example, may assume
   that certain generated files exist locally. To tell SCons to make a copy of
   any up-to-date repository file in the local build directory, use the Local
   function:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       Local(hello)

   If we then run the same command, SCons will make a local copy of the program
   from the repository copy, and tell you that it is doing so:

         % scons -Y /usr/all/repository hello
         Local copy of hello from /usr/all/repository/hello
         scons: `hello' is up-to-date.

   (Notice that, because the act of making the local copy is not considered a
   "build" of the hello file, SCons still reports that it is up-to-date.)
     _________________________________________________________________

Caching Built Files

   On multi-developer software projects, you can sometimes speed up every
   developer's builds a lot by allowing them to share the derived files that
   they build. SCons makes this easy, as well as reliable.
     _________________________________________________________________

Specifying the Shared Cache Directory

   To  enable  sharing of derived files, use the CacheDir function in any
   SConscript file:
       CacheDir('/usr/local/build_cache')

   Note that the directory you specify must already exist and be readable and
   writable by all developers who will be sharing derived files. It should also
   be in some central location that all builds will be able to access. In
   environments where developers are using separate systems (like individual
   workstations) for builds, this directory would typically be on a shared or
   NFS-mounted file system.

   Here's what happens: When a build has a CacheDir specified, every time a
   file is built, it is stored in the shared cache directory along with its MD5
   build signature. On subsequent builds, before an action is invoked to build
   a file, SCons will check the shared cache directory to see if a file with
   the exact same build signature already exists. If so, the derived file will
   not be built locally, but will be copied into the local build directory from
   the shared cache directory, like so:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q -c
         Removed hello.o
         Removed hello
         % scons -Q
         Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
         Retrieved `hello' from cache
     _________________________________________________________________

Keeping Build Output Consistent

   One potential drawback to using a shared cache is that your build output can
   be inconsistent from invocation to invocation, because any given file may be
   rebuilt one time and retrieved from the shared cache the next time. This can
   make analyzing build output more difficult, especially for automated scripts
   that expect consistent output each time.

   If, however, you use the --cache-show option, SCons will print the command
   line  that  it  would have executed to build the file, even when it is
   retrieving the file from the shared cache. This makes the build output
   consistent every time the build is run:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q -c
         Removed hello.o
         Removed hello
         % scons -Q --cache-show
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o

   The trade-off, of course, is that you no longer know whether or not SCons
   has retrieved a derived file from cache or has rebuilt it locally.
     _________________________________________________________________

Not Retrieving Files From a Shared Cache

   Retrieving  an  already-built  file from the shared cache is usually a
   significant time-savings over rebuilding the file, but how much of a savings
   (or even whether it saves time at all) can depend a great deal on your
   system or network configuration. For example, retrieving cached files from a
   busy server over a busy network might end up being slower than rebuilding
   the files locally.

   In these cases, you can specify the --cache-disable command-line option to
   tell  SCons  to not retrieve already-built files from the shared cache
   directory:

         % scons -Q
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q -c
         Removed hello.o
         Removed hello
         % scons -Q
         Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
         Retrieved `hello' from cache
         % scons -Q -c
         Removed hello.o
         Removed hello
         % scons -Q --cache-disable
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
     _________________________________________________________________

Populating a Shared Cache With Already-Built Files

   Sometimes, you may have one or more derived files already built in your
   local build tree that you wish to make available to other people doing
   builds. For example, you may find it more effective to perform integration
   builds with the cache disabled (per the previous section) and only populate
   the shared cache directory with the built files after the integration build
   has completed successfully. This way, the cache will only get filled up with
   derived files that are part of a complete, successful build not with files
   that might be later overwritten while you debug integration problems.

   In this case, you can use the the --cache-force option to tell SCons to put
   all derived files in the cache, even if the files had already been built by
   a previous invocation:

         % scons -Q --cache-disable
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q -c
         Removed hello.o
         Removed hello
         % scons -Q --cache-disable
         cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q --cache-force
         scons: `.' is up to date.
         % scons -Q -c
         Removed hello.o
         Removed hello
         % scons -Q
         Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
         Retrieved `hello' from cache

   Notice how the above sample run demonstrates that the --cache-disable option
   avoids putting the built hello.o and hello files in the cache, but after
   using the --cache-force option, the files have been put in the cache for the
   next invocation to retrieve.
     _________________________________________________________________

Alias Targets

   We've already seen how you can use the Alias function to create a target
   named install:
     env = Environment()
     hello = env.Program('hello.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
     env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   You can then use this alias on the command line to tell SCons more naturally
   that you want to install files:

        % scons -Q install
        cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
        cc -o hello hello.o
        Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

   Like other Builder methods, though, the Alias method returns an object
   representing the alias being built. You can then use this object as input to
   anothother Builder. This is especially useful if you use such an object as
   input  to  another call to the Alias Builder, allowing you to create a
   hierarchy of nested aliases:
     env = Environment()
     p = env.Program('foo.c')
     l = env.Library('bar.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', p)
     env.Install('/usr/lib', l)
     ib = env.Alias('install-bin', '/usr/bin')
     il = env.Alias('install-lib', '/usr/lib')
     env.Alias('install', [ib, il])

   This example defines separate install, install-bin, and install-lib aliases,
   allowing you finer control over what gets installed:

        % scons -Q install-bin
        cc -c -o foo.o foo.c
        cc -o foo foo.o
        Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
        % scons -Q install-lib
        cc -c -o bar.o bar.c
        ar r libbar.a bar.o
        ranlib libbar.a
        Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"
        % scons -Q -c /
        Removed foo.o
        Removed foo
        Removed /usr/bin/foo
        Removed bar.o
        Removed libbar.a
        Removed /usr/lib/libbar.a
        % scons -Q install
        cc -c -o foo.o foo.c
        cc -o foo foo.o
        Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
        cc -c -o bar.o bar.c
        ar r libbar.a bar.o
        ranlib libbar.a
        Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"
