<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The
<B>scons</B>

utility builds software (or other files) by determining which
component pieces must be rebuilt and executing the necessary commands to
rebuild them.
<P>
By default,
<B>scons</B>

searches for a file named
<I>SConstruct</I>,

<I>Sconstruct</I>,

or
<I>sconstruct</I>

(in that order) in the current directory and reads its
configuration from the first file found.
An alternate file name may be
specified via the
<B>-f</B>

option.
<P>
The
<I>SConstruct</I>

file can specify subsidiary
configuration files using the
<B>SConscript</B>()

function.
By convention,
these subsidiary files are named
<I>SConscript</I>,

although any name may be used.
(Because of this naming convention,
the term &quot;SConscript files&quot;
is sometimes used to refer
generically to all
<B>scons</B>

configuration files,
regardless of actual file name.)
<P>
The configuration files
specify the target files to be built, and
(optionally) the rules to build those targets.  Reasonable default
rules exist for building common software components (executable
programs, object files, libraries), so that for most software
projects, only the target and input files need be specified.
<P>
Before reading the
<I>SConstruct</I>

file,
<B>scons</B>

looks for a directory named
<I>site_scons</I>

in various system directories (see below) and the directory containing the
<I>SConstruct</I>

file; for each of those dirs which exists,
<I>site_scons</I>

is prepended to sys.path,
the file
<I>site_scons/site_init.py</I>,

is evaluated if it exists,
and the directory
<I>site_scons/site_tools</I>

is prepended to the default toolpath if it exists.
See the
<I>--no-site-dir</I>

and
<I>--site-dir</I>

options for more details.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

reads and executes the SConscript files as Python scripts,
so you may use normal Python scripting capabilities
(such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported Python libraries)
to handle complicated build situations.
<B>scons</B>,

however, reads and executes all of the SConscript files
<I>before</I>

it begins building any targets.
To make this obvious,
<B>scons</B>

prints the following messages about what it is doing:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$ scons foo.out
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets  ...
cp foo.in foo.out
scons: done building targets.
$

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The status messages
(everything except the line that reads &quot;cp foo.in foo.out&quot;)
may be suppressed using the
<B>-Q</B>

option.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

does not automatically propagate
the external environment used to execute
<B>scons</B>

to the commands used to build target files.
This is so that builds will be guaranteed
repeatable regardless of the environment
variables set at the time
<B>scons</B>

is invoked.
This also means that if the compiler or other commands
that you want to use to build your target files
are not in standard system locations,
<B>scons</B>

will not find them unless
you explicitly set the PATH
to include those locations.
Whenever you create an
<B>scons</B>

construction environment,
you can propagate the value of PATH
from your external environment as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Similarly, if the commands use external environment variables
like $PATH, $HOME, $JAVA_HOME, $LANG, $SHELL, $TERM, etc.,
these variables can also be explicitly propagated:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH'],
                         'HOME' : os.environ['HOME']})

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Or you may explicitly propagate the invoking user's
complete external environment:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
import os
env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
This comes at the expense of making your build
dependent on the user's environment being set correctly,
but it may be more convenient for many configurations.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

can scan known input files automatically for dependency
information (for example, #include statements
in C or C++ files) and will rebuild dependent files appropriately
whenever any &quot;included&quot; input file changes.
<B>scons</B>

supports the
ability to define new scanners for unknown input file types.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

knows how to fetch files automatically from
SCCS or RCS subdirectories
using SCCS, RCS or BitKeeper.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

is normally executed in a top-level directory containing a
<I>SConstruct</I>

file, optionally specifying
as command-line arguments
the target file or files to be built.
<P>
By default, the command
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
will build all target files in or below the current directory.
Explicit default targets
(to be built when no targets are specified on the command line)
may be defined the SConscript file(s)
using the
<B>Default()</B>

function, described below.
<P>
Even when
<B>Default()</B>

targets are specified in the SConscript file(s),
all target files in or below the current directory
may be built by explicitly specifying
the current directory (.)
as a command-line target:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons .

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Building all target files,
including any files outside of the current directory,
may be specified by supplying a command-line target
of the root directory (on POSIX systems):
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons /

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets
should be built (on Windows systems):
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons C:\ D:\

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
To build only specific targets,
supply them as command-line arguments:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons foo bar

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
in which case only the specified targets will be built
(along with any derived files on which they depend).
<P>
Specifying &quot;cleanup&quot; targets in SConscript files is not usually necessary.
The
<B>-c</B>

flag removes all files
necessary to build the specified target:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons -c .

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
to remove all target files, or:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons -c build export

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
to remove target files under build and export.
Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
<B>Clean()</B>

function.
Conversely, targets that would normally be removed by the
<B>-c</B>

invocation
can be prevented from being removed by using the
<B>NoClean</B>()

function.
<P>
A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by
remaining at the top-level directory (where the
<I>SConstruct</I>

file lives) and specifying the subdirectory as the target to be
built:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons src/subdir

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
or by changing directory and invoking scons with the
<B>-u</B>

option, which traverses up the directory
hierarchy until it finds the
<I>SConstruct</I>

file, and then builds
targets relatively to the current subdirectory:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
cd src/subdir
scons -u .

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<B>scons</B>

supports building multiple targets in parallel via a
<B>-j</B>

option that takes, as its argument, the number
of simultaneous tasks that may be spawned:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons -j 4

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
builds four targets in parallel, for example.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can
be shared between multiple builds.  When caching is enabled in a
SConscript file, any target files built by
<B>scons</B>

will be copied
to the cache.  If an up-to-date target file is found in the cache, it
will be retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally.
Caching behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
<B>--cache-force</B>,

<B>--cache-disable</B>,

and
<B>--cache-show</B>

command-line options.  The
<B>--random</B>

option is useful to prevent multiple builds
from trying to update the cache simultaneously.
<P>
Values of variables to be passed to the SConscript file(s)
may be specified on the command line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons debug=1 .

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
These variables are available in SConscript files
through the ARGUMENTS dictionary,
and can be used in the SConscript file(s) to modify
the build in any way:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')
else:
    env = Environment()

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The command-line variable arguments are also available
in the ARGLIST list,
indexed by their order on the command line.
This allows you to process them in order rather than by name,
if necessary.
ARGLIST[0] returns a tuple
containing (argname, argvalue).
A Python exception is thrown if you
try to access a list member that
does not exist.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

requires Python version 2.4 or later.
There should be no other dependencies or requirements to run
<B>scons.</B>

<P>



By default,
<B>scons</B>

knows how to search for available programming tools
on various systems.
On Windows systems,
<B>scons</B>

searches in order for the
Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
the MinGW tool chain,
the Intel compiler tools,
and the PharLap ETS compiler.
On OS/2 systems,
<B>scons</B>

searches in order for the
OS/2 compiler,
the GCC tool chain,
and the Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP-UX, and Sun Solaris systems,
<B>scons</B>

searches for the native compiler tools
(MIPSpro, Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively)
and the GCC tool chain.
On all other platforms,
including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) platforms,
<B>scons</B>

searches in order
for the GCC tool chain,
the Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
and the Intel compiler tools.
You may, of course, override these default values
by appropriate configuration of
Environment construction variables.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

In general,
<B>scons</B>

supports the same command-line options as GNU
<B>make</B>,

and many of those supported by
<B>cons</B>.

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-b<DD>
Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of
<B>make.</B>

<P>
<DT>-c, --clean, --remove<DD>
Clean up by removing all target files for which a construction
command is specified.
Also remove any files or directories associated to the construction command
using the
<B>Clean</B>()

function.
Will not remove any targets specified by the
<B>NoClean</B>()

function.
<P>
<DT>--cache-debug=<I>file</I>

<DD>
Print debug information about the
<B>CacheDir</B>()

derived-file caching
to the specified
<I>file</I>.

If
<I>file</I>

is
<B>-</B>

(a hyphen),
the debug information are printed to the standard output.
The printed messages describe what signature file names are
being looked for in, retrieved from, or written to the
<B>CacheDir</B>()

directory tree.
<P>
<DT>--cache-disable, --no-cache<DD>
Disable the derived-file caching specified by
<B>CacheDir</B>().

<B>scons</B>

will neither retrieve files from the cache
nor copy files to the cache.
<P>
<DT>--cache-force, --cache-populate<DD>
When using
<B>CacheDir</B>(),

populate a cache by copying any already-existing, up-to-date
derived files to the cache,
in addition to files built by this invocation.
This is useful to populate a new cache with
all the current derived files,
or to add to the cache any derived files
recently built with caching disabled via the
<B>--cache-disable</B>

option.
<P>
<DT>--cache-show<DD>
When using
<B>CacheDir</B>()

and retrieving a derived file from the cache,
show the command
that would have been executed to build the file,
instead of the usual report,
&quot;Retrieved `file' from cache.&quot;
This will produce consistent output for build logs,
regardless of whether a target
file was rebuilt or retrieved from the cache.
<P>
<DT>--config=<I>mode</I>

<DD>
This specifies how the
<B>Configure</B>

call should use or generate the
results of configuration tests.
The option should be specified from
among the following choices:
<P>
<DT>--config=auto<DD>
scons will use its normal dependency mechanisms
to decide if a test must be rebuilt or not.
This saves time by not running the same configuration tests
every time you invoke scons,
but will overlook changes in system header files
or external commands (such as compilers)
if you don't specify those dependecies explicitly.
This is the default behavior.
<P>
<DT>--config=force<DD>
If this option is specified,
all configuration tests will be re-run
regardless of whether the
cached results are out of date.
This can be used to explicitly
force the configuration tests to be updated
in response to an otherwise unconfigured change
in a system header file or compiler.
<P>
<DT>--config=cache<DD>
If this option is specified,
no configuration tests will be rerun
and all results will be taken from cache.
Note that scons will still consider it an error
if --config=cache is specified
and a necessary test does not
yet have any results in the cache.
<P>
<DT>-C<I> directory</I>,  --directory=<I>directory</I>

<DD>
Change to the specified
<I>directory</I>

before searching for the
<I>SConstruct</I>,

<I>Sconstruct</I>,

or
<I>sconstruct</I>

file, or doing anything
else.  Multiple
<B>-C</B>

options are interpreted
relative to the previous one, and the right-most
<B>-C</B>

option wins. (This option is nearly
equivalent to
<B>-f directory/SConstruct</B>,

except that it will search for
<I>SConstruct</I>,

<I>Sconstruct</I>,

or
<I>sconstruct</I>

in the specified directory.)
<P>





<P>
<DT>-D<DD>
Works exactly the same way as the
<B>-u</B>

option except for the way default targets are handled.
When this option is used and no targets are specified on the command line,
all default targets are built, whether or not they are below the current
directory.
<P>
<DT>--debug=<I>type</I>

<DD>
Debug the build process.
<I>type</I>

specifies what type of debugging:
<P>
<DT>--debug=count<DD>
Print how many objects are created
of the various classes used internally by SCons
before and after reading the SConscript files
and before and after building targets.
This is not supported when SCons is executed with the Python
<B>-O</B>

(optimized) option
or when the SCons modules
have been compiled with optimization
(that is, when executing from
<B>*.pyo</B>

files).
<P>
<DT>--debug=duplicate<DD>
Print a line for each unlink/relink (or copy) of a variant file from
its source file.  Includes debugging info for unlinking stale variant
files, as well as unlinking old targets before building them.
<P>
<DT>--debug=dtree<DD>
A synonym for the newer
<B>--tree=derived</B>

option.
This will be deprecated in some future release
and ultimately removed.
<P>
<DT>--debug=explain<DD>
Print an explanation of precisely why
<B>scons</B>

is deciding to (re-)build any targets.
(Note:  this does not print anything
for targets that are
<I>not</I>

rebuilt.)
<P>
<DT>--debug=findlibs<DD>
Instruct the scanner that searches for libraries
to print a message about each potential library
name it is searching for,
and about the actual libraries it finds.
<P>
<DT>--debug=includes<DD>
Print the include tree after each top-level target is built.
This is generally used to find out what files are included by the sources
of a given derived file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$ scons --debug=includes foo.o

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>--debug=memoizer<DD>
Prints a summary of hits and misses using the Memoizer,
an internal subsystem that counts
how often SCons uses cached values in memory
instead of recomputing them each time they're needed.
<P>
<DT>--debug=memory<DD>
Prints how much memory SCons uses
before and after reading the SConscript files
and before and after building targets.
<P>
<DT>--debug=nomemoizer<DD>
A deprecated option preserved for backwards compatibility.
<P>
<DT>--debug=objects<DD>
Prints a list of the various objects
of the various classes used internally by SCons.
<P>
<DT>--debug=pdb<DD>
Re-run SCons under the control of the
pdb

Python debugger.
<P>
<DT>--debug=prepare<DD>
Print a line each time any target (internal or external)
is prepared for building.
<B>scons</B>

prints this for each target it considers, even if that
target is up to date (see also --debug=explain).
This can help debug problems with targets that aren't being
built; it shows whether
<B>scons</B>

is at least considering them or not.
<P>
<DT>--debug=presub<DD>
Print the raw command line used to build each target
before the construction environment variables are substituted.
Also shows which targets are being built by this command.
Output looks something like this:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$ scons --debug=presub
Building myprog.o with action(s):
  $SHCC $SHCFLAGS $SHCCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES
...

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>--debug=stacktrace<DD>
Prints an internal Python stack trace
when encountering an otherwise unexplained error.
<P>
<DT>--debug=stree<DD>
A synonym for the newer
<B>--tree=all,status</B>

option.
This will be deprecated in some future release
and ultimately removed.
<P>
<DT>--debug=time<DD>
Prints various time profiling information:
the time spent executing each individual build command;
the total build time (time SCons ran from beginning to end);
the total time spent reading and executing SConscript files;
the total time spent SCons itself spend running
(that is, not counting reading and executing SConscript files);
and both the total time spent executing all build commands
and the elapsed wall-clock time spent executing those build commands.
(When
<B>scons</B>

is executed without the
<B>-j</B>

option,
the elapsed wall-clock time will typically
be slightly longer than the total time spent
executing all the build commands,
due to the SCons processing that takes place
in between executing each command.
When
<B>scons</B>

is executed
<I>with</I>

the
<B>-j</B>

option,
and your build configuration allows good parallelization,
the elapsed wall-clock time should
be significantly smaller than the
total time spent executing all the build commands,
since multiple build commands and
intervening SCons processing
should take place in parallel.)
<P>
<DT>--debug=tree<DD>
A synonym for the newer
<B>--tree=all</B>

option.
This will be deprecated in some future release
and ultimately removed.
<P>
<DT>--diskcheck=<I>types</I>

<DD>
Enable specific checks for
whether or not there is a file on disk
where the SCons configuration expects a directory
(or vice versa),
and whether or not RCS or SCCS sources exist
when searching for source and include files.
The
<I>types</I>

argument can be set to:
<B>all</B>,

to enable all checks explicitly
(the default behavior);
<B>none</B>,

to disable all such checks;
<B>match</B>,

to check that files and directories on disk
match SCons' expected configuration;
<B>rcs</B>,

to check for the existence of an RCS source
for any missing source or include files;
<B>sccs</B>,

to check for the existence of an SCCS source
for any missing source or include files.
Multiple checks can be specified separated by commas;
for example,
<B>--diskcheck=sccs,rcs</B>

would still check for SCCS and RCS sources,
but disable the check for on-disk matches of files and directories.
Disabling some or all of these checks
can provide a performance boost for large configurations,
or when the configuration will check for files and/or directories
across networked or shared file systems,
at the slight increased risk of an incorrect build
or of not handling errors gracefully
(if include files really should be
found in SCCS or RCS, for example,
or if a file really does exist
where the SCons configuration expects a directory).
<P>
<DT>--duplicate=<I>ORDER</I>

<DD>
There are three ways to duplicate files in a build tree: hard links,
soft (symbolic) links and copies. The default behaviour of SCons is to
prefer hard links to soft links to copies. You can specify different
behaviours with this option.
<I>ORDER</I>

must be one of
<I>hard-soft-copy</I>

(the default),
<I>soft-hard-copy</I>,

<I>hard-copy</I>,

<I>soft-copy</I>

or
<I>copy</I>.

SCons will attempt to duplicate files using
the mechanisms in the specified order.
<P>




<P>
<DT>-f<I> file</I>, --file=<I>file</I>, --makefile=<I>file</I>, --sconstruct=<I>file</I>

<DD>
Use
<I>file</I>

as the initial SConscript file.
Multiple
<B>-f</B>

options may be specified,
in which case
<B>scons</B>

will read all of the specified files.
<P>
<DT>-h, --help<DD>
Print a local help message for this build, if one is defined in
the SConscript file(s), plus a line that describes the
<B>-H</B>

option for command-line option help.  If no local help message
is defined, prints the standard help message about command-line
options.  Exits after displaying the appropriate message.
<P>
<DT>-H, --help-options<DD>
Print the standard help message about command-line options and
exit.
<P>
<DT>-i, --ignore-errors<DD>
Ignore all errors from commands executed to rebuild files.
<P>
<DT>-I<I> directory</I>, --include-dir=<I>directory</I>

<DD>
Specifies a
<I>directory</I>

to search for
imported Python modules.  If several
<B>-I</B>

options
are used, the directories are searched in the order specified.
<P>
<DT>--implicit-cache<DD>
Cache implicit dependencies.
This causes
<B>scons</B>

to use the implicit (scanned) dependencies
from the last time it was run
instead of scanning the files for implicit dependencies.
This can significantly speed up SCons,
but with the following limitations:
<DT><DD>
<B>scons</B>

will not detect changes to implicit dependency search paths
(e.g.
<B>CPPPATH</B>, <B>LIBPATH</B>)

that would ordinarily
cause different versions of same-named files to be used.
<DT><DD>
<B>scons</B>

will miss changes in the implicit dependencies
in cases where a new implicit
dependency is added earlier in the implicit dependency search path
(e.g.
<B>CPPPATH</B>, <B>LIBPATH</B>)

than a current implicit dependency with the same name.
<P>
<DT>--implicit-deps-changed<DD>
Forces SCons to ignore the cached implicit dependencies. This causes the
implicit dependencies to be rescanned and recached. This implies
<B>--implicit-cache</B>.

<P>
<DT>--implicit-deps-unchanged<DD>
Force SCons to ignore changes in the implicit dependencies.
This causes cached implicit dependencies to always be used.
This implies
<B>--implicit-cache</B>.

<P>
<DT>--interactive<DD>
Starts SCons in interactive mode.
The SConscript files are read once and a
<B>scons&gt;&gt;&gt;</B>

prompt is printed.
Targets may now be rebuilt by typing commands at interactive prompt
without having to re-read the SConscript files
and re-initialize the dependency graph from scratch.
<P>
SCons interactive mode supports the following commands:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>build</B><I>[OPTIONS] [TARGETS] ...</I>

<DD>
Builds the specified
<I>TARGETS</I>

(and their dependencies)
with the specified
SCons command-line
<I>OPTIONS</I>.

<B>b</B>

and
<B>scons</B>

are synonyms.
<P>
The following SCons command-line options affect the
<B>build</B>

command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
--cache-debug=FILE
--cache-disable, --no-cache
--cache-force, --cache-populate
--cache-show
--debug=TYPE
-i, --ignore-errors
-j N, --jobs=N
-k, --keep-going
-n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
-Q
-s, --silent, --quiet
--taskmastertrace=FILE
--tree=OPTIONS

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT><DD>
Any other SCons command-line options that are specified

<B>make</B>.

<P>
<DT>--max-drift=<I>SECONDS</I>

<DD>
Set the maximum expected drift in the modification time of files to
<I>SECONDS</I>.

This value determines how long a file must be unmodified
before its cached content signature
will be used instead of
calculating a new content signature (MD5 checksum)
of the file's contents.
The default value is 2 days, which means a file must have a
modification time of at least two days ago in order to have its
cached content signature used.
A negative value means to never cache the content
signature and to ignore the cached value if there already is one. A value
of 0 means to always use the cached signature,
no matter how old the file is.
<P>
<DT>--md5-chunksize=<I>KILOBYTES</I>

<DD>
Set the block size used to compute MD5 signatures to
<I>KILOBYTES</I>.

This value determines the size of the chunks which are read in at once when
computing MD5 signatures.  Files below that size are fully stored in memory
before performing the signature computation while bigger files are read in
block-by-block. A huge block-size leads to high memory consumption while a very
small block-size slows down the build considerably.
<P>
The default value is to use a chunk size of 64 kilobytes, which should
be appropriate for most uses.

<DT>-q, --question<DD>
Do not run any commands, or print anything.  Just return an exit
status that is zero if the specified targets are already up to

reading SConscript files,
building targets
and entering directories.
Commands that are executed

<P>




<P>
<DT>--random<DD>
Build dependencies in a random order.  This is useful when
building multiple trees simultaneously with caching enabled,
to prevent multiple builds from simultaneously trying to build
or retrieve the same target files.
<P>
<DT>-s, --silent, --quiet<DD>
Silent.  Do not print commands that are executed to rebuild
target files.
Also suppresses SCons status messages.

<DT>-S, --no-keep-going, --stop<DD>
Ignored for compatibility with GNU
<B>make</B>.

<P>
<DT>--site-dir=<I>dir</I>

<DD>
Uses the named dir as the site dir rather than the default
<I>site_scons</I>

dirs.  This dir will get prepended to
<I>sys.path</I>,

the module
<I>dir</I>/site_init.py

will get loaded if it exists, and
<I>dir</I>/site_tools

will get added to the default toolpath.
<P>
The default set of
<I>site_scons</I>

dirs used when
<I>--site-dir</I>

is not specified depends on the system platform, as follows.  Note
that the directories are examined in the order given, from most
generic to most specific, so the last-executed site_init.py file is
the most specific one (which gives it the chance to override
everything else), and the dirs are prepended to the paths, again so
the last dir examined comes first in the resulting path.

<DT>--stack-size=<I>KILOBYTES</I>

<DD>
Set the size stack used to run threads to
<I>KILOBYTES</I>.

This value determines the stack size of the threads used to run jobs.
These are the threads that execute the actions of the builders for the
nodes that are out-of-date.
Note that this option has no effect unless the
<B>num_jobs</B>

option, which corresponds to -j and --jobs, is larger than one.  Using
a stack size that is too small may cause stack overflow errors.  This
usually shows up as segmentation faults that cause scons to abort
before building anything.  Using a stack size that is too large will
cause scons to use more memory than required and may slow down the entire
build process.
<P>
The default value is to use a stack size of 256 kilobytes, which should
be appropriate for most uses.  You should not need to increase this value
unless you encounter stack overflow errors.

<P>
<DT>--tree=status<DD>

<P>
<DT>--tree=prune<DD>
Prunes the tree to avoid repeating dependency information

<H3>Construction Environments</H3>

A construction environment is the basic means by which the SConscript
files communicate build information to
<B>scons</B>.

A new construction environment is created using the
<B>Environment</B>

function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment()

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Variables, called
<I>construction</I>

<I>variables</I>,

may be set in a construction environment
either by specifying them as keywords when the object is created
or by assigning them a value after the object is created:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(FOO = 'foo')
env['BAR'] = 'bar'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
As a convenience,
construction variables may also be set or modified by the
<I>parse_flags</I>

keyword argument, which applies the
<B>ParseFlags</B>

method (described below) to the argument value
after all other processing is completed.
This is useful either if the exact content of the flags is unknown
(for example, read from a control file)
or if the flags are distributed to a number of construction variables.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(parse_flags = '-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
This example adds 'include' to
<B>CPPPATH</B>,

'EBUG' to
<B>CPPDEFINES</B>,

and 'm' to
<B>LIBS</B>.

<P>
By default, a new construction environment is
initialized with a set of builder methods
and construction variables that are appropriate
for the current platform.
An optional platform keyword argument may be
used to specify that an environment should
be initialized for a different platform:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(platform = 'cygwin')
env = Environment(platform = 'os2')
env = Environment(platform = 'posix')
env = Environment(platform = 'win32')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate
construction variables in the environment
to use and generate file names with prefixes
and suffixes appropriate for the platform.
<P>
Note that the
<B>win32</B>

platform adds the
<B>SystemDrive</B>

and
<B>SystemRoot</B>

variables from the user's external environment
to the construction environment's
<B>ENV</B>

dictionary.
This is so that any executed commands
that use sockets to connect with other systems
(such as fetching source files from
external CVS repository specifications like
<B>:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net">anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net</A>:/cvsroot/scons</B>)

will work on Windows systems.
<P>
The platform argument may be function or callable object,
in which case the Environment() method
will call the specified argument to update
the new construction environment:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def my_platform(env):
    env['VAR'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(platform = my_platform)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Additionally, a specific set of tools
with which to initialize the environment
may be specified as an optional keyword argument:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(tools = ['msvc', 'lex'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Non-built-in tools may be specified using the toolpath argument:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(tools = ['default', 'foo'], toolpath = ['tools'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
This looks for a tool specification in tools/foo.py (as well as
using the ordinary default tools for the platform).  foo.py should
have two functions: generate(env, **kw) and exists(env).
The
<B>generate()</B>

function
modifies the passed-in environment
to set up variables so that the tool
can be executed;
it may use any keyword arguments
that the user supplies (see below)
to vary its initialization.
The
<B>exists()</B>

function should return a true
value if the tool is available.
Tools in the toolpath are used before
any of the built-in ones.  For example, adding gcc.py to the toolpath
would override the built-in gcc tool.
Also note that the toolpath is
stored in the environment for use
by later calls to
<B>Clone</B>()

and
<B>Tool</B>()

methods:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
base = Environment(toolpath=['custom_path'])
derived = base.Clone(tools=['custom_tool'])
derived.CustomBuilder()

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The elements of the tools list may also
be functions or callable objects,
in which case the Environment() method
will call the specified elements
to update the new construction environment:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def my_tool(env):
    env['XYZZY'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(tools = [my_tool])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The individual elements of the tools list
may also themselves be two-element lists of the form
(<I>toolname</I>, <I>kw_dict</I>).

SCons searches for the
<I>toolname</I>

specification file as described above, and
passes
<I>kw_dict</I>,

which must be a dictionary, as keyword arguments to the tool's
<B>generate</B>

function.
The
<B>generate</B>

function can use the arguments to modify the tool's behavior
by setting up the environment in different ways
or otherwise changing its initialization.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# in tools/my_tool.py:
def generate(env, **kw):
  # Sets MY_TOOL to the value of keyword argument 'arg1' or 1.
  env['MY_TOOL'] = kw.get('arg1', '1')
def exists(env):
  return 1

# in SConstruct:
env = Environment(tools = ['default', ('my_tool', {'arg1': 'abc'})],
                  toolpath=['tools'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The tool definition (i.e. my_tool()) can use the PLATFORM variable from
the environment it receives to customize the tool for different platforms.
<P>
If no tool list is specified, then SCons will auto-detect the installed
tools using the PATH variable in the ENV construction variable and the
platform name when the Environment is constructed. Changing the PATH
variable after the Environment is constructed will not cause the tools to
be redetected.
<P>
SCons supports the following tool specifications out of the box:

the GNU tools (e.g. gcc) are preferred by SCons,

<H3>Builder Methods</H3>

<P>
Build rules are specified by calling a construction
environment's builder methods.
The arguments to the builder methods are
<B>target</B>

(a list of targets to be built,
usually file names)
and
<B>source</B>

(a list of sources to be built,
usually file names).
<P>
Because long lists of file names
can lead to a lot of quoting,
<B>scons</B>

supplies a
<B>Split()</B>

global function
and a same-named environment method
that split a single string
into a list, separated on
strings of white-space characters.
(These are similar to the split() member function of Python strings
but work even if the input isn't a string.)
<P>
Like all Python arguments,
the target and source arguments to a builder method
can be specified either with or without
the &quot;target&quot; and &quot;source&quot; keywords.
When the keywords are omitted,
the target is first,
followed by the source.
The following are equivalent examples of calling the Program builder method:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Program('bar', ['bar.c', 'foo.c'])
env.Program('bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))

env.Program(target = 'bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', source = 'bar.c foo.c'.split())

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Target and source file names
that are not absolute path names
(that is, do not begin with
<B>/</B>

on POSIX systems
or
<B>\</B>

on Windows systems,
with or without
an optional drive letter)
are interpreted relative to the directory containing the
<B>SConscript</B>

file being read.
An initial
<B>#</B>

(hash mark)
on a path name means that the rest of the file name
is interpreted relative to
the directory containing
the top-level
<B>SConstruct</B>

file,
even if the
<B>#</B>

is followed by a directory separator character
(slash or backslash).
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# The comments describing the targets that will be built
# assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the
# a subdirectory named &quot;subdir&quot;.

# Builds the program &quot;subdir/foo&quot; from &quot;subdir/foo.c&quot;:
env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

# Builds the program &quot;/tmp/bar&quot; from &quot;subdir/bar.c&quot;:
env.Program('/tmp/bar', 'bar.c')

# An initial '#' or '#/' are equivalent; the following
# calls build the programs &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; (in the
# top-level SConstruct directory) from &quot;subdir/foo.c&quot; and
# &quot;subdir/bar.c&quot;, respectively:
env.Program('#foo', 'foo.c')
env.Program('#/bar', 'bar.c')

# Builds the program &quot;other/foo&quot; (relative to the top-level
# SConstruct directory) from &quot;subdir/foo.c&quot;:
env.Program('#other/foo', 'foo.c')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
When the target shares the same base name
as the source and only the suffix varies,
and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the target file type,
then the target argument may be omitted completely,
and
<B>scons</B>

will deduce the target file name from
the source file name.
The following examples all build the
executable program
<B>bar</B>

(on POSIX systems)
or
<B>bar.exe</B>

(on Windows systems)
from the bar.c source file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Program(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.c')
env.Program('bar', source = 'bar.c')
env.Program(source = 'bar.c')
env.Program('bar.c')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
As a convenience, a
<B>srcdir</B>

keyword argument may be specified
when calling a Builder.
When specified,
all source file strings that are not absolute paths
will be interpreted relative to the specified
<B>srcdir</B>.

The following example will build the
<B>build/prog</B>

(or
<B>build/prog.exe</B>

on Windows)
program from the files
<B>src/f1.c</B>

and
<B>src/f2.c</B>:

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Program('build/prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c'], srcdir='src')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
It is possible to override or add construction variables when calling a
builder method by passing additional keyword arguments.
These overridden or added
variables will only be in effect when building the target, so they will not
affect other parts of the build. For example, if you want to add additional
libraries for just one program:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
or generate a shared library with a non-standard suffix:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp',
                  SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx',
                  LIBSUFFIXES=['.ocx'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
(Note that both the $SHLIBSUFFIX and $LIBSUFFIXES variables must be set
if you want SCons to search automatically
for dependencies on the non-standard library names;
see the descriptions of these variables, below, for more information.)
<P>
It is also possible to use the
<I>parse_flags</I>

keyword argument in an override:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Program('hello', 'hello.c', parse_flags = '-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
This example adds 'include' to
<B>CPPPATH</B>,

'EBUG' to
<B>CPPDEFINES</B>,

and 'm' to
<B>LIBS</B>.

<P>
Although the builder methods defined by
<B>scons</B>

are, in fact,
methods of a construction environment object,
they may also be called without an explicit environment:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Program('hello', 'hello.c')
SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
In this case,
the methods are called internally using a default construction
environment that consists of the tools and values that
<B>scons</B>

has determined are appropriate for the local system.
<P>
Builder methods that can be called without an explicit
environment may be called from custom Python modules that you
import into an SConscript file by adding the following
to the Python module:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
from SCons.Script import *

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
All builder methods return a list-like object
containing Nodes that
represent the target or targets that will be built.
A
<I>Node</I>

is an internal SCons object
which represents
build targets or sources.
<P>
The returned Node-list object
can be passed to other builder methods as source(s)
or passed to any SCons function or method
where a filename would normally be accepted.
For example, if it were necessary
to add a specific
<B>-D</B>

flag when compiling one specific object file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
env.Program(source = ['foo.c', bar_obj_list, 'main.c'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Using a Node in this way
makes for a more portable build
by avoiding having to specify
a platform-specific object suffix
when calling the Program() builder method.
<P>
Note that Builder calls will automatically &quot;flatten&quot;
the source and target file lists,
so it's all right to have the bar_obj list
return by the StaticObject() call
in the middle of the source file list.
If you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by Builders
directly using Python,
you can either build the list by hand:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = ['begin.o'] + foo + ['middle.o'] + bar + ['end.o']
for object in objects:
    print str(object)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Or you can use the
<B>Flatten</B>()

function supplied by scons
to create a list containing just the Nodes,
which may be more convenient:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = Flatten(['begin.o', foo, 'middle.o', bar, 'end.o'])
for object in objects:
    print str(object)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Note also that because Builder calls return
a list-like object, not an actual Python list,
you should
<I>not</I>

use the Python
<B>+=</B>

operator to append Builder results to a Python list.
Because the list and the object are different types,
Python will not update the original list in place,
but will instead create a new Node-list object
containing the concatenation of the list
elements and the Builder results.
This will cause problems for any other Python variables
in your SCons configuration
that still hold on to a reference to the original list.
Instead, use the Python
<B>.extend()</B>

method to make sure the list is updated in-place.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
object_files = []

# Do NOT use += as follows:
#
#    object_files += Object('bar.c')
#
# It will not update the object_files list in place.
#
# Instead, use the .extend() method:
object_files.extend(Object('bar.c'))


</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The path name for a Node's file may be used
by passing the Node to the Python-builtin
<B>str()</B>

function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
print &quot;The path to bar_obj is:&quot;, str(bar_obj_list[0])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Note again that because the Builder call returns a list,
we have to access the first element in the list
<B>(bar_obj_list[0])</B>

to get at the Node that actually represents
the object file.
<P>
Builder calls support a
<B>chdir</B>

keyword argument that
specifies that the Builder's action(s)
should be executed
after changing directory.
If the
<B>chdir</B>

argument is
a string or a directory Node,
scons will change to the specified directory.
If the
<B>chdir</B>

is not a string or Node
and is non-zero,
then scons will change to the
target file's directory.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# scons will change to the &quot;sub&quot; subdirectory
# before executing the &quot;cp&quot; command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in',
            &quot;cp dir/foo.in dir/foo.out&quot;,
            chdir='sub')

# Because chdir is not a string, scons will change to the
# target's directory (&quot;sub/dir&quot;) before executing the
# &quot;cp&quot; command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in',
            &quot;cp foo.in foo.out&quot;,
            chdir=1)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Note that scons will
<I>not</I>

automatically modify
its expansion of
construction variables like
<B>$TARGET</B>

and
<B>$SOURCE</B>

when using the chdir
keyword argument--that is,
the expanded file names
will still be relative to
the top-level SConstruct directory,
and consequently incorrect
relative to the chdir directory.
If you use the chdir keyword argument,
you will typically need to supply a different
command line using
expansions like
<B>${TARGET.file}</B>

and
<B>${SOURCE.file}</B>

to use just the filename portion of the
targets and source.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

provides the following builder methods:
<P>














<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>CFile()<DD>
<DT>env.CFile()<DD>
Builds a C source file given a lex (<B>.l</B>)
or yacc (<B>.y</B>) input file.
The suffix specified by the <B>$CFILESUFFIX</B> construction variable
(<B>.c</B> by default)
is automatically added to the target
if it is not already present.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# builds foo.c
env.CFile(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.l')
# builds bar.c
env.CFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.y')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Command()<DD>
<DT>env.Command()<DD>
The <B>Command</B>() &quot;Builder&quot; is actually implemented
as a function that looks like a Builder,
but actually takes an additional argument of the action
from which the Builder should be made.
See the <B>Command</B>() function description
for the calling syntax and details.
<P>

<DT>CXXFile()<DD>
<DT>env.CXXFile()<DD>
Builds a C++ source file given a lex (<B>.ll</B>)
or yacc (<B>.yy</B>)
input file.
The suffix specified by the <B>$CXXFILESUFFIX</B> construction variable
(<B>.cc</B> by default)
is automatically added to the target
if it is not already present.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# builds foo.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'foo.cc', source = 'foo.ll')
# builds bar.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.yy')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>DVI()<DD>
<DT>env.DVI()<DD>
Builds a <B>.dvi</B> file
from a <B>.tex</B>,
<B>.ltx</B> or <B>.latex</B> input file.
If the source file suffix is <B>.tex</B>,
<B>scons</B>

will examine the contents of the file;
if the string
<B>\documentclass</B>

or
<B>\documentstyle</B>

is found, the file is assumed to be a LaTeX file and
the target is built by invoking the <B>$LATEXCOM</B> command line;
otherwise, the <B>$TEXCOM</B> command line is used.
If the file is a LaTeX file,
the
<B>DVI</B>()

builder method will also examine the contents
of the
<B>.aux</B>

file and invoke the <B>$BIBTEX</B> command line
if the string
<B>bibdata</B>

is found,
start <B>$MAKEINDEX</B> to generate an index if a
<B>.ind</B>

file is found
and will examine the contents
<B>.log</B>

file and re-run the <B>$LATEXCOM</B> command
if the log file says it is necessary.
<P>
The suffix <B>.dvi</B>
(hard-coded within TeX itself)
is automatically added to the target
if it is not already present.
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# builds from aaa.tex
env.DVI(target = 'aaa.dvi', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.dvi
env.DVI(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.ltx')
# builds from ccc.latex
env.DVI(target = 'ccc.dvi', source = 'ccc.latex')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Install()<DD>
<DT>env.Install()<DD>
Installs one or more source files or directories
in the specified target,
which must be a directory.
The names of the specified source files or directories
remain the same within the destination directory. The
sources may be given as a string or as a node returned by
a builder.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Install('/usr/local/bin', source = ['foo', 'bar'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>InstallAs()<DD>
<DT>env.InstallAs()<DD>
Installs one or more source files or directories
to specific names,
allowing changing a file or directory name
as part of the installation.
It is an error if the
target
and
source
arguments list different numbers of files or directories.
<P>

<DT>InstallVersionedLib()<DD>
<DT>env.InstallVersionedLib()<DD>
Installs a versioned shared library. The <B>$SHLIBVERSION</B>
construction variable should be defined in the environment
to confirm the version number in the library name.
The symlinks appropriate to the architecture will be generated.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.InstallAs(target = '/usr/local/bin/foo',
              source = 'foo_debug')
env.InstallAs(target = ['../lib/libfoo.a', '../lib/libbar.a'],
              source = ['libFOO.a', 'libBAR.a'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Jar()<DD>
<DT>env.Jar()<DD>
Builds a Java archive (<B>.jar</B>) file
from the specified list of sources.
Any directories in the source list
will be searched for <B>.class</B> files).
Any <B>.java</B> files in the source list
will be compiled  to <B>.class</B> files
by calling the <B>Java</B>() Builder.
<P>
If the <B>$JARCHDIR</B> value is set, the
<B>jar</B>

command will change to the specified directory using the
<B>-C</B>

option.
If <B>$JARCHDIR</B> is not set explicitly,
&amp;SCons; will use the top of any subdirectory tree
in which Java <B>.class</B>
were built by the <B>Java</B>() Builder.
<P>
If the contents any of the source files begin with the string
<B>Manifest-Version</B>,

the file is assumed to be a manifest
and is passed to the
<B>jar</B>

command with the
<B>m</B>

option set.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Jar(target = 'foo.jar', source = 'classes')

env.Jar(target = 'bar.jar',
        source = ['bar1.java', 'bar2.java'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Java()<DD>
<DT>env.Java()<DD>
Builds one or more Java class files.
The sources may be any combination of explicit
<B>.java</B> files,
or directory trees which will be scanned
for <B>.java</B> files.
<P>
SCons will parse each source <B>.java</B> file
to find the classes
(including inner classes)
defined within that file,
and from that figure out the
target <B>.class</B> files that will be created.
The class files will be placed underneath
the specified target directory.
<P>
SCons will also search each Java file
for the Java package name,
which it assumes can be found on a line
beginning with the string
<B>package</B>

in the first column;
the resulting <B>.class</B> files
will be placed in a directory reflecting
the specified package name.
For example,
the file
<B>Foo.java</B>

defining a single public
<I>Foo</I>

class and
containing a package name of
<I>sub.dir</I>

will generate a corresponding
<B>sub/dir/Foo.class</B>

class file.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['src1', 'src2'])
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['File1.java', 'File2.java'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Java source files can use the native encoding for the underlying OS.
Since SCons compiles in simple ASCII mode by default,
the compiler will generate warnings about unmappable characters,
which may lead to errors as the file is processed further.
In this case, the user must specify the <B>LANG</B>
environment variable to tell the compiler what encoding is used.
For portibility, it's best if the encoding is hard-coded
so that the compile will work if it is done on a system
with a different encoding.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment()
env['ENV']['LANG'] = 'en_GB.UTF-8'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>JavaH()<DD>
<DT>env.JavaH()<DD>
Builds C header and source files for
implementing Java native methods.
The target can be either a directory
in which the header files will be written,
or a header file name which
will contain all of the definitions.
The source can be the names of <B>.class</B> files,
the names of <B>.java</B> files
to be compiled into <B>.class</B> files
by calling the <B>Java</B>() builder method,
or the objects returned from the
<B>Java</B>()

builder method.
<P>
If the construction variable
<B>$JAVACLASSDIR</B>

is set, either in the environment
or in the call to the
<B>JavaH</B>()

builder method itself,
then the value of the variable
will be stripped from the
beginning of any <B>.class</B> file names.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# builds java_native.h
classes = env.Java(target = 'classdir', source = 'src')
env.JavaH(target = 'java_native.h', source = classes)

# builds include/package_foo.h and include/package_bar.h
env.JavaH(target = 'include',

<P>

<DT>Library()<DD>
<DT>env.Library()<DD>
A synonym for the
<B>StaticLibrary</B>()

builder method.
<P>

<DT>LoadableModule()<DD>
<DT>env.LoadableModule()<DD>
On most systems,
this is the same as
<B>SharedLibrary</B>().

On Mac OS X (Darwin) platforms,
this creates a loadable module bundle.
<P>

<DT>M4()<DD>
<DT>env.M4()<DD>
Builds an output file from an M4 input file.
This uses a default <B>$M4FLAGS</B> value of
<B>-E</B>,

which considers all warnings to be fatal
and stops on the first warning
when using the GNU version of m4.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.M4(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.c.m4')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Moc()<DD>
<DT>env.Moc()<DD>
Builds an output file from a moc input file. Moc input files are either
header files or cxx files. This builder is only available after using the
tool 'qt'. See the <B>$QTDIR</B> variable for more information.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Moc('foo.h') # generates moc_foo.cc

<P>

<DT>MSVSProject()<DD>
<DT>env.MSVSProject()<DD>
Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio project file,
and by default builds a solution file as well.
<P>
This builds a Visual Studio project file, based on the version of
Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed version,
or the version specified by
<B>$MSVS_VERSION</B>

in the Environment constructor).
For Visual Studio 6, it will generate a
<B>.dsp</B>

file.
For Visual Studio 7 (.NET) and later versions, it will generate a
<B>.vcproj</B>

file.
<P>
By default,
this also generates a solution file
for the specified project,
a
<B>.dsw</B>

file for Visual Studio 6
or a
<B>.sln</B>

file for Visual Studio 7 (.NET).
This behavior may be disabled by specifying
<B>auto_build_solution=0</B>

when you call
<B>MSVSProject</B>(),

in which case you presumably want to
build the solution file(s)
by calling the
<B>MSVSSolution</B>()

Builder (see below).
<P>
The <B>MSVSProject</B>() builder
takes several lists of filenames
to be placed into the project file.
These are currently limited to
<B>srcs</B>,

<B>incs</B>,

<B>localincs</B>,

<B>resources</B>,

and
<B>misc</B>.

These are pretty self-explanatory, but it should be noted that these
lists are added to the <B>$SOURCES</B> construction variable as strings,
NOT as SCons File Nodes.  This is because they represent file
names to be added to the project file, not the source files used to
build the project file.
<P>
The above filename lists are all optional,
although at least one must be specified
for the resulting project file to be non-empty.
<P>
In addition to the above lists of values,
the following values may be specified:
<P>
<B>target</B>:

The name of the target
<B>.dsp</B>

or
<B>.vcproj</B>

file.
The correct
suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used,
but the
<B>$MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX</B>

construction variable
will be defined to the correct value (see example below).
<P>
<B>variant</B>:

The name of this particular variant.
For Visual Studio 7 projects,
this can also be a list of variant names.
These are typically things like &quot;Debug&quot; or &quot;Release&quot;, but really
can be anything you want.
For Visual Studio 7 projects,
they may also specify a target platform
separated from the variant name by a
<B>|</B>

(vertical pipe)
character:
<B>Debug|Xbox</B>.

The default target platform is Win32.
Multiple calls to
<B>MSVSProject</B>()

with different variants are allowed;
all variants will be added to the project file with their appropriate
build targets and sources.
<P>
<B>buildtarget</B>:

An optional string, node, or list of strings or nodes
(one per build variant), to tell the Visual Studio debugger
what output target to use in what build variant.
The number of
<B>buildtarget</B>

entries must match the number of
<B>variant</B>

entries.
<P>
<B>runfile</B>:

The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later
will run and debug.
This appears as the value of the
<B>Output</B>

field in the resutling Visual Studio project file.
If this is not specified,
the default is the same as the specified
<B>buildtarget</B>

value.
<P>
Note that because &amp;SCons; always executes its build commands
from the directory in which the <B>SConstruct</B> file is located,
if you generate a project file in a different directory
than the <B>SConstruct</B> directory,
users will not be able to double-click
on the file name in compilation error messages
displayed in the Visual Studio console output window.
This can be remedied by adding the
Visual C/C++
<B>/FC</B>

compiler option to the <B>$CCFLAGS</B>  variable
so that the compiler will print
the full path name of any
files that cause compilation errors.

<DT>MSVSSolution()<DD>
<DT>env.MSVSSolution()<DD>
Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.
<P>
This builds a Visual Studio solution file,
based on the version of Visual Studio that is configured
(either the latest installed version,
or the version specified by
<B>$MSVS_VERSION</B>

in the construction environment).
For Visual Studio 6, it will generate a
<B>.dsw</B>

file.
For Visual Studio 7 (.NET), it will
generate a
<B>.sln</B>

file.
<P>
The following values must be specified:
<P>
<B>target</B>:

The name of the target .dsw or .sln file.  The correct
suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the value
<B>$MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX</B>

will be defined to the correct value (see example below).
<P>
<B>variant</B>:

The name of this particular variant, or a list of variant
names (the latter is only supported for MSVS 7 solutions). These are
typically things like &quot;Debug&quot; or &quot;Release&quot;, but really can be anything
you want. For MSVS 7 they may also specify target platform, like this
&quot;Debug|Xbox&quot;. Default platform is Win32.
<P>
<B>projects</B>:

A list of project file names, or Project nodes returned by calls to the
<B>MSVSProject</B>()

Builder,
to be placed into the solution file.
It should be noted that these file names are NOT added to the $SOURCES
environment variable in form of files, but rather as strings.   This
is because they represent file names to be added to the solution file,
not the source files used to build the solution file.

<DT>Package()<DD>
<DT>env.Package()<DD>
Builds software distribution packages.
Packages consist of files to install and packaging information.
The former may be specified with the <I>source</I> parameter and may be left out,
in which case the &amp;FindInstalledFiles; function will collect
all files that have an <B>Install</B>() or <B>InstallAs</B>() Builder attached.
If the <I>target</I> is not specified
it will be deduced from additional information given to this Builder.
<P>
The packaging information is specified
with the help of construction variables documented below.
This information is called a tag to stress that
some of them can also be attached to files with the &amp;Tag; function.
The mandatory ones will complain if they were not specified.
They vary depending on chosen target packager.
<P>
The target packager may be selected with the &quot;PACKAGETYPE&quot; command line
option or with the <B>$PACKAGETYPE</B> construction variable. Currently
the following packagers available:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;msi&nbsp;-&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Installer
<BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;rpm&nbsp;-&nbsp;Redhat&nbsp;Package&nbsp;Manger

<DT>PCH()<DD>
<DT>env.PCH()<DD>
Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header.
Calling this builder method
returns a list of two targets: the PCH as the first element, and the object
file as the second element. Normally the object file is ignored.
This builder method is only
provided when Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the compiler.
The PCH builder method is generally used in
conjuction with the PCH construction variable to force object files to use
the precompiled header:

<DT>POInit()<DD>
<DT>env.POInit()<DD>
This builder belongs to &amp;t-link-msginit; tool. The builder initializes missing

<I>you</I>should<I>not</I>use<I></I><B>POInit</B>()and<I>use</I><B>POUpdate</B><I>()</I>

<DT>POTUpdate()<DD>
<DT>env.POTUpdate()<DD>
The builder belongs to &amp;t-link-xgettext; tool. The builder updates target
<B>POT</B> file if exists or creates one if it doesn't. The node is
not built by default (i.e. it is <B>Ignore</B>d from
<B>'.'</B>), but only on demand (i.e.  when given
<B>POT</B> file is required or when special alias is invoked). This
builder adds its targe node (<B>messages.pot</B>, say) to a
special alias (<B>pot-update</B> by default, see
<B>$POTUPDATE_ALIAS</B>) so you can update/create them easily with
<B>scons pot-update</B>. The file is not written until there is no
real change in internationalized messages (or in comments that enter
<B>POT</B> file). 
<P>
&lt;note&gt; 
You may see <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+xgettext">xgettext</A>(1)</B> being invoked by the
&amp;t-link-xgettext; tool even if there is no real change in internationalized
messages (so the <B>POT</B> file is not being updated).  This
happens every time  a source file has changed. In such case we invoke
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+xgettext">xgettext</A>(1)</B> and compare its output with the content of
<B>POT</B> file to decide whether the file should be updated or
not.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/note&gt;
<P>
<I>Example 1.</I>

Let's create <B>po/</B> directory and place following
<B>SConstruct</B> script there:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
  # SConstruct in 'po/' subdir
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(['foo'], ['../a.cpp', '../b.cpp'])
  env.POTUpdate(['bar'], ['../c.cpp', '../d.cpp'])

<DT>SharedLibrary()<DD>
<DT>env.SharedLibrary()<DD>
Builds a shared library
(<B>.so</B> on a POSIX system,
<B>.dll</B> on Windows)
given one or more object files
or C, C++, D or Fortran source files.
If any source files are given,
then they will be automatically
compiled to object files.
The static library prefix and suffix (if any)
are automatically added to the target.
The target library file prefix
(specified by the <B>$SHLIBPREFIX</B> construction variable;
by default, <B>lib</B> on POSIX systems,
nothing on Windows systems)
and suffix
(specified by the <B>$SHLIBSUFFIX</B> construction variable;
by default, <B>.dll</B> on Windows systems,
<B>.so</B> on POSIX systems)
are automatically added to the target if not already present.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
On Windows systems, the
<B>SharedLibrary</B>()

builder method will always build an import
(<B>.lib</B>) library
in addition to the shared (<B>.dll</B>) library,
adding a <B>.lib</B> library with the same basename
if there is not already a <B>.lib</B> file explicitly
listed in the targets.
<P>
Any object files listed in the
<B>source</B>

must have been built for a shared library
(that is, using the
<B>SharedObject</B>()

builder method).
<B>scons</B>

will raise an error if there is any mismatch.
<P>
On some platforms, there is a distinction between a shared library
(loaded automatically by the system to resolve external references)
and a loadable module (explicitly loaded by user action).
For maximum portability, use the <B>LoadableModule</B>() builder for the latter.
<P>
When the <B>$SHLIBVERSION</B> construction variable is defined a versioned
shared library is created. This modifies the <B>$SHLINKFLAGS</B> as required,
adds the version number to the library name, and creates the symlinks that
are needed. <B>$SHLIBVERSION</B> needs to be of the form X.Y.Z, where X
and Y are numbers, and Z is a number but can also contain letters to designate
alpha, beta, or release candidate patch levels.
<P>
This builder may create multiple links to the library. On a POSIX system,
for the shared library libbar.so.2.3.1, the links created would be
libbar.so, libbar.so.2, and libbar.so.2.3; on a Darwin (OSX) system
the library would be libbar.2.3.1.dylib and the link would be
libbar.dylib.
<P>
On Windows systems, specifying
<B>register=1</B>

will cause the <B>.dll</B> to be
registered after it is built using REGSVR32.
The command that is run
(&quot;regsvr32&quot; by default) is determined by <B>$REGSVR</B> construction
variable, and the flags passed are determined by <B>$REGSVRFLAGS</B>.  By
default, <B>$REGSVRFLAGS</B> includes the <B>/s</B> option,
to prevent dialogs from popping
up and requiring user attention when it is run.  If you change
<B>$REGSVRFLAGS</B>, be sure to include the <B>/s</B> option.
For example,

<P>

<DT>SharedObject()<DD>
<DT>env.SharedObject()<DD>
Builds an object file for
inclusion in a shared library.
Source files must have one of the same set of extensions
specified above for the
<B>StaticObject</B>()

builder method.
On some platforms building a shared object requires additional
compiler option
(e.g. <B>-fPIC</B> for gcc)
in addition to those needed to build a
normal (static) object, but on some platforms there is no difference between a
shared object and a normal (static) one. When there is a difference, SCons
will only allow shared objects to be linked into a shared library, and will
use a different suffix for shared objects. On platforms where there is no
difference, SCons will allow both normal (static)
and shared objects to be linked into a
shared library, and will use the same suffix for shared and normal
(static) objects.
The target object file prefix
(specified by the <B>$SHOBJPREFIX</B> construction variable;
by default, the same as <B>$OBJPREFIX</B>)
and suffix
(specified by the <B>$SHOBJSUFFIX</B> construction variable)
are automatically added to the target if not already present.
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DT>StaticLibrary()<DD>
<DT>env.StaticLibrary()<DD>
Builds a static library given one or more object files
or C, C++, D or Fortran source files.
If any source files are given,
then they will be automatically

<DT>Substfile()<DD>
<DT>env.Substfile()<DD>
The <B>Substfile</B>() builder generates a single text file
by concatenating the source files.
Nested lists of sources are flattened. 
<B>$LINESEPARATOR</B> is used to separate the source files;
see the description of <B>Textfile</B>() for details.
<P>
If a single source file is present with an <B>.in</B> suffix,
the suffix is stripped and the remainder is used as the default target name.
<P>
The prefix and suffix specified by the <B>$SUBSTFILEPREFIX</B>
and <B>$SUBSTFILESUFFIX</B> construction variables
(the null string by default in both cases)
are automatically added to the target if they are not already present.
<P>
If a construction variable named <B>$SUBST_DICT</B> is present,
it may be either a Python dictionary or a sequence of (key,value) tuples.
If the former,
the dictionary is converted into a list of tuples in an arbitrary order,
so if one key is a prefix of another key
or if one substitution could be further expanded by another subsitition,
it is unpredictible whether the expansion will occur.
<P>
Any occurences in the source of a key
are replaced by the corresponding value,
which may be a Python callable function or a string.
If a value is a function,
it is first called (with no arguments) to produce a string.
The string is <I>subst</I>-expanded
and the result replaces the key.

<DT>Translate()<DD>
<DT>env.Translate()<DD>
This pseudo-builder belongs to &amp;t-link-gettext; toolset. The builder extracts
internationalized messages from source files, updates <B>POT</B>
template (if necessary) and then updates <B>PO</B> translations (if
necessary). If <B>$POAUTOINIT</B> is set, missing <B>PO</B> files
will be automatically created (i.e. without translator person intervention).
The variables <B>$LINGUAS_FILE</B> and <B>$POTDOMAIN</B> are taken into
acount too. All other construction variables used by <B>POTUpdate</B>(), and
<B>POUpdate</B>() work here too.
<P>
<I>Example</I>1<I>.</I>

The simplest way is to specify input files and output languages inline in
a SCons script when invoking <B>Translate</B>()

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

If you wish, you may also stick to conventional style known from

<DT><DD>
The last approach is perhaps the recommended one. It allows easily split
internationalization/localization onto separate SCons scripts, where a script
in source tree is responsible for translations (from sources to
<B>PO</B> files) and script(s) under variant directories are
responsible for compilation of <B>PO</B> to <B>MO</B>
files to and for installation of <B>MO</B> files. The &quot;gluing
factor&quot; synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of
<B>LINGUAS</B> file.  Note, that the updated
<B>POT</B> and <B>PO</B> files are usually going to be
committed back to the repository, so they must be updated within the source
directory (and not in variant directories). Additionaly, the file listing of
<B>po/</B> directory contains <B>LINGUAS</B> file,
so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they may work with the
project in their usual way.
<P>
<I>Example</I>3<I>.</I>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

with <B>build</B> being variant directory. Write the top-level
<B>SConstruct</B> script as follows

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
  # SConstruct
  env = Environment( tools = [&quot;default&quot;, &quot;gettext&quot;] )

  SConscript('src/po/SConscript.i18n', exports = 'env')
  SConscript('build/po/SConscript', exports = 'env')

the <B>src/po/SConscript.i18n</B> as

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

  # src/po/SConscript.i18n
  Import('env')
  env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE=1, XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../'])

and the <B>src/po/SConscript</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
  # src/po/SConscript

  env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

</PRE>

Such setup produces <B>POT</B> and <B>PO</B> files
under source tree in <B>src/po/</B> and binary
<B>MO</B> files under variant tree in
<B>build/po/</B>. This way the <B>POT</B> and
<B>PO</B> files are separated from other output files, which must
not be committed back to source repositories (e.g. <B>MO</B>
files).
<P>
&lt;note&gt;
In above example, the <B>PO</B> files are not updated,
nor created automatically when you issue <B>scons '.'</B> command.
The files must be updated (created) by hand via <B>scons
po-update</B> and then <B>MO</B> files can be compiled by
running <B>scons '.'</B>.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/note&gt;

All
targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources.
An explicit dependency can
be specified using the
<B>Depends</B>

method of a construction environment (see below).
<P>
In addition,
<B>scons</B>

automatically scans
source files for various programming languages,
so the dependencies do not need to be specified explicitly.
By default, SCons can
C source files,
C++ source files,
Fortran source files with
<B>.F</B>

(POSIX systems only),
<B>.fpp,</B>

or
<B>.FPP</B>

file extensions,
and assembly language files with
<B>.S</B>

(POSIX systems only),
<B>.spp,</B>

or
<B>.SPP</B>

files extensions
for C preprocessor dependencies.
SCons also has default support
for scanning D source files,
You can also write your own Scanners
to add support for additional source file types.
These can be added to the default
Scanner object used by the
<B>Object</B>(),

<B>StaticObject</B>(),

and
<B>SharedObject</B>()

Builders by adding them
to the
<B>SourceFileScanner</B>

object.
See the section &quot;Scanner Objects&quot;
below, for more information about
defining your own Scanner objects
and using the
<B>SourceFileScanner</B>

object.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Methods and Functions to Do Things</H3>

In addition to Builder methods,
<B>scons</B>

provides a number of other construction environment methods
and global functions to
manipulate the build configuration.
<P>
Usually, a construction environment method
and global function with the same name both exist
so that you don't have to remember whether
to a specific bit of functionality
must be called with or without a construction environment.
In the following list,
if you call something as a global function
it looks like:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Function(<I>arguments</I>)

</PRE>

</DL>


and if you call something through a construction
environment it looks like:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Function(<I>arguments</I>)

</PRE>

</DL>


If you can call the functionality in both ways,
then both forms are listed.
<P>
Global functions may be called from custom Python modules that you
import into an SConscript file by adding the following
to the Python module:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
from SCons.Script import *

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Except where otherwise noted,
the same-named
construction environment method
and global function
provide the exact same functionality.
The only difference is that,
where appropriate,
calling the functionality through a construction environment will
substitute construction variables into
any supplied strings.
For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(FOO = 'foo')
Default('$FOO')
env.Default('$FOO')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
In the above example,
the first call to the global
<B>Default()</B>

function will actually add a target named
<B>$FOO</B>

to the list of default targets,
while the second call to the
<B>env.Default()</B>

construction environment method
will expand the value
and add a target named
<B>foo</B>

to the list of default targets.
For more on construction variable expansion,
see the next section on
construction variables.
<P>
Construction environment methods
and global functions supported by
<B>scons</B>

include:

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Action(<I>action</I>, [<I>cmd/str/fun</I>, [<I>var</I>, ...]] [option=<I>value</I>, ...])

<DD>
Creates an Action object for
the specified
<I>action</I>.

See the section &quot;Action Objects,&quot;
below, for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.
<P>
Note that the
<B>env.Action</B>()

form of the invocation will expand
construction variables in any argument strings,
including the
<I>action</I>

argument, at the time it is called
using the construction variables in the
<I>env</I>

construction environment through which
<B>env.Action</B>()

was called.
The
<B>Action</B>()

form delays all variable expansion
until the Action object is actually used.

<DT>AddMethod(<I>object</I>, <I>function</I>, [<I>name</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.AddMethod(<I>function</I>, [<I>name</I>])

<DD>
When called with the
<B>AddMethod</B>()

form,
adds the specified
<I>function</I>

to the specified
<I>object</I>

as the specified method
<I>name</I>.

When called with the
<B>env.AddMethod</B>()

form,
adds the specified
<I>function</I>

to the construction environment
<I>env</I>

as the specified method
<I>name</I>.

In both cases, if
<I>name</I>

is omitted or
<B>None</B>,

the name of the
specified
<I>function</I>

itself is used for the method name.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# Note that the first argument to the function to

<P>

<DT>AddOption(<I>arguments</I>)

<DD>
This function adds a new command-line option to be recognized.
The specified
<I>arguments</I>

are the same as supported by the standard Python
<B>optparse.add_option</B>()

method (with a few additional capabilities noted below);
see the documentation for
<B>optparse</B>

for a thorough discussion of its option-processing capabities.
<P>
In addition to the arguments and values supported by the
<B>optparse.add_option</B>()

method,
the SCons
<B>AddOption</B>()

function allows you to set the
<B>nargs</B>

keyword value to
<B>'?'</B>

(a string with just the question mark)
to indicate that the specified long option(s) take(s) an
<I>optional</I>

argument.
When
<B>nargs = '?'</B>

is passed to the
<B>AddOption</B>()

function, the
<B>const</B>

keyword argument
may be used to supply the &quot;default&quot;
value that should be used when the
option is specified on the command line
without an explicit argument.
<P>
If no
<B>default=</B>

keyword argument is supplied when calling
<B>AddOption</B>(),

the option will have a default value of
<B>None</B>.

<P>
Once a new command-line option has been added with
<B>AddOption</B>(),

the option value may be accessed using
<B>GetOption</B>()

or
<B>env.GetOption</B>().

The value may also be set, using
<B>SetOption</B>()

or
<B>env.SetOption</B>(),

if conditions in a
<B>SConscript</B>

require overriding any default value.
Note, however, that a
value specified on the command line will
<I>always</I>

override a value set by any SConscript file.
<P>
Any specified
<B>help=</B>

strings for the new option(s)
will be displayed by the
<B>-H</B>

or
<B>-h</B>

options
(the latter only if no other help text is
specified in the SConscript files).
The help text for the local options specified by
<B>AddOption</B>()

will appear below the SCons options themselves,
under a separate
<B>Local Options</B>

heading.
The options will appear in the help text
in the order in which the
<B>AddOption</B>()

calls occur.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DT>AddPostAction(<I>target</I>, <I>action</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.AddPostAction(<I>target</I>, <I>action</I>)

<DD>
Arranges for the specified
<I>action</I>

to be performed
after the specified
<I>target</I>

has been built.
The specified action(s) may be
an Action object, or anything that
can be converted into an Action object
(see below).
<P>
When multiple targets are supplied,
the action may be called multiple times,
once after each action that generates
one or more targets in the list.
<P>

<DT>AddPreAction(<I>target</I>, <I>action</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.AddPreAction(<I>target</I>, <I>action</I>)

<DD>
Arranges for the specified
<I>action</I>

to be performed
before the specified
<I>target</I>

is built.
The specified action(s) may be
an Action object, or anything that
can be converted into an Action object
(see below).
<P>
When multiple targets are specified,
the action(s) may be called multiple times,
once before each action that generates
one or more targets in the list.
<P>
Note that if any of the targets are built in multiple steps,
the action will be invoked just
before the &quot;final&quot; action that specifically
generates the specified target(s).
For example, when building an executable program
from a specified source
<B>.c</B>

file via an intermediate object file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
foo = Program('foo.c')
AddPreAction(foo, 'pre_action')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The specified
<B>pre_action</B>

would be executed before
<B>scons</B>

calls the link command that actually
generates the executable program binary
<B>foo</B>,

not before compiling the
<B>foo.c</B>

file into an object file.
<P>

<DT>Alias(<I>alias</I>, [<I>targets</I>, [<I>action</I>]])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Alias(<I>alias</I>, [<I>targets</I>, [<I>action</I>]])

<DD>
Creates one or more phony targets that
expand to one or more other targets.
An optional
<I>action</I>

(command)
or list of actions
can be specified that will be executed
whenever the any of the alias targets are out-of-date.
Returns the Node object representing the alias,
which exists outside of any file system.
This Node object, or the alias name,
may be used as a dependency of any other target,
including another alias.
<B>Alias</B>()

can be called multiple times for the same
alias to add additional targets to the alias,
or additional actions to the list for this alias.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Alias('install')
Alias('install', '/usr/bin')
Alias(['install', 'install-lib'], '/usr/local/lib')

env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/lib'])
env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/man'])

env.Alias('update', ['file1', 'file2'], &quot;update_database $SOURCES&quot;)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>AllowSubstExceptions([<I>exception</I>, ...])

<DD>
Specifies the exceptions that will be allowed
when expanding construction variables.
By default,
any construction variable expansions that generate a
<B>NameError</B>

or
<B>IndexError</B>

exception will expand to a
<B>''</B>

(a null string) and not cause scons to fail.
All exceptions not in the specified list
will generate an error message
and terminate processing.
<P>
If
<B>AllowSubstExceptions</B>()

is called multiple times,
each call completely overwrites the previous list
of allowed exceptions.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# Requires that all construction variable names exist.
# (You may wish to do this if you want to enforce strictly
# that all construction variables must be defined before use.)
AllowSubstExceptions()

# Also allow a string containing a zero-division expansion
# like '${1 / 0}' to evalute to ''.
AllowSubstExceptions(IndexError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>AlwaysBuild(<I>target</I>, ...)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.AlwaysBuild(<I>target</I>, ...)

<DD>
Marks each given
<I>target</I>

so that it is always assumed to be out of date,
and will always be rebuilt if needed.
Note, however, that
<B>AlwaysBuild</B>()

does not add its target(s) to the default target list,
so the targets will only be built
if they are specified on the command line,
or are a dependent of a target specified on the command line--but
they will
<I>always</I>

be built if so specified.
Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call to
<B>AlwaysBuild</B>().

<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.Append(key=<I>val</I>, [...])

<DD>
Appends the specified keyword arguments
to the end of construction variables in the environment.
If the Environment does not have
the specified construction variable,
it is simply added to the environment.
If the values of the construction variable
and the keyword argument are the same type,
then the two values will be simply added together.
Otherwise, the construction variable
and the value of the keyword argument
are both coerced to lists,
and the lists are added together.
(See also the Prepend method, below.)
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Append(CCFLAGS = ' -g', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.AppendENVPath(<I>name</I>, <I>newpath</I>, [<I>envname</I>, <I>sep</I>, <I>delete_existing</I>])

<DD>
This appends new path elements to the given path in the
specified external environment
(<B>ENV</B>

by default).
This will only add
any particular path once (leaving the last one it encounters and
ignoring the rest, to preserve path order),
and to help assure this,
will normalize all paths (using
<B>os.path.normpath</B>

and
<B>os.path.normcase</B>).

This can also handle the
case where the given old path variable is a list instead of a
string, in which case a list will be returned instead of a string.
<P>
If 
<I>delete_existing</I>

is 0, then adding a path that already exists
will not move it to the end; it will stay where it is in the list.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
print 'before:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.AppendENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print 'after:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']

yields:
before: /foo:/biz
after: /biz:/foo/bar:/foo

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.AppendUnique(key=<I>val</I>, [...], delete_existing=<I>0)</I>

<DD>
Appends the specified keyword arguments
to the end of construction variables in the environment.
If the Environment does not have
the specified construction variable,
it is simply added to the environment.
If the construction variable being appended to is a list,
then any value(s) that already exist in the
construction variable will
<I>not</I>

be added again to the list.
However, if delete_existing is 1, 
existing matching values are removed first, so
existing values in the arg list move to the end of the list.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.AppendUnique(CCFLAGS = '-g', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.BitKeeper()

<DD>
A factory function that
returns a Builder object
to be used to fetch source files
using BitKeeper.
The returned Builder
is intended to be passed to the
<B>SourceCode</B>()

function.
<P>
This function is deprecated.  For details, see the entry for the
<B>SourceCode</B>()

function.

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.BuildDir(<I>build_dir</I>, <I>src_dir</I>, [<I>duplicate</I>])

<DD>
Deprecated synonyms for
<B>VariantDir</B>()

and
<B>env.VariantDir</B>().

The
<I>build_dir</I>

argument becomes the
<I>variant_dir</I>

argument of
<B>VariantDir</B>()

or
<B>env.VariantDir</B>().

<P>

<DT>Builder(<I>action</I>, [<I>arguments</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Builder(<I>action</I>, [<I>arguments</I>])

<DD>
Creates a Builder object for
the specified
<I>action</I>.

See the section &quot;Builder Objects,&quot;
below, for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.
<P>
Note that the
<B>env.Builder</B>()

form of the invocation will expand
construction variables in any arguments strings,
including the
<I>action</I>

argument,
at the time it is called
using the construction variables in the
<I>env</I>

construction environment through which
<B>env.Builder</B>()

was called.
The
<B>Builder</B>()

form delays all variable expansion
until after the Builder object is actually called.
<P>

<DT>CacheDir(<I>cache_dir</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.CacheDir(<I>cache_dir</I>)

<DD>
Specifies that
<B>scons</B>

will maintain a cache of derived files in
<I>cache_dir</I>.

The derived files in the cache will be shared
among all the builds using the same
<B>CacheDir</B>()

call.
Specifying a
<I>cache_dir</I>

of
<B>None</B>

disables derived file caching.
<P>
Calling
<B>env.CacheDir</B>()

will only affect targets built
through the specified construction environment.
Calling
<B>CacheDir</B>()

sets a global default
that will be used by all targets built
through construction environments
that do
<I>not</I>

have an
<B>env.CacheDir</B>()

specified.
<P>
When a
<B>CacheDir</B>()

is being used and
<B>scons</B>

finds a derived file that needs to be rebuilt,
it will first look in the cache to see if a
derived file has already been built
from identical input files and an identical build action
(as incorporated into the MD5 build signature).
If so,
<B>scons</B>

will retrieve the file from the cache.
If the derived file is not present in the cache,
<B>scons</B>

will rebuild it and
then place a copy of the built file in the cache
(identified by its MD5 build signature),
so that it may be retrieved by other
builds that need to build the same derived file
from identical inputs.
<P>
Use of a specified
<B>CacheDir</B>()

may be disabled for any invocation
by using the
<B>--cache-disable</B>

option.
<P>
If the
<B>--cache-force</B>

option is used,
<B>scons</B>

will place a copy of
<I>all</I>

derived files in the cache,
even if they already existed
and were not built by this invocation.
This is useful to populate a cache
the first time
<B>CacheDir</B>()

is added to a build,
or after using the
<B>--cache-disable</B>

option.
<P>
When using
<B>CacheDir</B>(),

<B>scons</B>

will report,
&quot;Retrieved `file' from cache,&quot;
unless the
<B>--cache-show</B>

option is being used.
When the
<B>--cache-show</B>

option is used,
<B>scons</B>

will print the action that
<I>would</I>

have been used to build the file,
without any indication that
the file was actually retrieved from the cache.
This is useful to generate build logs
that are equivalent regardless of whether
a given derived file has been built in-place
or retrieved from the cache.
<P>
The
<B>NoCache</B>()

method can be used to disable caching of specific files.  This can be
useful if inputs and/or outputs of some tool are impossible to
predict or prohibitively large.
<P>

<DT>Clean(<I>targets</I>, <I>files_or_dirs</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Clean(<I>targets</I>, <I>files_or_dirs</I>)

<DD>
This specifies a list of files or directories which should be removed
whenever the targets are specified with the
<B>-c</B>

command line option.
The specified targets may be a list
or an individual target.
Multiple calls to
<B>Clean</B>()

are legal,
and create new targets or add files and directories to the
clean list for the specified targets.
<P>
Multiple files or directories should be specified
either as separate arguments to the
<B>Clean</B>()

method, or as a list.
<B>Clean</B>()

will also accept the return value of any of the construction environment
Builder methods.
Examples:
<P>
The related
<B>NoClean</B>()

function overrides calling
<B>Clean</B>()

for the same target,
and any targets passed to both functions will
<I>not</I>

be removed by the
<B>-c</B>

option.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Clean('foo', ['bar', 'baz'])
Clean('dist', env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))
Clean(['foo', 'bar'], 'something_else_to_clean')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
In this example,
installing the project creates a subdirectory for the documentation.
This statement causes the subdirectory to be removed
if the project is deinstalled.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Clean(docdir, os.path.join(docdir, projectname))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.Clone([key=<I>val</I>, ...])

<DD>
Returns a separate copy of a construction environment.
If there are any keyword arguments specified,
they are added to the returned copy,
overwriting any existing values
for the keywords.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env2 = env.Clone()
env3 = env.Clone(CCFLAGS = '-g')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Additionally, a list of tools and a toolpath may be specified, as in
the Environment constructor:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def MyTool(env): env['FOO'] = 'bar'
env4 = env.Clone(tools = ['msvc', MyTool])

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The
<I>parse_flags</I>

keyword argument is also recognized:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# create an environment for compiling programs that use wxWidgets
wx_env = env.Clone(parse_flags = '!wx-config --cflags --cxxflags')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Command(<I>target</I>, <I>source</I>, <I>action</I>, [key=<I>val</I>, ...])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Command(<I>target</I>, <I>source</I>, <I>action</I>, [key=<I>val</I>, ...])

<DD>
Executes a specific action
(or list of actions)
to build a target file or files.
This is more convenient
than defining a separate Builder object
for a single special-case build.
<P>
As a special case, the
<I>source_scanner</I>

keyword argument can
be used to specify
a Scanner object
that will be used to scan the sources.
(The global
<B>DirScanner</B>

object can be used
if any of the sources will be directories
that must be scanned on-disk for
changes to files that aren't
already specified in other Builder of function calls.)
<P>
Any other keyword arguments specified override any
same-named existing construction variables.
<P>
An action can be an external command,
specified as a string,
or a callable Python object;
see &quot;Action Objects,&quot; below,
for more complete information.
Also note that a string specifying an external command
may be preceded by an
<B>@</B>

(at-sign)
to suppress printing the command in question,
or by a
<B>-</B>

(hyphen)
to ignore the exit status of the external command.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            &quot;$FOO_BUILD &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET&quot;)

env.Command('bar.out', 'bar.in',
            [&quot;rm -f $TARGET&quot;,
             &quot;$BAR_BUILD &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET&quot;],
            ENV = {'PATH' : '/usr/local/bin/'})

def rename(env, target, source):
    import os
    os.rename('.tmp', str(target[0]))

env.Command('baz.out', 'baz.in',
            [&quot;$BAZ_BUILD &lt; $SOURCES &gt; .tmp&quot;,
             rename ])

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Note that the
<B>Command</B>()

function will usually assume, by default,
that the specified targets and/or sources are Files,
if no other part of the configuration
identifies what type of entry it is.
If necessary, you can explicitly specify
that targets or source nodes should
be treated as directoriese
by using the

env.Command('ddd.list', Dir('ddd'), 'ls -l $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET')

env['DISTDIR'] = 'destination/directory'
env.Command(env.Dir('$DISTDIR')), None, make_distdir)

(Also note that SCons will usually
automatically create any directory necessary to hold a target file,
so you normally don't need to create directories by hand.)
<P>

<DT>Configure(<I>env</I>, [<I>custom_tests</I>, <I>conf_dir</I>, <I>log_file</I>, <I>config_h</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Configure([<I>custom_tests</I>, <I>conf_dir</I>, <I>log_file</I>, <I>config_h</I>])

<DD>
Creates a Configure object for integrated
functionality similar to GNU autoconf.
See the section &quot;Configure Contexts,&quot;
below, for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.
<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.Copy([key=<I>val</I>, ...])

<DD>
A now-deprecated synonym for
<B>env.Clone</B>().

<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.CVS(<I>repository</I>, <I>module</I>)

<DD>
A factory function that
returns a Builder object
to be used to fetch source files
from the specified
CVS
<I>repository</I>.

The returned Builder
is intended to be passed to the
<B>SourceCode</B>()

function.
<P>
This function is deprecated.  For details, see the entry for the
<B>SourceCode</B>()

function.
<P>
The optional specified
<I>module</I>

will be added to the beginning
of all repository path names;
this can be used, in essence,
to strip initial directory names
from the repository path names,
so that you only have to
replicate part of the repository
directory hierarchy in your
local build directory.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# Will fetch foo/bar/src.c
# from /usr/local/CVSROOT/foo/bar/src.c.
env.SourceCode('.', env.CVS('/usr/local/CVSROOT'))

# Will fetch bar/src.c
# from /usr/local/CVSROOT/foo/bar/src.c.
env.SourceCode('.', env.CVS('/usr/local/CVSROOT', 'foo'))

<P>

<DT>Decider(<I>function</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Decider(<I>function</I>)

<DD>
Specifies that all up-to-date decisions for
targets built through this construction environment
will be handled by the specified
<I>function</I>.

The
<I>function</I>

can be one of the following strings
that specify the type of decision function
to be performed:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>timestamp-newer</B>

<DD>
Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date and rebuilt
if the dependency's timestamp is newer than the target file's timestamp.
This is the behavior of the classic Make utility,
and
<B>make</B>

can be used a synonym for
<B>timestamp-newer</B>.

<DT><B>timestamp-match</B>

<DD>
Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date and rebuilt
if the dependency's timestamp is different than the
timestamp recorded the last time the target was built.
This provides behavior very similar to the classic Make utility
(in particular, files are not opened up so that their
contents can be checksummed)
except that the target will also be rebuilt if a
dependency file has been restored to a version with an
<I>earlier</I>

timestamp, such as can happen when restoring files from backup archives.
<DT><B>MD5</B>

<DD>
Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date and rebuilt
if the dependency's content has changed sine the last time
the target was built,
as determined be performing an MD5 checksum
on the dependency's contents
and comparing it to the checksum recorded the
last time the target was built.
<B>content</B>

can be used as a synonym for
<B>MD5</B>.

<DT><B>MD5-timestamp</B>

<DD>
Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date and rebuilt
if the dependency's content has changed sine the last time
the target was built,
except that dependencies with a timestamp that matches
the last time the target was rebuilt will be
assumed to be up-to-date and
<I>not</I>

rebuilt.
This provides behavior very similar
to the
<B>MD5</B>

behavior of always checksumming file contents,
with an optimization of not checking
the contents of files whose timestamps haven't changed.
The drawback is that SCons will
<I>not</I>

detect if a file's content has changed
but its timestamp is the same,
as might happen in an automated script
that runs a build,
updates a file,
and runs the build again,
all within a single second.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# Use exact timestamp matches by default.
Decider('timestamp-match')

# Use MD5 content signatures for any targets built
# with the attached construction environment.
env.Decider('content')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
In addition to the above already-available functions,
the
<I>function</I>

argument may be an actual Python function
that takes the following three arguments:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>dependency<DD>
The Node (file) which
should cause the
<I>target</I>

to be rebuilt
if it has &quot;changed&quot; since the last tme
<I>target</I>

was built.
<DT>target<DD>
The Node (file) being built.
In the normal case,
this is what should get rebuilt
if the
<I>dependency</I>

has &quot;changed.&quot;
<DT>prev_ni<DD>
Stored information about the state of the
<I>dependency</I>

the last time the
<I>target</I>

was built.
This can be consulted to match various
file characteristics
such as the timestamp,
size, or content signature.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
The
<I>function</I>

should return a
<B>True</B>

(non-zero)
value if the
<I>dependency</I>

has &quot;changed&quot; since the last time
the
<I>target</I>

was built
(indicating that the target
<I>should</I>

be rebuilt),
and
<B>False</B>

(zero)
otherwise
(indicating that the target should
<I>not</I>

be rebuilt).
Note that the decision can be made
using whatever criteria are appopriate.
Ignoring some or all of the function arguments
is perfectly normal.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def my_decider(dependency, target, prev_ni):
    return not os.path.exists(str(target))

env.Decider(my_decider)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Default(<I>targets</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Default(<I>targets</I>)

<DD>
This specifies a list of default targets,
which will be built by
<B>scons</B>

if no explicit targets are given on the command line.
Multiple calls to
<B>Default</B>()

are legal,
and add to the list of default targets.
<P>
Multiple targets should be specified as
separate arguments to the
<B>Default</B>()

method, or as a list.
<B>Default</B>()

will also accept the Node returned by any
of a construction environment's
builder methods.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Default('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
env.Default(['a', 'b', 'c'])
hello = env.Program('hello', 'hello.c')
env.Default(hello)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
An argument to
<B>Default</B>()

of
<B>None</B>

will clear all default targets.
Later calls to
<B>Default</B>()

will add to the (now empty) default-target list
like normal.
<P>
The current list of targets added using the
<B>Default</B>()

function or method is available in the
<B>DEFAULT_TARGETS</B>

list;
see below.
<P>

<DT>DefaultEnvironment([<I>args</I>])

<DD>
Creates and returns a default construction environment object.
This construction environment is used internally by SCons
in order to execute many of the global functions in this list,
and to fetch source files transparently
from source code management systems.
<P>

<DT>Depends(<I>target</I>, <I>dependency</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Depends(<I>target</I>, <I>dependency</I>)

<DD>
Specifies an explicit dependency;
the
<I>target</I>

will be rebuilt
whenever the
<I>dependency</I>

has changed.
Both the specified
<I>target</I>

and
<I>dependency</I>

can be a string
(usually the path name of a file or directory)
or Node objects,
or a list of strings or Node objects
(such as returned by a Builder call).
This should only be necessary
for cases where the dependency
is not caught by a Scanner
for the file.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Depends('foo', 'other-input-file-for-foo')

mylib = env.Library('mylib.c')
installed_lib = env.Install('lib', mylib)
bar = env.Program('bar.c')

# Arrange for the library to be copied into the installation
# directory before trying to build the &quot;bar&quot; program.
# (Note that this is for example only.  A &quot;real&quot; library
# dependency would normally be configured through the $LIBS
# and $LIBPATH variables, not using an env.Depends() call.)

env.Depends(bar, installed_lib)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.Dictionary([<I>vars</I>])

<DD>
Returns a dictionary object
containing copies of all of the
construction variables in the environment.
If there are any variable names specified,
only the specified construction
variables are returned in the dictionary.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
dict = env.Dictionary()
cc_dict = env.Dictionary('CC', 'CCFLAGS', 'CCCOM')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Dir(<I>name</I>, [<I>directory</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Dir(<I>name</I>, [<I>directory</I>])

<DD>
This returns a Directory Node,
an object that represents the specified directory
<I>name</I>.

<I>name</I>

can be a relative or absolute path.
<I>directory</I>

is an optional directory that will be used as the parent directory.
If no
<I>directory</I>

is specified, the current script's directory is used as the parent.
<P>
If
<I>name</I>

is a list, SCons returns a list of Dir nodes.
Construction variables are expanded in
<I>name</I>.

<P>
Directory Nodes can be used anywhere you
would supply a string as a directory name
to a Builder method or function.
Directory Nodes have attributes and methods
that are useful in many situations;
see &quot;File and Directory Nodes,&quot; below.
<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.Dump([<I>key</I>])

<DD>
Returns a pretty printable representation of the environment.
<I>key</I>,

if not
<B>None</B>,

should be a string containing the name of the variable of interest.
<P>
This SConstruct:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DT>EnsurePythonVersion(<I>major</I>, <I>minor</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.EnsurePythonVersion(<I>major</I>, <I>minor</I>)

<DD>
Ensure that the Python version is at least
<I>major</I>.<I>minor</I>.

This function will
print out an error message and exit SCons with a non-zero exit code if the
actual Python version is not late enough.
<P>
Example:

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.EnsureSConsVersion(<I>major</I>, <I>minor</I>, [<I>revision</I>])

<DD>
Ensure that the SCons version is at least
<I>major.minor</I>,

or
<I>major.minor.revision</I>.

if
<I>revision</I>

is specified.
This function will
print out an error message and exit SCons with a non-zero exit code if the
actual SCons version is not late enough.
<P>
Examples:

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Environment([key=<I>value</I>, ...])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Environment([key=<I>value</I>, ...])

<DD>
Return a new construction environment
initialized with the specified
<I>key</I>=<I>value</I>

pairs.
<P>

<DT>Execute(<I>action</I>, [<I>strfunction</I>, <I>varlist</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Execute(<I>action</I>, [<I>strfunction</I>, <I>varlist</I>])

<DD>
Executes an Action object.
The specified
<I>action</I>

may be an Action object
(see the section &quot;Action Objects,&quot;
below, for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior),
or it may be a command-line string,
list of commands,
or executable Python function,
each of which will be converted
into an Action object
and then executed.
The exit value of the command
or return value of the Python function
will be returned.
<P>
Note that
<B>scons</B>

will print an error message if the executed
<I>action</I>

fails--that is,
exits with or returns a non-zero value.
<B>scons</B>

will
<I>not</I>,

however,
automatically terminate the build
if the specified
<I>action</I>

fails.
If you want the build to stop in response to a failed
<B>Execute</B>()

call,
you must explicitly check for a non-zero return value:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Copy('file.out', 'file.in'))

if Execute(&quot;mkdir sub/dir/ectory&quot;):
    # The mkdir failed, don't try to build.
    <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+Exit">Exit</A>(1)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Exit([<I>value</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Exit([<I>value</I>])

<DD>
This tells
<B>scons</B>

to exit immediately
with the specified
<I>value</I>.

A default exit value of
<B>0</B>

(zero)
is used if no value is specified.
<P>

<DT>Export(<I>vars</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Export(<I>vars</I>)

<DD>
This tells
<B>scons</B>

to export a list of variables from the current
SConscript file to all other SConscript files.
The exported variables are kept in a global collection,
so subsequent calls to
<B>Export</B>()

will over-write previous exports that have the same name.
Multiple variable names can be passed to
<B>Export</B>()

as separate arguments or as a list.
Keyword arguments can be used to provide names and their values.
A dictionary can be used to map variables to a different name when exported.
Both local variables and global variables can be exported.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment()
# Make env available for all SConscript files to Import().
Export(&quot;env&quot;)

package = 'my_name'
# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:.
Export(&quot;env&quot;, &quot;package&quot;)

# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:
Export([&quot;env&quot;, &quot;package&quot;])

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export(debug = env)

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export({&quot;debug&quot;:env})

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Note that the
<B>SConscript</B>()

function supports an
<I>exports</I>

argument that makes it easier to to export a variable or
set of variables to a single SConscript file.
See the description of the
<B>SConscript</B>()

function, below.
<P>

<DT>File(<I>name</I>, [<I>directory</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.File(<I>name</I>, [<I>directory</I>])

<DD>
This returns a
File Node,
an object that represents the specified file
<I>name</I>.

<I>name</I>

can be a relative or absolute path.
<I>directory</I>

is an optional directory that will be used as the parent directory.
<P>
If
<I>name</I>

is a list, SCons returns a list of File nodes.
Construction variables are expanded in
<I>name</I>.

<P>
File Nodes can be used anywhere you
would supply a string as a file name
to a Builder method or function.
File Nodes have attributes and methods
that are useful in many situations;
see &quot;File and Directory Nodes,&quot; below.
<P>

<DT>FindFile(<I>file</I>, <I>dirs</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.FindFile(<I>file</I>, <I>dirs</I>)

<DD>
Search for
<I>file</I>

in the path specified by
<I>dirs</I>.

<I>dirs</I>

may be a list of directory names or a single directory name.
In addition to searching for files that exist in the filesystem,
this function also searches for derived files
that have not yet been built.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
foo = env.FindFile('foo', ['dir1', 'dir2'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>FindInstalledFiles()

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.FindInstalledFiles()

<DD>
Returns the list of targets set up by the
<B>Install</B>()

or
<B>InstallAs</B>()

builders.
<P>
This function serves as a convenient method to select the contents of
a binary package.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Install( '/bin', [ 'executable_a', 'executable_b' ] )

# will return the file node list
# [ '/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b' ]
FindInstalledFiles()

Install( '/lib', [ 'some_library' ] )

# will return the file node list
# [ '/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b', '/lib/some_library' ]
FindInstalledFiles()

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>FindPathDirs(<I>variable</I>)

<DD>
Returns a function
(actually a callable Python object)
intended to be used as the
<I>path_function</I>

of a Scanner object.
The returned object will look up the specified
<I>variable</I>

in a construction environment
and treat the construction variable's value as a list of
directory paths that should be searched
(like
<B>$CPPPATH</B>,

<B>$LIBPATH</B>,

etc.).
<P>
Note that use of
<B>FindPathDirs</B>()

is generally preferable to
writing your own
<I>path_function</I>

for the following reasons:
1) The returned list will contain all appropriate directories
found in source trees
(when
<B>VariantDir</B>()

is used)
or in code repositories
(when
<B>Repository</B>()

or the
<B>-Y</B>

option are used).
2) scons will identify expansions of
<I>variable</I>

that evaluate to the same list of directories as,
in fact, the same list,
and avoid re-scanning the directories for files,
when possible.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    # Code to scan file contents goes here...
    return include_files

scanner = Scanner(name = 'myscanner',
                  function = my_scan,
                  path_function = FindPathDirs('MYPATH'))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>FindSourceFiles(node=<I>'.')</I>

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.FindSourceFiles(node=<I>'.')</I>

<DD>
Returns the list of nodes which serve as the source of the built files.
It does so by inspecting the dependency tree starting at the optional
argument
<I>node</I>

which defaults to the '&quot;.&quot;'-node. It will then return all leaves of
<I>node</I>.

These are all children which have no further children.
<P>
This function is a convenient method to select the contents of a Source
Package.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Program( 'src/main_a.c' )
Program( 'src/main_b.c' )
Program( 'main_c.c' )

# returns ['main_c.c', 'src/main_a.c', 'SConstruct', 'src/main_b.c']
FindSourceFiles()

# returns ['src/main_b.c', 'src/main_a.c' ]
FindSourceFiles( 'src' )

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
As you can see build support files (SConstruct in the above example)
will also be returned by this function.
<P>

<DT>Flatten(<I>sequence</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Flatten(<I>sequence</I>)

<DD>
Takes a sequence (that is, a Python list or tuple)
that may contain nested sequences
and returns a flattened list containing
all of the individual elements in any sequence.
This can be helpful for collecting
the lists returned by calls to Builders;
other Builders will automatically
flatten lists specified as input,
but direct Python manipulation of
these lists does not.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')

# Because `foo' and `bar' are lists returned by the Object() Builder,
# `objects' will be a list containing nested lists:
objects = ['f1.o', foo, 'f2.o', bar, 'f3.o']

# Passing such a list to another Builder is all right because
# the Builder will flatten the list automatically:
Program(source = objects)

# If you need to manipulate the list directly using Python, you need to
# call Flatten() yourself, or otherwise handle nested lists:
for object in Flatten(objects):
    print str(object)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>GetBuildFailures()

<DD>
Returns a list of exceptions for the
actions that failed while
attempting to build targets.
Each element in the returned list is a
<I>BuildError</I>

object
with the following attributes
that record various aspects
of the build failure:
<P>
<B>.node</B>

The node that was being built
when the build failure occurred.
<P>
<B>.status</B>

The numeric exit status
returned by the command or Python function
that failed when trying to build the
specified Node.
<P>
<B>.errstr</B>

The SCons error string
describing the build failure.
(This is often a generic
message like &quot;Error 2&quot;
to indicate that an executed
command exited with a status of 2.)
<P>
<B>.filename</B>

The name of the file or
directory that actually caused the failure.
This may be different from the
<B>.node</B>

attribute.
For example,
if an attempt to build a target named
<B>sub/dir/target</B>

fails because the
<B>sub/dir</B>

directory could not be created,
then the
<B>.node</B>

attribute will be
<B>sub/dir/target</B>

but the
<B>.filename</B>

attribute will be
<B>sub/dir</B>.

<P>
<B>.executor</B>

The SCons Executor object
for the target Node
being built.
This can be used to retrieve
the construction environment used
for the failed action.
<P>
<B>.action</B>

The actual SCons Action object that failed.
This will be one specific action
out of the possible list of
actions that would have been
executed to build the target.
<P>
<B>.command</B>

The actual expanded command that was executed and failed,
after expansion of
<B>$TARGET</B>,

<B>$SOURCE</B>,

and other construction variables.
<P>
Note that the
<B>GetBuildFailures</B>()

function
will always return an empty list
until any build failure has occurred,
which means that
<B>GetBuildFailures</B>()

will always return an empty list
while the
<B>SConscript</B>

files are being read.
Its primary intended use is
for functions that will be
executed before SCons exits
by passing them to the
standard Python
<B>atexit.register</B>()

function.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
import atexit

def print_build_failures():
    from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
    for bf in GetBuildFailures():
        print &quot;%s failed: %s&quot; % (bf.node, bf.errstr)

atexit.register(print_build_failures)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>GetBuildPath(<I>file</I>, [...])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.GetBuildPath(<I>file</I>, [...])

<DD>
Returns the
<B>scons</B>

path name (or names) for the specified
<I>file</I>

(or files).
The specified

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Glob(<I>pattern</I>, [<I>ondisk</I>, <I>source</I>, <I>strings</I>])

<DD>
Returns Nodes (or strings) that match the specified
<I>pattern</I>,

relative to the directory of the current
<B>SConscript</B>

file.
The
<B>env.Glob</B>()

form performs string substition on
<I>pattern</I>

and returns whatever matches
the resulting expanded pattern.
<P>
The specified
<I>pattern</I>

uses Unix shell style metacharacters for matching:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
  *       matches everything
  ?       matches any single character
  [seq]   matches any character in seq
  [!seq]  matches any char not in seq

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
If the first character of a filename is a dot,
it must be matched explicitly.
Character matches do
<I>not</I>

span directory separators.
<P>
The
<B>Glob</B>()

knows about
repositories
(see the
<B>Repository</B>()

function)
and source directories
(see the
<B>VariantDir</B>()

function)
and
returns a Node (or string, if so configured)
in the local (SConscript) directory
if matching Node is found
anywhere in a corresponding
repository or source directory.
<P>
The
<I>ondisk</I>

argument may be set to
<B>False</B>

(or any other non-true value)
to disable the search for matches on disk,
thereby only returning matches among
already-configured File or Dir Nodes.
The default behavior is to
return corresponding Nodes
for any on-disk matches found.
<P>
The
<I>source</I>

argument may be set to
<B>True</B>

(or any equivalent value)
to specify that,
when the local directory is a
<B>VariantDir</B>(),

the returned Nodes should be from the
corresponding source directory,
not the local directory.
<P>
The
<I>strings</I>

argument may be set to
<B>True</B>

(or any equivalent value)
to have the
<B>Glob</B>()

function return strings, not Nodes,
that represent the matched files or directories.
The returned strings will be relative to
the local (SConscript) directory.
(Note that This may make it easier to perform
arbitrary manipulation of file names,
but if the returned strings are
passed to a different
<B>SConscript</B>

file,
any Node translation will be relative
to the other
<B>SConscript</B>

directory,
not the original
<B>SConscript</B>

directory.)

<DT>Help(<I>text</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Help(<I>text</I>)

<DD>
This specifies help text to be printed if the

If
<B>Help</B>()

is called multiple times, the text is appended together in the order
that

<DT>Ignore(<I>target</I>, <I>dependency</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Ignore(<I>target</I>, <I>dependency</I>)

<DD>
The specified dependency file(s)
will be ignored when deciding if
the target file(s) need to be rebuilt.
<P>
You can also use
<B>Ignore</B>()

to remove a target from the default build.
In order to do this you must specify the directory the target will
be built in as the target, and the file you want to skip building
as the dependency.
<P>
Note that this will only remove the dependencies listed from 
the files built by default.  It will still be built if that 
dependency is needed by another object being built. 
See the third and forth examples below.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Ignore('foo', 'foo.c')

<DT>Import(<I>vars</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Import(<I>vars</I>)

<DD>
This tells
<B>scons</B>

to import a list of variables into the current SConscript file. This
will import variables that were exported with
<B>Export</B>()

or in the
<I>exports</I>

argument to
<B>SConscript</B>().

Variables exported by
<B>SConscript</B>()

have precedence.
Multiple variable names can be passed to
<B>Import</B>()

as separate arguments or as a list. The variable &quot;*&quot; can be used
to import all variables.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Import(&quot;env&quot;)
Import(&quot;env&quot;, &quot;variable&quot;)
Import([&quot;env&quot;, &quot;variable&quot;])

<P>

<DT>Literal(<I>string</I>)

<P>

<DT>Local(<I>targets</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Local(<I>targets</I>)

<DD>
The specified
<I>targets</I>

will have copies made in the local tree,
even if an already up-to-date copy
exists in a repository.
Returns a list of the target Node or Nodes.
<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.MergeFlags(<I>arg</I>, [<I>unique</I>])

<DD>
Merges the specified
<I>arg</I>

values to the construction environment's construction variables.
If the
<I>arg</I>

argument is not a dictionary,
it is converted to one by calling
<B>env.ParseFlags</B>()

on the argument
before the values are merged.
Note that
<I>arg</I>

must be a single value,
so multiple strings must
be passed in as a list,
not as separate arguments to
<B>env.MergeFlags</B>().

<P>
By default,
duplicate values are eliminated;
you can, however, specify
<B>unique=0</B>

to allow duplicate
values to be added.
When eliminating duplicate values,
any construction variables that end with
the string
<B>PATH</B>

keep the left-most unique value.
All other construction variables keep
the right-most unique value.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# Add an optimization flag to $CCFLAGS.
env.MergeFlags('-O3')

# Combine the flags returned from running pkg-config with an optimization
# flag and merge the result into the construction variables.
env.MergeFlags(['!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags', '-O3'])

# Combine an optimization flag with the flags returned from running pkg-config
# twice and merge the result into the construction variables.
env.MergeFlags(['-O3',

<DT>NoCache(<I>target</I>, ...)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.NoCache(<I>target</I>, ...)

<DD>
Specifies a list of files which should
<I>not</I>

be cached whenever the
<B>CacheDir</B>()

method has been activated.
The specified targets may be a list
or an individual target.
<P>
Multiple files should be specified
either as separate arguments to the
<B>NoCache</B>()

method, or as a list.
<B>NoCache</B>()

will also accept the return value of any of the construction environment
Builder methods.
<P>
Calling
<B>NoCache</B>()

on directories and other non-File Node types has no effect because
only File Nodes are cached.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
NoCache('foo.elf')
NoCache(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

</PRE>

<P>

<DT>NoClean(<I>target</I>, ...)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.NoClean(<I>target</I>, ...)

<DD>
Specifies a list of files or directories which should
<I>not</I>

be removed whenever the targets (or their dependencies)
are specified with the
<B>-c</B>

command line option.
The specified targets may be a list
or an individual target.
Multiple calls to
<B>NoClean</B>()

are legal,
and prevent each specified target
from being removed by calls to the
<B>-c</B>

option.
<P>
Multiple files or directories should be specified
either as separate arguments to the
<B>NoClean</B>()

method, or as a list.
<B>NoClean</B>()

will also accept the return value of any of the construction environment
Builder methods.
<P>
Calling
<B>NoClean</B>()

for a target overrides calling
<B>Clean</B>()

for the same target,
and any targets passed to both functions will
<I>not</I>

be removed by the
<B>-c</B>

option.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
NoClean('foo.elf')
NoClean(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.ParseConfig(<I>command</I>, [<I>function</I>, <I>unique</I>])

<DD>
Calls the specified
<I>function</I>

to modify the environment as specified by the output of
<I>command</I>.

The default
<I>function</I>

is
<B>env.MergeFlags</B>(),

which expects the output of a typical
<B>*-config</B>

command
(for example,
<B>gtk-config</B>)

and adds the options
to the appropriate construction variables.
By default,
duplicate values are not
added to any construction variables;
you can specify
<B>unique=0</B>

to allow duplicate
values to be added.
<P>
Interpreted options
and the construction variables they affect
are as specified for the
<B>env.ParseFlags</B>()

method (which this method calls).
See that method's description, below,
for a table of options and construction variables.
<P>

<DT>ParseDepends(<I>filename</I>, [<I>must_exist</I>, <I>only_one</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.ParseDepends(<I>filename</I>, [<I>must_exist</I>, <I>only_one</I>])

<DD>
Parses the contents of the specified
<I>filename</I>

as a list of dependencies in the style of
<B>Make</B>

or
<B>mkdep</B>,

and explicitly establishes all of the listed dependencies.
<P>
By default,
it is not an error
if the specified
<I>filename</I>

does not exist.
The optional
<I>must_exist</I>

argument may be set to a non-zero
value to have
scons
throw an exception and
generate an error if the file does not exist,
or is otherwise inaccessible.
<P>
The optional
<I>only_one</I>

argument may be set to a non-zero
value to have
scons
thrown an exception and
generate an error
if the file contains dependency
information for more than one target.
This can provide a small sanity check
for files intended to be generated
by, for example, the
<B>gcc -M</B>

flag,
which should typically only
write dependency information for
one output file into a corresponding
<B>.d</B>

file.
<P>
The
<I>filename</I>

and all of the files listed therein
will be interpreted relative to
the directory of the
<B>SConscript</B>

file which calls the
<B>ParseDepends</B>()

function.
<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.ParseFlags(<I>flags</I>, ...)

<DD>
Parses one or more strings containing
typical command-line flags for GCC tool chains
and returns a dictionary with the flag values
separated into the appropriate SCons construction variables.
This is intended as a companion to the
<B>env.MergeFlags</B>()

method, but allows for the values in the returned dictionary
to be modified, if necessary,
before merging them into the construction environment.
(Note that
<B>env.MergeFlags</B>()

will call this method if its argument is not a dictionary,
so it is usually not necessary to call
<B>env.ParseFlags</B>()

directly unless you want to manipulate the values.)
<P>
If the first character in any string is
an exclamation mark (!),
the rest of the string is executed as a command,
and the output from the command is
parsed as GCC tool chain command-line flags
and added to the resulting dictionary.
<P>
Flag values are translated accordig to the prefix found,
and added to the following construction variables:

<DT><I>env</I>.Perforce()

<DD>
A factory function that
returns a Builder object
to be used to fetch source files
from the Perforce source code management system.
The returned Builder
is intended to be passed to the
<B>SourceCode</B>()

function.
<P>
This function is deprecated.  For details, see the entry for the
<B>SourceCode</B>()

function.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SourceCode('.', env.Perforce())

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Perforce uses a number of external
environment variables for its operation.
Consequently, this function adds the
following variables from the user's external environment
to the construction environment's
ENV dictionary:
P4CHARSET,
P4CLIENT,
P4LANGUAGE,
P4PASSWD,
P4PORT,
P4USER,
SystemRoot,
USER,
and
USERNAME.
<P>

<DT>Platform(<I>string</I>)

<DD>
The
<B>Platform</B>()

form returns a callable object
that can be used to initialize
a construction environment using the
platform keyword of the
<B>Environment</B>()

function.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(platform = Platform('win32'))

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The
<B>env.Platform</B>()

form applies the callable object for the specified platform
<I>string</I>

to the environment through which the method was called.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Platform('posix')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Note that the
<B>win32</B>

platform adds the
<B>SystemDrive</B>

and
<B>SystemRoot</B>

variables from the user's external environment
to the construction environment's
<B>$ENV</B>

dictionary.
This is so that any executed commands
that use sockets to connect with other systems
(such as fetching source files from
external CVS repository specifications like
<B>:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net">anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net</A>:/cvsroot/scons</B>)

will work on Windows systems.

<DT>Precious(<I>target</I>, ...)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Precious(<I>target</I>, ...)

<DD>
Marks each given

<B>scons</B>

deletes a target before building it.
Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call to
<B>Precious</B>().

<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.Prepend(key=<I>val</I>, [...])

<DD>
Appends the specified keyword arguments
to the beginning of construction variables in the environment.
If the Environment does not have
the specified construction variable,
it is simply added to the environment.
If the values of the construction variable
and the keyword argument are the same type,
then the two values will be simply added together.
Otherwise, the construction variable
and the value of the keyword argument
are both coerced to lists,
and the lists are added together.
(See also the Append method, above.)
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Prepend(CCFLAGS = '-g ', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.PrependENVPath(<I>name</I>, <I>newpath</I>, [<I>envname</I>, <I>sep</I>, <I>delete_existing</I>])

<DD>
This appends new path elements to the given path in the
specified external environment
(<B>$ENV</B>

by default).
This will only add
any particular path once (leaving the first one it encounters and
ignoring the rest, to preserve path order),
and to help assure this,
will normalize all paths (using
<B>os.path.normpath</B>

and
<B>os.path.normcase</B>).

This can also handle the
case where the given old path variable is a list instead of a
string, in which case a list will be returned instead of a string.
<P>
If
<I>delete_existing</I>

is 0, then adding a path that already exists
will not move it to the beginning;
it will stay where it is in the list.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
print 'before:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.PrependENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print 'after:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The above example will print:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
before: /biz:/foo
after: /foo/bar:/foo:/biz

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.PrependUnique(key=<I>val</I>, delete_existing=<I>0, [...])</I>

<DD>
Appends the specified keyword arguments
to the beginning of construction variables in the environment.
If the Environment does not have
the specified construction variable,
it is simply added to the environment.
If the construction variable being appended to is a list,
then any value(s) that already exist in the
construction variable will
<I>not</I>

be added again to the list.
However, if delete_existing is 1, 
existing matching values are removed first, so
existing values in the arg list move to the front of the list.

env.PrependUnique(CCFLAGS = '-g', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

<DD>
<DT>Progress(<I>list_of_strings</I>, [<I>interval</I>, <I>file</I>, <I>overwrite</I>])

<DD>
Allows SCons to show progress made during the build
by displaying a string or calling a function while
evaluating Nodes (e.g. files).
<P>
If the first specified argument is a Python callable
(a function or an object that has a
<B>__call__</B>()

method),
the function will be called
once every
<I>interval</I>

times a Node is evaluated.
The callable will be passed the evaluated Node
as its only argument.
(For future compatibility,
it's a good idea to also add
<B>*args</B>

and
<B>**kw</B>

as arguments to your function or method.
This will prevent the code from breaking
if SCons ever changes the interface
to call the function with additional arguments in the future.)
<P>
An example of a simple custom progress function
that prints a string containing the Node name
every 10 Nodes:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kw):
    print 'Evaluating node %s!' % node
Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
A more complicated example of a custom progress display object
that prints a string containing a count
every 100 evaluated Nodes.
Note the use of
<B>\r</B>

(a carriage return)
at the end so that the string
will overwrite itself on a display:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
import sys
class ProgressCounter(object):
    count = 0
    def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
        self.count += 100
        sys.stderr.write('Evaluated %s nodes\r' % self.count)
Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
If the first argument
<B>Progress</B>()

is a string,
the string will be displayed
every
<I>interval</I>

evaluated Nodes.
The default is to print the string on standard output;
an alternate output stream
may be specified with the
<B>file=</B>

argument.
The following will print a series of dots
on the error output,
one dot for every 100 evaluated Nodes:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
import sys
Progress('.', interval=100, file=sys.stderr)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
If the string contains the verbatim substring
<B>$TARGET</B>,

it will be replaced with the Node.
Note that, for performance reasons, this is
<I>not</I>

a regular SCons variable substition,
so you can not use other variables
or use curly braces.
The following example will print the name of
every evaluated Node,
using a
<B>\r</B>

(carriage return) to cause each line to overwritten by the next line,
and the
<B>overwrite=</B>

keyword argument to make sure the previously-printed
file name is overwritten with blank spaces:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
import sys
Progress('$TARGET\r', overwrite=True)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
If the first argument to
<B>Progress</B>()

is a list of strings,
then each string in the list will be displayed
in rotating fashion every
<I>interval</I>

evaluated Nodes.
This can be used to implement a &quot;spinner&quot;
on the user's screen as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Progress(['-\r', '\\\r', '|\r', '/\r'], interval=5)

<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.RCS()

<DD>
A factory function that
returns a Builder object
to be used to fetch source files
from RCS.
The returned Builder
is intended to be passed to the
<B>SourceCode</B>()

function:
<P>
This function is deprecated.  For details, see the entry for the
<B>SourceCode</B>()

function.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SourceCode('.', env.RCS())

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Note that
<B>scons</B>

will fetch source files
from RCS subdirectories automatically,
so configuring RCS
as demonstrated in the above example
should only be necessary if
you are fetching from
RCS,v
files in the same
directory as the source files,
or if you need to explicitly specify RCS
for a specific subdirectory.
<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.Replace(key=<I>val</I>, [...])

<DD>
Replaces construction variables in the Environment

<P>

<DT>Repository(<I>directory</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Repository(<I>directory</I>)

<DD>
Specifies that
<I>directory</I>

is a repository to be searched for files.
Multiple calls to
<B>Repository</B>()

are legal,
and each one adds to the list of
repositories that will be searched.
<P>
To
<B>scons</B>,

a repository is a copy of the source tree,
from the top-level directory on down,
which may contain
both source files and derived files
that can be used to build targets in
the local source tree.
The canonical example would be an
official source tree maintained by an integrator.
If the repository contains derived files,
then the derived files should have been built using
<B>scons</B>,

so that the repository contains the necessary
signature information to allow
<B>scons</B>

to figure out when it is appropriate to
use the repository copy of a derived file,
instead of building one locally.
<P>
Note that if an up-to-date derived file
already exists in a repository,
<B>scons</B>

will
<I>not</I>

make a copy in the local directory tree.
In order to guarantee that a local copy
will be made,
use the
<B>Local</B>()

method.
<P>

<DT>Requires(<I>target</I>, <I>prerequisite</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Requires(<I>target</I>, <I>prerequisite</I>)

<DD>
Specifies an order-only relationship
between the specified target file(s)
and the specified prerequisite file(s).
The prerequisite file(s)
will be (re)built, if necessary,
<I>before</I>

the target file(s),
but the target file(s) do not actually
depend on the prerequisites
and will not be rebuilt simply because
the prerequisite file(s) change.
<P>
Example:

env.Requires('foo', 'file-that-must-be-built-before-foo')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Return([<I>vars</I>..., stop=<I>])</I>

<DD>
By default,
this stops processing the current SConscript
file and returns to the calling SConscript file
the values of the variables named in the
<I>vars</I>

string arguments.
Multiple strings contaning variable names may be passed to
<B>Return</B>().

Any strings that contain white space
<P>
The optional
<B>stop=</B>

keyword argument may be set to a false value
to continue processing the rest of the SConscript
file after the
<B>Return</B>()

call.
This was the default behavior prior to SCons 0.98.
However, the values returned
are still the values of the variables in the named
<I>vars</I>

at the point
<B>Return</B>()

is called.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# Returns without returning a value.
Return()

# Returns the value of the 'foo' Python variable.
Return(&quot;foo&quot;)

# Returns the values of the Python variables 'foo' and 'bar'.

<P>

<DT><I>env</I>.SCCS()

<DD>
A factory function that
returns a Builder object
to be used to fetch source files
from SCCS.
The returned Builder
is intended to be passed to the
<B>SourceCode</B>()

function.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SourceCode('.', env.SCCS())

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Note that
<B>scons</B>

will fetch source files
from SCCS subdirectories automatically,
so configuring SCCS
as demonstrated in the above example
should only be necessary if
you are fetching from
<B>s.SCCS</B>

files in the same
directory as the source files,
or if you need to explicitly specify SCCS
for a specific subdirectory.

<DT><I>env</I>.SConscript(dirs=<I>subdirs</I>, [name=<I>script</I>, <I>exports</I>, <I>variant_dir</I>, <I>duplicate</I>])

<DD>
This tells
<B>scons</B>

to execute
one or more subsidiary SConscript (configuration) files.
Any variables returned by a called script using
<B>Return</B>()

will be returned by the call to
<B>SConscript</B>().

There are two ways to call the
<B>SConscript</B>()

function.
<P>
The first way you can call
<B>SConscript</B>()

is to explicitly specify one or more
<I>scripts</I>

as the first argument.
A single script may be specified as a string;
multiple scripts must be specified as a list
(either explicitly or as created by
a function like
<B>Split</B>()).

Examples:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
SConscript('SConscript')      # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript('src/SConscript')  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(['src/SConscript', 'doc/SConscript'])
config = SConscript('MyConfig.py')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The second way you can call
<B>SConscript</B>()

is to specify a list of (sub)directory names
as a
<B>dirs=</B><I>subdirs</I>

keyword argument.
In this case,
<B>scons</B>

will, by default,
execute a subsidiary configuration file named
<B>SConscript</B>

in each of the specified directories.
You may specify a name other than
<B>SConscript</B>

by supplying an optional
<B>name=</B><I>script</I>

keyword argument.
The first three examples below have the same effect
as the first three examples above:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
SConscript(dirs='.')      # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(dirs='src')    # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(dirs=['src', 'doc'])
SConscript(dirs=['sub1', 'sub2'], name='MySConscript')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The optional
<I>exports</I>

argument provides a list of variable names or a dictionary of
named values to export to the
<I>script(s)</I>.

These variables are locally exported only to the specified
<I>script(s)</I>,

and do not affect the global pool of variables used by the
<B>Export</B>()

function.
The subsidiary
<I>script(s)</I>

must use the
<B>Import</B>()

function to import the variables.
Examples:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
foo = SConscript('sub/SConscript', exports='env')
SConscript('dir/SConscript', exports=['env', 'variable'])
SConscript(dirs='subdir', exports='env variable')
SConscript(dirs=['one', 'two', 'three'], exports='shared_info')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
If the optional
<I>variant_dir</I>

argument is present, it causes an effect equivalent to the
<B>VariantDir</B>()

method described below.
(If
<I>variant_dir</I>

is not present, the
<I>duplicate</I>

argument is ignored.)
The
<I>variant_dir</I>

argument is interpreted relative to the directory of the calling
<B>SConscript</B>

file.
See the description of the
<B>VariantDir</B>()

function below for additional details and restrictions.
<P>
If
<I>variant_dir</I>

is present,
the source directory is the directory in which the
<B>SConscript</B>

file resides and the
<B>SConscript</B>

file is evaluated as if it were in the
<I>variant_dir</I>

directory:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir = 'build')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
is equivalent to
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
VariantDir('build', 'src')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
This later paradigm is often used when the sources are
in the same directory as the
<B>SConstruct</B>:

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir = 'build')

<DT>SConscriptChdir(<I>value</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.SConscriptChdir(<I>value</I>)

<DD>
By default,
<B>scons</B>

changes its working directory
to the directory in which each
subsidiary SConscript file lives.
This behavior may be disabled
by specifying either:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
SConscriptChdir(0)
env.SConscriptChdir(0)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
in which case

will stay in the top-level directory
while reading all SConscript files.

when all the directories in which SConscript files may be found
don't necessarily exist locally.)
You may enable and disable
this ability by calling
SConscriptChdir()
multiple times.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

SConscriptChdir(0)
SConscript('foo/SConscript')    # will not chdir to foo

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.SConsignFile([<I>file</I>, <I>dbm_module</I>])

<DD>
This tells
<B>scons</B>

to store all file signatures
in the specified database
<I>file</I>.

If the
<I>file</I>

name is omitted,
<B>.sconsign</B>

is used by default.
(The actual file name(s) stored on disk
may have an appropriated suffix appended
by the
<I>dbm_module</I>.)

If
<I>file</I>

is not an absolute path name,
the file is placed in the same directory as the top-level
<B>SConstruct</B>

file.
<P>
If

is
<B>None</B>,

then
<B>scons</B>

will store file signatures
in a separate
<B>.sconsign</B>

file in each directory,
not in one global database file.
(This was the default behavior
prior to SCons 0.96.91 and 0.97.)
<P>
The optional
<I>dbm_module</I>

argument can be used to specify
which Python database module
The default is to use a custom
<B>SCons.dblite</B>

module that uses pickled
Python data structures,
and which works on all Python versions.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DT>SideEffect(<I>side_effect</I>, <I>target</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.SideEffect(<I>side_effect</I>, <I>target</I>)

<DD>
Declares
<I>side_effect</I>

as a side effect of building
<I>target</I>.

Both
<I>side_effect</I>

and
<I>target</I>

can be a list, a file name, or a node.
A side effect is a target file that is created or updated
as a side effect of building other targets.
For example, a Windows PDB
file is created as a side effect of building the .obj
files for a static library,
and various log files are created updated
as side effects of various TeX commands.
If a target is a side effect of multiple build commands,
<B>scons</B>

will ensure that only one set of commands
is executed at a time.
Consequently, you only need to use this method
for side-effect targets that are built as a result of
multiple build commands.
<P>
Because multiple build commands may update
the same side effect file,
by default the
<I>side_effect</I>

target is
<I>not</I>

automatically removed
when the
<I>target</I>

is removed by the
<B>-c</B>

option.
(Note, however, that the
<I>side_effect</I>

might be removed as part of
cleaning the directory in which it lives.)
If you want to make sure the
<I>side_effect</I>

is cleaned whenever a specific
<I>target</I>

is cleaned,
you must specify this explicitly
with the
<B>Clean</B>()

or
<B>env.Clean</B>()

function.
<P>

<DT>SourceCode(<I>entries</I>, <I>builder</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.SourceCode(<I>entries</I>, <I>builder</I>)

<DD>
This function and its associate factory functions are deprecated.
There is no replacement.
The intended use was to keep a local tree in sync with an archive,
but in actuality the function only causes the archive
to be fetched on the first run.
Synchronizing with the archive is best done external to &amp;SCons;.
<P>
Arrange for non-existent source files to
be fetched from a source code management system
using the specified
<I>builder</I>.

The specified
<I>entries</I>

may be a Node, string or list of both,
and may represent either individual
source files or directories in which
source files can be found.
<P>
For any non-existent source files,
<B>scons</B>

will search up the directory tree
and use the first
<B>SourceCode</B>()

builder it finds.
The specified
<I>builder</I>

may be
<B>None</B>,

in which case
<B>scons</B>

will not use a builder to fetch
source files for the specified
<I>entries</I>,

even if a
<B>SourceCode</B>()

builder has been specified
for a directory higher up the tree.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

will, by default,
fetch files from SCCS or RCS subdirectories
without explicit configuration.
This takes some extra processing time
to search for the necessary
source code management files on disk.
You can avoid these extra searches
and speed up your build a little
by disabling these searches as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SourceCode('.', None)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Note that if the specified
<I>builder</I>

is one you create by hand,
it must have an associated
construction environment to use
when fetching a source file.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

provides a set of canned factory
functions that return appropriate
Builders for various popular
source code management systems.
Canonical examples of invocation include:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

env.SourceCode('.', env.BitKeeper('/usr/local/BKsources'))
env.SourceCode('src', env.CVS('/usr/local/CVSROOT'))

<DT>SourceSignatures(<I>type</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.SourceSignatures(<I>type</I>)

<DD>
Note:  Although it is not yet officially deprecated,
use of this function is discouraged.
See the
<B>Decider</B>()

function for a more flexible and straightforward way
to configure SCons' decision-making.
<P>
The
<B>SourceSignatures</B>()

function tells
<B>scons</B>

how to decide if a source file
(a file that is not built from any other files)
has changed since the last time it
was used to build a particular target file.
Legal values are
<B>MD5</B>

or
<B>timestamp</B>.

<P>
If the environment method is used,
the specified type of source signature
is only used when deciding whether targets
built with that environment are up-to-date or must be rebuilt.
If the global function is used,
the specified type of source signature becomes the default
used for all decisions
about whether targets are up-to-date.
<P>
<B>MD5</B>

means
<B>scons</B>

decides that a source file has changed
if the MD5 checksum of its contents has changed since
the last time it was used to rebuild a particular target file.
<P>
<B>timestamp</B>

means
<B>scons</B>

decides that a source file has changed
if its timestamp (modification time) has changed since
the last time it was used to rebuild a particular target file.
(Note that although this is similar to the behavior of Make,
by default it will also rebuild if the dependency is
<I>older</I>

than the last time it was used to rebuild the target file.)
<P>
There is no different between the two behaviors
for Python
<B>Value</B>()

node objects.
<P>
<B>MD5</B>

signatures take longer to compute,
but are more accurate than
<B>timestamp</B>

signatures.
The default value is
<B>MD5</B>.

<P>
Note that the default
<B>TargetSignatures</B>()

setting (see below)
is to use this
<B>SourceSignatures</B>()

setting for any target files that are used
to build other target files.
Consequently, changing the value of
<B>SourceSignatures</B>()

will, by default,
affect the up-to-date decision for all files in the build
(or all files built with a specific construction environment
when
<B>env.SourceSignatures</B>()

is used).
<P>

<DT>Split(<I>arg</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Split(<I>arg</I>)

<DD>
Returns a list of file names or other objects.
If arg is a string,
it will be split on strings of white-space characters
within the string,
making it easier to write long lists of file names.
If arg is already a list,
the list will be returned untouched.
If arg is any other type of object,
it will be returned as a list
containing just the object.

<DT><I>env</I>.subst(<I>input</I>, [<I>raw</I>, <I>target</I>, <I>source</I>, <I>conv</I>])

<DD>
Performs construction variable interpolation
on the specified string or sequence argument
<I>input</I>.

<P>
By default,
leading or trailing white space will
be removed from the result.
and all sequences of white space
will be compressed to a single space character.
Additionally, any
<B>$(</B>

and
<B>$)</B>

character sequences will be stripped from the returned string,
The optional
<I>raw</I>

argument may be set to
<B>1</B>

if you want to preserve white space and
<B>$(</B>-<B>$)</B>

sequences.
The
<I>raw</I>

argument may be set to
<B>2</B>

if you want to strip
all characters between
any
<B>$(</B>

and
<B>$)</B>

pairs
(as is done for signature calculation).
<P>
If the input is a sequence
(list or tuple),
the individual elements of
the sequence will be expanded,
and the results will be returned as a list.
<P>
The optional
<I>target</I>

and
<I>source</I>

keyword arguments
must be set to lists of
target and source nodes, respectively,
if you want the
<B>$TARGET</B>,

<B>$TARGETS</B>,

<B>$SOURCE</B>

and
<B>$SOURCES</B>

to be available for expansion.
This is usually necessary if you are
calling
<B>env.subst</B>()

from within a Python function used
as an SCons action.
<P>
Returned string values or sequence elements
are converted to their string representation by default.
The optional
<I>conv</I>

argument
may specify a conversion function
that will be used in place of
the default.
For example, if you want Python objects
(including SCons Nodes)
to be returned as Python objects,
you can use the Python
<B>lambda</B>

idiom to pass in an unnamed function
that simply returns its unconverted argument.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
print env.subst(&quot;The C compiler is: $CC&quot;)

def compile(target, source, env):
    sourceDir = env.subst(&quot;${SOURCE.srcdir}&quot;,
                          target=target,
                          source=source)

<P>

<DT>Tag(<I>node</I>, <I>tags</I>)

<DD>
Annotates file or directory Nodes with
information about how the

Builder should package those files or directories.
All tags are optional.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# makes sure the built library will be installed with 0644 file
# access mode
Tag( Library( 'lib.c' ), UNIX_ATTR=&quot;0644&quot; )

<DT>TargetSignatures(<I>type</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.TargetSignatures(<I>type</I>)

<DD>
Note:  Although it is not yet officially deprecated,
use of this function is discouraged.
See the
<B>Decider</B>()

function for a more flexible and straightforward way
to configure SCons' decision-making.
<P>
The
<B>TargetSignatures</B>()

function tells
<B>scons</B>

how to decide if a target file
(a file that
<I>is</I>

built from any other files)
has changed since the last time it
was used to build some other target file.
Legal values are
<B>build</B>;

<B>content</B>

(or its synonym
<B>MD5</B>);

<B>timestamp</B>;

or
<B>source</B>.

<P>
If the environment method is used,
the specified type of target signature is only used
for targets built with that environment.
If the global function is used,
the specified type of signature becomes the default
used for all target files that
don't have an explicit target signature type
specified for their environments.
<P>
<B>content</B>

(or its synonym
<B>MD5</B>)

means
<B>scons</B>

decides that a target file has changed
if the MD5 checksum of its contents has changed since
the last time it was used to rebuild some other target file.
This means
<B>scons</B>

will open up
MD5 sum the contents
of target files after they're built,
and may decide that it does not need to rebuild
&quot;downstream&quot; target files if a file was
rebuilt with exactly the same contents as the last time.
<P>
<B>timestamp</B>

means
<B>scons</B>

decides that a target file has changed
if its timestamp (modification time) has changed since
the last time it was used to rebuild some other target file.
(Note that although this is similar to the behavior of Make,
by default it will also rebuild if the dependency is
<I>older</I>

than the last time it was used to rebuild the target file.)
<P>
<B>source</B>

means
<B>scons</B>

decides that a target file has changed
as specified by the corresponding
<B>SourceSignatures</B>()

setting
(<B>MD5</B>

or
<B>timestamp</B>).

This means that
<B>scons</B>

will treat all input files to a target the same way,
regardless of whether they are source files
or have been built from other files.
<P>
<B>build</B>

means
<B>scons</B>

decides that a target file has changed
if it has been rebuilt in this invocation
or if its content or timestamp have changed
as specified by the corresponding
<B>SourceSignatures</B>()

setting.
This &quot;propagates&quot; the status of a rebuilt file
so that other &quot;downstream&quot; target files
will always be rebuilt,
even if the contents or the timestamp
have not changed.
<P>
<B>build</B>

signatures are fastest because
<B>content</B>

(or
<B>MD5</B>)

signatures take longer to compute,
but are more accurate than
<B>timestamp</B>

signatures,
and can prevent unnecessary &quot;downstream&quot; rebuilds
when a target file is rebuilt to the exact same contents
as the previous build.
The
<B>source</B>

setting provides the most consistent behavior
when other target files may be rebuilt from
both source and target input files.
The default value is
<B>source</B>.

<P>
Because the default setting is
<B>source</B>,

using
<B>SourceSignatures</B>()

is generally preferable to
<B>TargetSignatures</B>(),

so that the up-to-date decision
will be consistent for all files
(or all files built with a specific construction environment).
Use of
<B>TargetSignatures</B>()

provides specific control for how built target files
affect their &quot;downstream&quot; dependencies.

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Tool(<I>string</I>, [<I>toolpath</I>, **<I>kw</I>])

<DD>
The
<B>Tool</B>()

form of the function
returns a callable object
that can be used to initialize
a construction environment using the
tools keyword of the Environment() method.
The object may be called with a construction
environment as an argument,
in which case the object will
add the necessary variables
to the construction environment
and the name of the tool will be added to the
<B>$TOOLS</B>

construction variable.
<P>
Additional keyword arguments are passed to the tool's
<B>generate</B>()

method.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DT><DD>
The

<DT>Value(<I>value</I>, [<I>built_value</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.Value(<I>value</I>, [<I>built_value</I>])

<DD>
Returns a Node object representing the specified Python value.  Value
Nodes can be used as dependencies of targets.  If the result of
calling
<B>str(</B><I>value</I><B>)</B>

changes between SCons runs, any targets depending on
<B>Value(</B><I>value</I><B>)</B>

will be rebuilt.
(This is true even when using timestamps to decide if
files are up-to-date.)
When using timestamp source signatures, Value Nodes'
timestamps are equal to the system time when the Node is created.
<P>
The returned Value Node object has a
<B>write</B>()

method that can be used to &quot;build&quot; a Value Node
by setting a new value.
The optional
<I>built_value</I>

argument can be specified
when the Value Node is created
to indicate the Node should already be considered
&quot;built.&quot;
There is a corresponding
<B>read</B>()

method that will return the built value of the Node.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment()

def create(target, source, env):
    # A function that will write a 'prefix=$SOURCE'
    # string into the file name specified as the

<DD>
<DT><I>env</I>.VariantDir(<I>variant_dir</I>, <I>src_dir</I>, [<I>duplicate</I>])

<DD>
Use the
<B>VariantDir</B>()

function to create a copy of your sources in another location:
if a name under
<I>variant_dir</I>

is not found but exists under
<I>src_dir</I>,

the file or directory is copied to
<I>variant_dir</I>.

Target files can be built in a different directory
than the original sources by simply refering to the sources (and targets)
within the variant tree.
<P>
<B>VariantDir</B>()

can be called multiple times with the same
<I>src_dir</I>

to set up multiple builds with different options
(<I>variants</I>).

The
<I>src_dir</I>

location must be in or underneath the SConstruct file's directory, and
<I>variant_dir</I>

may not be underneath
<I>src_dir</I>.

<P>
The default behavior is for
<B>scons</B>

to physically duplicate the source files in the variant tree.
Thus, a build performed in the variant tree is guaranteed to be identical
to a build performed in the source tree even if
intermediate source files are generated during the build,
or preprocessors or other scanners search for included files
relative to the source file,
or individual compilers or other invoked tools are hard-coded
to put derived files in the same directory as source files.
<P>
If possible on the platform,
the duplication is performed by linking rather than copying;
see also the
<B>--duplicate</B>

command-line option.
Moreover, only the files needed for the build are duplicated;
files and directories that are not used are not present in
<I>variant_dir</I>.

<P>
Duplicating the source tree may be disabled by setting the
<B>duplicate</B>

argument to
<B>0</B>

(zero).
This will cause
<B>scons</B>

to invoke Builders using the path names of source files in
<I>src_dir</I>

and the path names of derived files within
<I>variant_dir</I>.

This is always more efficient than
<B>duplicate=1</B>,

and is usually safe for most builds
(but see above for cases that may cause problems).
<P>
Note that
<B>VariantDir</B>()

works most naturally with a subsidiary SConscript file.
However, you would then call the subsidiary SConscript file
not in the source directory, but in the
<I>variant_dir</I>,

regardless of the value of
<B>duplicate</B>.

This is how you tell
<B>scons</B>

which variant of a source tree to build:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# run src/SConscript in two variant directories
VariantDir('build/variant1', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant1/SConscript')
VariantDir('build/variant2', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant2/SConscript')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
See also the
<B>SConscript</B>()

function, described above,
for another way to specify a variant directory
in conjunction with calling a subsidiary SConscript file.

<H3>SConscript Variables</H3>

In addition to the global functions and methods,
<B>scons</B>

supports a number of Python variables
that can be used in SConscript files
to affect how you want the build to be performed.
These variables may be accessed from custom Python modules that you
import into an SConscript file by adding the following
to the Python module:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
from SCons.Script import *

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>ARGLIST<DD>
A list
<I>keyword</I>=<I>value</I>

arguments specified on the command line.
Each element in the list is a tuple
containing the
(<I>keyword</I>,<I>value</I>)

of the argument.
The separate
<I>keyword</I>

and
<I>value</I>

elements of the tuple
can be accessed by
subscripting for element
<B>[0]</B>

and
<B>[1]</B>

of the tuple, respectively.

<P>

<DT>ARGUMENTS<DD>
A dictionary of all the

arguments specified on the command line.
The dictionary is not in order,
and if a given keyword has
more than one value assigned to it
on the command line,
the last (right-most) value is
the one in the

<DT>BUILD_TARGETS<DD>
A list of the targets which
<B>scons</B>

will actually try to build,
regardless of whether they were specified on
the command line or via the
<B>Default</B>()

function or method.
The elements of this list may be strings
<I>or</I>

nodes, so you should run the list through the Python
<B>str</B>

function to make sure any Node path names
are converted to strings.
<P>
Because this list may be taken from the
list of targets specified using the
<B>Default</B>()

function or method,
the contents of the list may change
on each successive call to
<B>Default</B>().

See the
<B>DEFAULT_TARGETS</B>

list, below,
for additional information.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

    print &quot;Don't forget to test the `foo' program!&quot;
if 'special/program' in BUILD_TARGETS:

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Note that the
<B>BUILD_TARGETS</B>

list only contains targets expected listed
on the command line or via calls to the
<B>Default</B>()

function or method.
It does
<I>not</I>

contain all dependent targets that will be built as
a result of making the sure the explicitly-specified
targets are up to date.
<P>

<DT>COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS<DD>
A list of the targets explicitly specified on
the command line.
If there are no targets specified on the command line,
the list is empty.
This can be used, for example,
to take specific actions only
when a certain target or targets
is explicitly being built.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
if 'foo' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:

</DL>


<P>

<DT>DEFAULT_TARGETS<DD>
A list of the target
<I>nodes</I>

that have been specified using the
<B>Default</B>()

function or method.
The elements of the list are nodes,
so you need to run them through the Python
<B>str</B>

function to get at the path name for each Node.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
print str(DEFAULT_TARGETS[0])
if 'foo' in map(str, DEFAULT_TARGETS):
    print &quot;Don't forget to test the `foo' program!&quot;

<DT><DD>
Consequently, be sure to use
<B>DEFAULT_TARGETS</B>

only after you've made all of your
<B>Default</B>()

calls,

so that you don't look for a specific
default target before it's actually been added to the list.

<H3>Construction Variables</H3>

















A construction environment has an associated dictionary of

<DT>CC<DD>
The C compiler.
<P>
<DT>CCCOM<DD>
The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static) object
file.  Any options specified in the <B>$CFLAGS</B>, <B>$CCFLAGS</B> and
<B>$CPPFLAGS</B> construction variables are included on this command
line.
<P>
<DT>CCCOMSTR<DD>
The string displayed when a C source file

<P>
<DT>CCFLAGS<DD>
General options that are passed to the C and C++ compilers.
<P>
<DT>CCPCHFLAGS<DD>
Options added to the compiler command line
to support building with precompiled headers.
The default value expands expands to the appropriate
Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options
when the <B>$PCH</B> construction variable is set.
<P>
<DT>CCPDBFLAGS<DD>
Options added to the compiler command line
to support storing debugging information in a
Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file.
The default value expands expands to appropriate
Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options
when the <B>$PDB</B> construction variable is set.
<P>
The Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by default
to generate PDB information is <B>/Z7</B>.
This works correctly with parallel (<B>-j</B>) builds
because it embeds the debug information in the intermediate object files,
as opposed to sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files.
This is also the only way to get debug information
embedded into a static library.
Using the <B>/Zi</B> instead may yield improved
link-time performance,
although parallel builds will no longer work.
<P>
You can generate PDB files with the <B>/Zi</B>
switch by overriding the default <B>$CCPDBFLAGS</B> variable as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = ['${(PDB and &quot;/Zi /Fd%s&quot; % File(PDB)) or &quot;&quot;}']

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
An alternative would be to use the <B>/Zi</B>
to put the debugging information in a separate <B>.pdb</B>
file for each object file by overriding
the <B>$CCPDBFLAGS</B> variable as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = '/Zi /Fd${TARGET}.pdb'

when generating C files from Lex (.l) or YACC (.y) input files.
The default suffix, of course, is
<B>.c</B>

(lower case).
On case-insensitive systems (like Windows),
SCons also treats
<B>.C</B>

(upper case) files
as C files.
<P>
<DT>CFLAGS<DD>
General options that are passed to the C compiler (C only; not C++).
<P>
<DT>CHANGE_SPECFILE<DD>
A hook for modifying the file that controls the packaging build

<P>
<DT>CPPPATH<DD>
The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for include
directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will search these

A dictionary of environment variables
to use when invoking commands. When
<B>$ENV</B> is used in a command all list
values will be joined using the path separator and any other non-string

Note that, by default,
<B>scons</B>

does
<I>not</I>

propagate the environment in force when you
execute
<B>scons</B>

to the commands used to build target files.
This is so that builds will be guaranteed
repeatable regardless of the environment
variables set at the time
<B>scons</B>

is invoked.

<DT>MSVC_BATCH<DD>
When set to any true value,
specifies that SCons should batch
compilation of object files
when calling the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler.
All compilations of source files from the same source directory
that generate target files in a same output directory
and were configured in SCons using the same construction environment
will be built in a single call to the compiler.
Only source files that have changed since their
object files were built will be passed to each compiler invocation
(via the <B>$CHANGED_SOURCES</B> construction variable).
Any compilations where the object (target) file base name
(minus the <B>.obj</B>)

If set to the name of a Visual Studio .bat file (e.g. vcvars.bat),
SCons will run that bat file and extract the relevant variables from
the result (typically %INCLUDE%, %LIB%, and %PATH%).  Setting
MSVC_USE_SCRIPT to None bypasses the Visual Studio autodetection
entirely; use this if you are running SCons in a Visual Studio cmd
window and importing the shell's environment variables.
<P>
<DT>MSVC_VERSION<DD>
Sets the preferred  version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ to use.
<P>
If <B>$MSVC_VERSION</B> is not set, SCons will (by default) select the
latest version of Visual C/C++ installed on your system.  If the
specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will fail.
This variable must be passed as an argument to the Environment()
constructor; setting it later has no effect.  Set it to an unexpected
value (e.g. &quot;XXX&quot;) to see the valid values on your system.
<P>
<DT>MSVS<DD>
When the Microsoft Visual Studio tools are initialized, they set up

<P>
<DT>MSVS_ARCH<DD>
Sets the architecture for which the generated project(s) should build.
<P>
The default value is <B>x86</B>.
<B>amd64</B> is also supported
by &amp;SCons; for some Visual Studio versions.
Trying to set <B>$MSVS_ARCH</B> to an architecture that's not
supported for a given Visual Studio version
will generate an error.
<P>
<DT>MSVS_PROJECT_GUID<DD>
The string
placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project file

There is no default value.
<P>
<DT>MSVS_SCC_CONNECTION_ROOT<DD>
The root path of projects in your SCC workspace, i.e the path under which
all project and solution files will be generated. It is used as a
reference path from which the relative paths of the generated
Microsoft Visual Studio project and solution files are computed.
The relative project file path is placed as the value of the
<B>SccLocalPath</B>

attribute
of the project file
and as the values of the
<B>SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection[i]</B>

(where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of projects in the solution)
attributes of the
<B>GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl)</B>

section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.
Similarly the relative solution file path is placed as the values of the
<B>SccLocalPath[i]</B>

(where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of projects in the solution)
attributes of the
<B>GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl)</B>

section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.

section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.
There is no default value.
<P>
<DT>MSVS_VERSION<DD>
Sets the preferred version of Microsoft Visual Studio to use.
<P>
If <B>$MSVS_VERSION</B> is not set,
&amp;SCons; will (by default) select the latest version
of Visual Studio installed on your system.
So, if you have version 6 and version 7 (MSVS .NET) installed,
it will prefer version 7.
You can override this by
specifying the
<B>MSVS_VERSION</B>

variable in the Environment initialization, setting it to the
appropriate version ('6.0' or '7.0', for example).
If the specified version isn't installed,
tool initialization will fail.
<P>
This is obsolete: use <B>$MSVC_VERSION</B> instead. If <B>$MSVS_VERSION</B> is set and
<B>$MSVC_VERSION</B>is<B>not,</B><B>$MSVC_VERSION</B><B>will</B>be<B>set</B>automatically<B>to</B><B>$MSVS_VERSION.</B>

<P>
<BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;msi&nbsp;-&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Installer
<BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;rpm&nbsp;-&nbsp;Redhat&nbsp;Package&nbsp;Manger
<BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;ipkg&nbsp;-&nbsp;Itsy&nbsp;Package&nbsp;Management&nbsp;System

<BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;src_zip&nbsp;-&nbsp;zip&nbsp;file&nbsp;source
<P>
This may be overridden with the &quot;package_type&quot; command line option.
<P>
<DT>PACKAGEVERSION<DD>
The version of the package (not the underlying project).
This is currently only used by the rpm packager
and should reflect changes in the packaging,
not the underlying project code itself.
<P>
<DT>PCH<DD>
The Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header that will be used when compiling
object files. This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++.
When this variable is
defined SCons will add options to the compiler command line to
cause it to use the precompiled header, and will also set up the
dependencies for the PCH file.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env['PCH'] = 'StdAfx.pch'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>PCHCOM<DD>
The command line used by the
<B>PCH</B>()

builder to generated a precompiled header.
<P>
<DT>PCHCOMSTR<DD>
The string displayed when generating a precompiled header.
If this is not set, then <B>$PCHCOM</B> (the command line) is displayed.
<P>
<DT>PCHPDBFLAGS<DD>
A construction variable that, when expanded,
adds the <B>/yD</B> flag to the command line
only if the <B>$PDB</B> construction variable is set.
<P>
<DT>PCHSTOP<DD>
This variable specifies how much of a source file is precompiled. This
variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++, or when
the PCH variable is not being used. When this variable is define it
must be a string that is the name of the header that
is included at the end of the precompiled portion of the source files, or
the empty string if the &quot;#pragma hrdstop&quot; construct is being used:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>PDB<DD>
The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging information for
object files, shared libraries, and programs. This variable is ignored by
tools other than Microsoft Visual C++.
When this variable is
defined SCons will add options to the compiler and linker command line to
cause them to generate external debugging information, and will also set up the
dependencies for the PDB file.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env['PDB'] = 'hello.pdb'

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default
to generate PDB information is <B>/Z7</B>.
This works correctly with parallel (<B>-j</B>) builds
because it embeds the debug information in the intermediate object files,
as opposed to sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files.
This is also the only way to get debug information
embedded into a static library.
Using the <B>/Zi</B> instead may yield improved
link-time performance,
although parallel builds will no longer work.
You can generate PDB files with the <B>/Zi</B>
switch by overriding the default <B>$CCPDBFLAGS</B> variable;
see the entry for that variable for specific examples.
<P>

no <B>POT</B> file name is provided by the user. This applies to
<B>POTUpdate</B>(), <B>POInit</B>() and <B>POUpdate</B>() builders (and
builders, that use them, e.g. <B>Translate</B>()). Normally (if <B>$POTDOMAIN</B> is

the command being executed (a string),
<I>target</I>,

the target being built (file node, list, or string name(s)),
<I>source</I>,

the source(s) used (file node, list, or string name(s)), and
<I>env</I>,

the environment being used.
<P>
The function must do the printing itself.  The default implementation,
used if this variable is not set or is None, is:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
  sys.stdout.write(s + &quot;\n&quot;)

you have to explicitly specify it at Environment creation:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Environment(tools=['default','qt'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The qt tool supports the following operations:
<P>
<I>Automatic moc file generation from header files.</I>

You do not have to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you.
However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header file must have
the same filebase as your implementation file and must stay in the same
directory. It must have one of the suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You
can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0.
See also the corresponding
<B>Moc()</B>()

builder method.
<P>
<I>Automatic moc file generation from cxx files.</I>

As stated in the qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of
the cxx file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated
by the transformation ${QT_MOCCXXPREFIX}&lt;basename&gt;${QT_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
&lt;basename&gt;.moc. A warning is generated after building the moc file, if you
do not include the correct file. If you are using VariantDir, you may
need to specify duplicate=1. You can turn off automatic moc file generation
by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0. See also the corresponding
<B>Moc</B>()

builder method.
<P>
<I>Automatic handling of .ui files.</I>

The implementation files generated from .ui files are handled much the same
as yacc or lex files. Each .ui file given as a source of Program, Library or
SharedLibrary will generate three files, the declaration file, the
implementation file and a moc file. Because there are also generated headers,
you may need to specify duplicate=1 in calls to VariantDir.

<P>
<DT>YACCHFILESUFFIX<DD>
The suffix of the C

Note that setting this variable does not cause
the parser generator to generate a header
file with the specified suffix,
it exists to allow you to specify

The default value is
<B>.h</B>.

<P>
<DT>YACCHXXFILESUFFIX<DD>
The suffix of the C++
header file generated by the parser generator
when the
<B>-d</B>

option is used.
Note that setting this variable does not cause
the parser generator to generate a header
file with the specified suffix,
it exists to allow you to specify
what suffix the parser generator will use of its own accord.
The default value is
<B>.hpp</B>,

except on Mac OS X,

<H3>Configure Contexts</H3>

<P>
<B>scons</B>

supports
<I>configure contexts,</I>

an integrated mechanism similar to the
various AC_CHECK macros in GNU autoconf
for testing for the existence of C header
files, libraries, etc.
In contrast to autoconf,
<B>scons</B>

does not maintain an explicit cache of the tested values,
but uses its normal dependency tracking to keep the checked values
up to date. However, users may override this behaviour with the
<B>--config</B>

command line option.
<P>
The following methods can be used to perform checks:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Configure(<I>env</I>, [<I>custom_tests</I>, <I>conf_dir</I>, <I>log_file</I>, <I>config_h</I>, <I>clean</I>, <I>help])</I>

<DD>
<DT>env.Configure([<I>custom_tests</I>, <I>conf_dir</I>, <I>log_file</I>, <I>config_h</I>, <I>clean</I>, <I>help])</I>

<DD>
This creates a configure context, which can be used to perform checks.
<I>env</I>

specifies the environment for building the tests.
This environment may be modified when performing checks.
<I>custom_tests</I>

is a dictionary containing custom tests.
See also the section about custom tests below.
By default, no custom tests are added to the configure context.
<I>conf_dir</I>

specifies a directory where the test cases are built.
Note that this directory is not used for building
normal targets.
The default value is the directory
#/.sconf_temp.
<I>log_file</I>

specifies a file which collects the output from commands
that are executed to check for the existence of header files, libraries, etc.
The default is the file #/config.log.
If you are using the
<B>VariantDir</B>()

method,
you may want to specify a subdirectory under your variant directory.
<I>config_h</I>

specifies a C header file where the results of tests
will be written, e.g. #define HAVE_STDIO_H, #define HAVE_LIBM, etc.
The default is to not write a
<B>config.h</B>

file.
You can specify the same
<B>config.h</B>

file in multiple calls to Configure,
in which case
<B>scons</B>

will concatenate all results in the specified file.
Note that SCons
uses its normal dependency checking
to decide if it's necessary to rebuild
the specified
<I>config_h</I>

file.
This means that the file is not necessarily re-built each
time scons is run,
but is only rebuilt if its contents will have changed
and some target that depends on the
<I>config_h</I>

file is being built.
<P>
The optional
<B>clean</B>

and
<B>help</B>

arguments can be used to suppress execution of the configuration
tests when the
<B>-c/--clean</B>

or
<B>-H/-h/--help</B>

options are used, respectively.
The default behavior is always to execute
configure context tests,
since the results of the tests may
affect the list of targets to be cleaned
or the help text.
If the configure tests do not affect these,
then you may add the
<B>clean=False</B>

or
<B>help=False</B>

arguments
(or both)
to avoid unnecessary test execution.
<P>




A created
<B>Configure</B>

instance has the following associated methods:
<P>
<DT>SConf.Finish(<I>context</I>)

<DD>
<DT><I>sconf</I>.Finish()

<DD>
This method should be called after configuration is done.
It returns the environment as modified
by the configuration checks performed.
After this method is called, no further checks can be performed
with this configuration context.
However, you can create a new
Configure

context to perform additional checks.
Only one context should be active at a time.
<P>
The following Checks are predefined.
(This list will likely grow larger as time
goes by and developers contribute new useful tests.)
<P>
<DT>SConf.CheckHeader(<I>context</I>, <I>header</I>, [<I>include_quotes</I>, <I>language</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>sconf</I>.CheckHeader(<I>header</I>, [<I>include_quotes</I>, <I>language</I>])

<DD>
Checks if
<I>header</I>

is usable in the specified language.
<I>header</I>

may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list
is the header file to be checked,
and the previous list items are
header files whose
<B>#include</B>

lines should precede the
header line being checked for.
The optional argument
<I>include_quotes</I>

must be
a two character string, where the first character denotes the opening
quote and the second character denotes the closing quote.
By default, both characters  are &quot; (double quote).
The optional argument
<I>language</I>

should be either
<B>C</B>

or
<B>C++</B>

and selects the compiler to be used for the check.
Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

<DT>SConf.CheckCHeader(<I>context</I>, <I>header</I>, [<I>include_quotes</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>sconf</I>.CheckCHeader(<I>header</I>, [<I>include_quotes</I>])

<DD>
This is a wrapper around
<B>SConf.CheckHeader</B>

which checks if
<I>header</I>

is usable in the C language.
<I>header</I>

may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list

The optional argument
<I>include_quotes</I>

must be

Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
<P>
<DT>SConf.CheckFunc(<I>context,</I>, <I>function_name</I>, [<I>header</I>, <I>language</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>sconf</I>.CheckFunc(<I>function_name</I>, [<I>header</I>, <I>language</I>])

<DD>
Checks if the specified
C or C++ function is available.
<I>function_name</I>

is the name of the function to check for.
The optional
<I>header</I>

argument is a string
that will be
placed at the top

that will be compiled
to check if the function exists;
the default is:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
#ifdef __cplusplus

#endif
char function_name();

</PRE>

</DL>


The optional
<I>language</I>

<B>C</B>

or
<B>C++</B>

and selects the compiler to be used for the check;
the default is &quot;C&quot;.
<P>
<DT>SConf.CheckLib(<I>context</I>, [<I>library</I>, <I>symbol</I>, <I>header</I>, <I>language</I>, <I>autoadd=1</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>sconf</I>.CheckLib([<I>library</I>, <I>symbol</I>, <I>header</I>, <I>language</I>, <I>autoadd=1</I>])

<DD>
Checks if
<I>library</I>

provides
<I>symbol</I>.

If the value of
<I>autoadd</I>

is 1 and the library provides the specified
<I>symbol</I>,

appends the library to the LIBS construction environment variable.
<I>library</I>

may also be None (the default),
in which case
<I>symbol</I>

is checked with the current LIBS variable,
or a list of library names,
in which case each library in the list
will be checked for
<I>symbol</I>.

If
<I>symbol</I>

is not set or is
<B>None</B>,

then
<B>SConf.CheckLib</B>()

just checks if
you can link against the specified
<I>library</I>.

The optional
<I>language</I>

argument should be
<B>C</B>

or
<B>C++</B>

and selects the compiler to be used for the check;
the default is &quot;C&quot;.
The default value for
<I>autoadd</I>

is 1.
This method returns 1 on success and 0 on error.
<P>
<DT>SConf.CheckLibWithHeader(<I>context</I>, <I>library</I>, <I>header</I>, <I>language</I>, [<I>call</I>, <I>autoadd</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>sconf</I>.CheckLibWithHeader(<I>library</I>, <I>header</I>, <I>language</I>, [<I>call</I>, <I>autoadd</I>])

<DD>
<P>
In contrast to the
SConf.CheckLib

call, this call provides a more sophisticated way to check against libraries.
Again,
<I>library</I>

specifies the library or a list of libraries to check.
<I>header</I>

specifies a header to check for.
<I>header</I>

may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list
is the header file to be checked,
and the previous list items are
header files whose
<B>#include</B>

lines should precede the
header line being checked for.
<I>language</I>

may be one of 'C','c','CXX','cxx','C++' and 'c++'.
<I>call</I>

can be any valid expression (with a trailing ';').
If
<I>call</I>

is not set,
the default simply checks that you
can link against the specified
<I>library</I>.

<I>autoadd</I>

specifies whether to add the library to the environment (only if the check
succeeds). This method returns 1 on success and 0 on error.
<P>
<DT>SConf.CheckType(<I>context</I>, <I>type_name</I>, [<I>includes</I>, <I>language</I>])

<DD>
<DT><I>sconf</I>.CheckType(<I>type_name</I>, [<I>includes</I>, <I>language</I>])

<DD>
Checks for the existence of a type defined by
<B>typedef</B>.

<I>type_name</I>

specifies the typedef name to check for.
<I>includes</I>

is a string containing one or more
<B>#include</B>

lines that will be inserted into the program
that will be run to test for the existence of the type.
The optional
<I>language</I>

argument should be
<B>C</B>

or
<B>C++</B>

and selects the compiler to be used for the check;
the default is &quot;C&quot;.
Example:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
sconf.CheckType('foo_type', '#include &quot;my_types.h&quot;', 'C++')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckCC(<I>self</I>)

<DD>
Checks whether the C compiler (as defined by the CC construction variable) works
by trying to compile a small source file.
<P>
By default, SCons only detects if there is a program with the correct name, not
if it is a functioning compiler.
<P>
This uses the exact same command than the one used by the object builder for C
source file, so it can be used to detect if a particular compiler flag works or
not.
<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckCXX(<I>self</I>)

<DD>
Checks whether the C++ compiler (as defined by the CXX construction variable)
works by trying to compile a small source file. By default, SCons only detects
if there is a program with the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler.
<P>
This uses the exact same command than the one used by the object builder for
CXX source files, so it can be used to detect if a particular compiler flag
works or not.
<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckSHCC(<I>self</I>)

<DD>
Checks whether the C compiler (as defined by the SHCC construction variable) works
by trying to compile a small source file. By default, SCons only detects if
there is a program with the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler.
<P>
This uses the exact same command than the one used by the object builder for C
source file, so it can be used to detect if a particular compiler flag works or
not. This does not check whether the object code can be used to build a shared
library, only that the compilation (not link) succeeds.
<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckSHCXX(<I>self</I>)

<DD>
Checks whether the C++ compiler (as defined by the SHCXX construction variable)
works by trying to compile a small source file. By default, SCons only detects
if there is a program with the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler.
<P>
This uses the exact same command than the one used by the object builder for
CXX source files, so it can be used to detect if a particular compiler flag
works or not. This does not check whether the object code can be used to build

<I>type_name</I>

specifies the typedef name to check for.
The optional

that will be compiled
to check if the function exists;
the default is empty.
The optional

If this argument is used,
the function will only check whether the type
given in type_name has the expected size (in bytes).
For example,
<B>CheckTypeSize('short', expect = 2)</B>

will return success only if short is two bytes.

You can define your own custom checks.
in addition to the predefined checks.
These are passed in a dictionary to the Configure function.
This dictionary maps the names of the checks
to user defined Python callables
(either Python functions or class instances implementing the
<I>__call__</I>

method).
The first argument of the call is always a
<I>CheckContext</I>

instance followed by the arguments,
which must be supplied by the user of the check.
These CheckContext instances define the following methods:
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.Message(<I>self</I>, <I>text</I>)

<DD>
<P>
Usually called before the check is started.
<I>text</I>

will be displayed to the user, e.g. 'Checking for library X...'
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.Result(<I>self,</I>, <I>res</I>)

<DD>
<P>
Usually called after the check is done.
<I>res</I>

can be either an integer or a string. In the former case, 'yes' (res != 0)
or 'no' (res == 0) is displayed to the user, in the latter case the
given string is displayed.
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.TryCompile(<I>self</I>, <I>text</I>, <I>extension</I>)

<DD>
Checks if a file with the specified
<I>extension</I>

(e.g. '.c') containing
<I>text</I>

can be compiled using the environment's
<B>Object</B>

builder. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.TryLink(<I>self</I>, <I>text</I>, <I>extension</I>)

<DD>
Checks, if a file with the specified
<I>extension</I>

(e.g. '.c') containing
<I>text</I>

can be compiled using the environment's
<B>Program</B>

builder. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.TryRun(<I>self</I>, <I>text</I>, <I>extension</I>)

<DD>
Checks, if a file with the specified
<I>extension</I>

(e.g. '.c') containing
<I>text</I>

can be compiled using the environment's
<B>Program</B>

builder. On success, the program is run. If the program
executes successfully
(that is, its return status is 0),
a tuple
<I>(1, outputStr)</I>

is returned, where
<I>outputStr</I>

is the standard output of the
program.
If the program fails execution
(its return status is non-zero),
then (0, '') is returned.
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.TryAction(<I>self</I>, <I>action</I>, [<I>text</I>, <I>extension</I>])

<DD>
Checks if the specified
<I>action</I>

with an optional source file (contents
<I>text</I>

, extension
<I>extension</I>

) can be executed.
<I>action</I>

may be anything which can be converted to a
<B>scons</B>

Action.

On success,
<I>(1, outputStr)</I>

is returned, where
<I>outputStr</I>

is the content of the target file.
On failure
<I>(0, '')</I>

is returned.
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.TryBuild(<I>self</I>, <I>builder</I>, [<I>text</I>, <I>extension</I>])

<DD>
Low level implementation for testing specific builds;
the methods above are based on this method.
Given the Builder instance
<I>builder</I>

and the optional
<I>text</I>

of a source file with optional
<I>extension</I>,

this method returns 1 on success and 0 on failure. In addition,
<I>self.lastTarget</I>

is set to the build target node, if the build was successful.

<H3>Command-Line Construction Variables</H3>

<P>
Often when building software,
some variables must be specified at build time.
For example, libraries needed for the build may be in non-standard
locations, or site-specific compiler options may need to be passed to the
compiler.
<B>scons</B>

provides a
<B>Variables</B>

object to support overriding construction variables
on the command line:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$ scons VARIABLE=foo

</PRE>

</DL>


The variable values can also be specified in a text-based SConscript file.
To create a Variables object, call the Variables() function:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Variables([<I>files</I>], [<I>args</I>])

<DD>
This creates a Variables object that will read construction variables from
the file or list of filenames specified in
<I>files</I>.

If no files are specified,
or the
<I>files</I>

argument is
<B>None</B>,

then no files will be read.
The optional argument
<I>args</I>

is a dictionary of
values that will override anything read from the specified files;
it is primarily intended to be passed the
<B>ARGUMENTS</B>

dictionary that holds variables
specified on the command line.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars = Variables('overrides.py', ARGUMENTS)
vars = Variables(None, {FOO:'expansion', BAR:7})

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Variables objects have the following methods:
<P>
<DT>Add(<I>key</I>, [<I>help</I>, <I>default</I>, <I>validator</I>, <I>converter</I>])

<DD>
This adds a customizable construction variable to the Variables object.
<I>key</I>

is the name of the variable.
<I>help</I>

is the help text for the variable.
<I>default</I>

is the default value of the variable;
if the default value is
<B>None</B>

and there is no explicit value specified,
the construction variable will
<I>not</I>

be added to the construction environment.
<I>validator</I>

is called to validate the value of the variable, and should take three
arguments: key, value, and environment.
The recommended way to handle an invalid value is
to raise an exception (see example below).
<I>converter</I>

is called to convert the value before putting it in the environment, and
should take either a value, or the value and environment, as parameters.
The
<I>converter</I>

must return a value,
which will be converted into a string
before being validated by the
<I>validator</I>

(if any)
and then added to the environment.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
vars.Add('CC', 'The C compiler')

def validate_color(key, val, env):
    if not val in ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']:
        raise Exception(&quot;Invalid color value '%s'&quot; % val)
vars.Add('COLOR', validator=valid_color)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>AddVariables(<I>list</I>)

<DD>
A wrapper script that adds
multiple customizable construction variables
to a Variables object.
<I>list</I>

is a list of tuple or list objects
that contain the arguments
for an individual call to the
<B>Add</B>

method.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
opt.AddVariables(
       ('debug', '', 0),
       ('CC', 'The C compiler'),
       ('VALIDATE', 'An option for testing validation',
        'notset', validator, None),
    )

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Update(<I>env</I>, [<I>args</I>])

<DD>
This updates a construction environment
<I>env</I>

with the customized construction variables.
Any specified variables that are
<I>not</I>

configured for the Variables object
will be saved and may be
retrieved with the
<B>UnknownVariables</B>()

method, below.
<P>
Normally this method is not called directly,
but is called indirectly by passing the Variables object to
the Environment() function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(variables=vars)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT><DD>
The text file(s) that were specified
when the Variables object was created
are executed as Python scripts,
and the values of (global) Python variables set in the file
are added to the construction environment.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
CC = 'my_cc'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>UnknownVariables(<I>)</I>

<DD>
Returns a dictionary containing any
variables that were specified
either in the files or the dictionary
with which the Variables object was initialized,
but for which the Variables object was
not configured.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(variables=vars)
for key, value in vars.UnknownVariables():
    print &quot;unknown variable:  %s=%s&quot; % (key, value)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Save(<I>filename</I>, <I>env</I>)

<DD>
This saves the currently set variables into a script file named
<I>filename</I>

that can be used on the next invocation to automatically load the current
settings.  This method combined with the Variables method can be used to
support caching of variables between runs.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment()
vars = Variables(['variables.cache', 'custom.py'])
vars.Add(...)
vars.Update(env)
vars.Save('variables.cache', env)

</DL>


<P>
<DT>GenerateHelpText(<I>env</I>, [<I>sort</I>])

<DD>
This generates help text documenting the customizable construction
variables suitable to passing in to the Help() function.
<I>env</I>

is the construction environment that will be used to get the actual values
of customizable variables. Calling with
an optional
<I>sort</I>

function
will cause the output to be sorted
by the specified argument.
The specific
<I>sort</I>

function
should take two arguments
and return
-1, 0 or 1
(like the standard Python
<I>cmp</I>

function).
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>FormatVariableHelpText(<I>env</I>, <I>opt</I>, <I>help</I>, <I>default</I>, <I>actual</I>)

<DD>
This method returns a formatted string
containing the printable help text
for one option.
It is normally not called directly,
but is called by the
<I>GenerateHelpText</I>()

method to create the returned help text.
It may be overridden with your own
function that takes the arguments specified above
and returns a string of help text formatted to your liking.
Note that the
<I>GenerateHelpText</I>()

will not put any blank lines or extra
characters in between the entries,
so you must add those characters to the returned
string if you want the entries separated.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def my_format(env, opt, help, default, actual):
    fmt = &quot;s: default=%s actual=%s (%s)

<P>
To make it more convenient to work with customizable Variables,
<B>scons</B>

provides a number of functions

various types of Variables:
<P>
<DT>BoolVariable(<I>key</I>, <I>help</I>, <I>default</I>)

<DD>
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up a Boolean option.
The option will use
the specified name
<I>key</I>,

have a default value of
<I>default</I>,

and display the specified
<I>help</I>

text.
The option will interpret the values
<B>y</B>,

<B>yes</B>,

<B>t</B>,

<B>true</B>,

<B>1</B>,

<B>on</B>

and
<B>all</B>

<B>n</B>,

<B>no</B>,

<B>f</B>,

<B>false</B>,

<B>0</B>,

<B>off</B>

and
<B>none</B>

as false.
<P>
<DT>EnumVariable(<I>key</I>, <I>help</I>, <I>default</I>, <I>allowed_values</I>, [<I>map</I>, <I>ignorecase</I>])

<DD>
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up an option
whose value may be one
of a specified list of legal enumerated values.
The option will use
the specified name
<I>key</I>,

have a default value of
<I>default</I>,

and display the specified
<I>help</I>

text.
The option will only support those
values in the
<I>allowed_values</I>

list.
The optional
<I>map</I>

argument is a dictionary
that can be used to convert
input values into specific legal values
in the
<I>allowed_values</I>

list.
If the value of
<I>ignore_case</I>

is
<B>0</B>

(the default),
then the values are case-sensitive.
If the value of
<I>ignore_case</I>

is
<B>1</B>,

then values will be matched
case-insensitive.
If the value of
<I>ignore_case</I>

is
<B>1</B>,

then values will be matched
case-insensitive,
and all input values will be
converted to lower case.
<P>
<DT>ListVariable(<I>key</I>, <I>help</I>, <I>default</I>, <I>names</I>, [,<I>map</I>])

<DD>
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up an option
whose value may be one or more
of a specified list of legal enumerated values.
The option will use
the specified name
<I>key</I>,

have a default value of
<I>default</I>,

and display the specified
<I>help</I>

text.
The option will only support the values
<B>all</B>,

<B>none</B>,

or the values in the
<I>names</I>

list.
More than one value may be specified,
with all values separated by commas.
The default may be a string of
comma-separated default values,
or a list of the default values.
The optional
<I>map</I>

argument is a dictionary
that can be used to convert
input values into specific legal values
in the
<I>names</I>

list.
<P>
<DT>PackageVariable(<I>key</I>, <I>help</I>, <I>default</I>)

<DD>
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up an option
whose value is a path name
of a package that may be
enabled, disabled or
given an explicit path name.
The option will use
the specified name
<I>key</I>,

have a default value of
<I>default</I>,

and display the specified
<I>help</I>

text.
The option will support the values
<B>yes</B>,

<B>true</B>,

<B>on</B>,

<B>enable</B>

or
<B>search</B>,

in which case the specified
<I>default</I>

will be used,
or the option may be set to an
arbitrary string
(typically the path name to a package
that is being enabled).
The option will also support the values
<B>no</B>,

<B>false</B>,

<B>off</B>

or
<B>disable</B>

to disable use of the specified option.
<P>
<DT>PathVariable(<I>key</I>, <I>help</I>, <I>default</I>, [<I>validator</I>])

<DD>
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up an option
whose value is expected to be a path name.
The option will use
the specified name
<I>key</I>,

have a default value of
<I>default</I>,

and display the specified
<I>help</I>

text.
An additional
<I>validator</I>

may be specified
that will be called to
verify that the specified path
is acceptable.
SCons supplies the
following ready-made validators:
<B>PathVariable.PathExists</B>

(the default),
which verifies that the specified path exists;
<B>PathVariable.PathIsFile</B>,

which verifies that the specified path is an existing file;
<B>PathVariable.PathIsDir</B>,

which verifies that the specified path is an existing directory;
<B>PathVariable.PathIsDirCreate</B>,

which verifies that the specified path is a directory
and will create the specified directory if the path does not exist;
and
<B>PathVariable.PathAccept</B>,

which simply accepts the specific path name argument without validation,
and which is suitable if you want your users
to be able to specify a directory path that will be
created as part of the build process, for example.
You may supply your own
<I>validator</I>

function,
which must take three arguments
(<I>key</I>,

the name of the variable to be set;
<I>val</I>,

the specified value being checked;
and
<I>env</I>,

the construction environment)
and should raise an exception
if the specified value is not acceptable.
<P>

These functions make it
convenient to create a number
of variables with consistent behavior
in a single call to the
<B>AddVariables</B>

<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXTENDING SCONS</H2>

<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Builder Objects</H3>

<B>scons</B>

can be extended to build different types of targets
by adding new Builder objects
to a construction environment.
<I>In general</I>,

you should only need to add a new Builder object
when you want to build a new type of file or other external target.
If you just want to invoke a different compiler or other tool
to build a Program, Object, Library, or any other
type of output file for which
<B>scons</B>

already has an existing Builder,
it is generally much easier to
use those existing Builders
in a construction environment
that sets the appropriate construction variables
(CC, LINK, etc.).
<P>
Builder objects are created
using the
<B>Builder</B>

function.
The
<B>Builder</B>

function accepts the following arguments:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>action<DD>
The command line string used to build the target from the source.
<B>action</B>

can also be:
a list of strings representing the command
to be executed and its arguments
(suitable for enclosing white space in an argument),
a dictionary
mapping source file name suffixes to
any combination of command line strings
(if the builder should accept multiple source file extensions),
a Python function;
an Action object
(see the next section);
or a list of any of the above.
<P>
An action function
takes three arguments:
<I>source</I>

- a list of source nodes,
<I>target</I>

- a list of target nodes,
<I>env</I>

- the construction environment.
<P>
<DT>prefix<DD>
The prefix that will be prepended to the target file name.
This may be specified as a:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
*
<I>string</I>,

<P>
<DT>
*
<I>callable object</I>

- a function or other callable that takes
<DD>two arguments (a construction environment and a list of sources)
and returns a prefix,
<P>
<DT>
*
<I>dictionary</I>

- specifies a mapping from a specific source suffix (of the first
<DD>source specified) to a corresponding target prefix.  Both the source
suffix and target prefix specifications may use environment variable
substitution, and the target prefix (the 'value' entries in the
dictionary) may also be a callable object.  The default target prefix
may be indicated by a dictionary entry with a key value of None.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>suffix<DD>
The suffix that will be appended to the target file name.
This may be specified in the same manner as the prefix above.
If the suffix is a string, then
<B>scons</B>

will append a '.' to the beginning of the suffix if it's not already
there.  The string returned by callable object (or obtained from the
dictionary) is untouched and must append its own '.'  to the beginning
if one is desired.

<DT>ensure_suffix<DD>
When set to any true value, causes
<B>scons</B>

to add the target suffix specified by the

keyword to any target strings
that have a different suffix.
(The default behavior is to leave untouched
any target file name that looks like it already has any suffix.)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>src_suffix<DD>
The expected source file name suffix.  This may be a string or a list
of strings.
<P>
<DT>target_scanner<DD>
A Scanner object that
will be invoked to find
implicit dependencies for this target file.
This keyword argument should be used
for Scanner objects that find
implicit dependencies
based only on the target file
and the construction environment,
<I>not</I>

for implicit dependencies based on source files.
(See the section &quot;Scanner Objects&quot; below,
for information about creating Scanner objects.)
<P>
<DT>source_scanner<DD>
A Scanner object that
will be invoked to
find implicit dependencies in
any source files
used to build this target file.
This is where you would
specify a scanner to
find things like
<B>#include</B>

lines in source files.
The pre-built
<B>DirScanner</B>

Scanner object may be used to
indicate that this Builder
should scan directory trees
for on-disk changes to files
that
<B>scons</B>

does not know about from other Builder or function calls.
(See the section &quot;Scanner Objects&quot; below,
for information about creating your own Scanner objects.)
<P>
<DT>target_factory<DD>
A factory function that the Builder will use
to turn any targets specified as strings into SCons Nodes.
By default,
SCons assumes that all targets are files.
Other useful target_factory
values include
<B>Dir</B>,

for when a Builder creates a directory target,
and
<B>Entry</B>,

for when a Builder can create either a file
or directory target.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
MakeDirectoryBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, target_factory=Dir)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'MakeDirectory':MakeDirectoryBuilder})
env.MakeDirectory('new_directory', [])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT><DD>
Note that the call to the MakeDirectory Builder
needs to specify an empty source list
to make the string represent the builder's target;
without that, it would assume the argument is the source,
and would try to deduce the target name from it,
which in the absence of an automatically-added prefix or suffix
would lead to a matching target and source name
and a circular dependency.
<P>
<DT>source_factory<DD>
A factory function that the Builder will use
to turn any sources specified as strings into SCons Nodes.
By default,
SCons assumes that all source are files.
Other useful source_factory
values include
<B>Dir</B>,

for when a Builder uses a directory as a source,
and
<B>Entry</B>,

for when a Builder can use files
or directories (or both) as sources.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
CollectBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, source_factory=Entry)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'Collect':CollectBuilder})
env.Collect('archive', ['directory_name', 'file_name'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>emitter<DD>
A function or list of functions to manipulate the target and source
lists before dependencies are established
and the target(s) are actually built.
<B>emitter</B>

can also be a string containing a construction variable to expand
to an emitter function or list of functions,
or a dictionary mapping source file suffixes
to emitter functions.
(Only the suffix of the first source file
is used to select the actual emitter function
from an emitter dictionary.)
<P>
An emitter function
takes three arguments:
<I>source</I>

- a list of source nodes,
<I>target</I>

- a list of target nodes,
<I>env</I>

- the construction environment.
An emitter must return a tuple containing two lists,
the list of targets to be built by this builder,
and the list of sources for this builder.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def e(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['foo.foo'], source + ['foo.src'])

# Simple association of an emitter function with a Builder.
b = Builder(&quot;my_build &lt; $TARGET &gt; $SOURCE&quot;,
            emitter = e)

def e2(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['bar.foo'], source + ['bar.src'])

# Simple association of a list of emitter functions with a Builder.
b = Builder(&quot;my_build &lt; $TARGET &gt; $SOURCE&quot;,
            emitter = [e, e2])

# Calling an emitter function through a construction variable.
env = Environment(MY_EMITTER = e)
b = Builder(&quot;my_build &lt; $TARGET &gt; $SOURCE&quot;,
            emitter = '$MY_EMITTER')

# Calling a list of emitter functions through a construction variable.
env = Environment(EMITTER_LIST = [e, e2])
b = Builder(&quot;my_build &lt; $TARGET &gt; $SOURCE&quot;,
            emitter = '$EMITTER_LIST')

# Associating multiple emitters with different file
# suffixes using a dictionary.
def e_suf1(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['another_target_file'], source)
def e_suf2(target, source, env):
    return (target, source + ['another_source_file'])
b = Builder(&quot;my_build &lt; $TARGET &gt; $SOURCE&quot;,
            emitter = {'.suf1' : e_suf1,
                       '.suf2' : e_suf2})

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>multi<DD>
Specifies whether this builder is allowed to be called multiple times for
the same target file(s). The default is 0, which means the builder
can not be called multiple times for the same target file(s). Calling a
builder multiple times for the same target simply adds additional source
files to the target; it is not allowed to change the environment associated
with the target, specify addition environment overrides, or associate a different
builder with the target.
<P>
<DT>env<DD>
A construction environment that can be used
to fetch source code using this Builder.
(Note that this environment is
<I>not</I>

used for normal builds of normal target files,
which use the environment that was
used to call the Builder for the target file.)
<P>
<DT>generator<DD>
A function that returns a list of actions that will be executed to build
the target(s) from the source(s).
The returned action(s) may be
an Action object, or anything that
can be converted into an Action object
(see the next section).
<P>
The generator function
takes four arguments:
<I>source</I>

- a list of source nodes,
<I>target</I>

- a list of target nodes,
<I>env</I>

- the construction environment,
<I>for_signature</I>

- a Boolean value that specifies
whether the generator is being called
for generating a build signature
(as opposed to actually executing the command).
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def g(source, target, env, for_signature):
    return [[&quot;gcc&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;-o&quot;] + target + source]

b = Builder(generator=g)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT><DD>
The
<I>generator</I>

and
<I>action</I>

arguments must not both be used for the same Builder.
<P>
<DT>src_builder<DD>
Specifies a builder to use when a source file name suffix does not match
any of the suffixes of the builder. Using this argument produces a
multi-stage builder.
<P>
<DT>single_source<DD>
Specifies that this builder expects exactly one source file per call. Giving
more than one source file without target files results in implicitely calling
the builder multiple times (once for each source given). Giving multiple
source files together with target files results in a UserError exception.
<P>

<DT><DD>
The
<I>generator</I>

and
<I>action</I>

arguments must not both be used for the same Builder.
<P>
<DT>source_ext_match<DD>
When the specified
<I>action</I>

argument is a dictionary,
the default behavior when a builder is passed
multiple source files is to make sure that the
extensions of all the source files match.
If it is legal for this builder to be
called with a list of source files with different extensions,
this check can be suppressed by setting
<B>source_ext_match</B>

to
<B>None</B>

or some other non-true value.
When
<B>source_ext_match</B>

is disable,
<B>scons</B>

will use the suffix of the first specified
source file to select the appropriate action from the
<I>action</I>

dictionary.
<P>
In the following example,
the setting of
<B>source_ext_match</B>

prevents
<B>scons</B>

from exiting with an error
due to the mismatched suffixes of
<B>foo.in</B>

and
<B>foo.extra</B>.

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
b = Builder(action={'.in' : 'build $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET'},

env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'MyBuild':b})
env.MyBuild('foo.out', ['foo.in', 'foo.extra'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>env<DD>
A construction environment that can be used
to fetch source code using this Builder.
(Note that this environment is
<I>not</I>

used for normal builds of normal target files,
which use the environment that was
used to call the Builder for the target file.)
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('foo.out', 'foo.in', my_arg = 'xyzzy')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>chdir<DD>
A directory from which scons
will execute the
action(s) specified
for this Builder.
If the
<B>chdir</B>

argument is
a string or a directory Node,
scons will change to the specified directory.
If the
<B>chdir</B>

is not a string or Node
and is non-zero,
then scons will change to the
target file's directory.
<P>
Note that scons will
<I>not</I>

automatically modify
its expansion of
construction variables like
<B>$TARGET</B>

and
<B>$SOURCE</B>

when using the chdir
keyword argument--that is,
the expanded file names
will still be relative to
the top-level SConstruct directory,
and consequently incorrect
relative to the chdir directory.
Builders created using chdir keyword argument,
will need to use construction variable
expansions like
<B>${TARGET.file}</B>

and
<B>${SOURCE.file}</B>

to use just the filename portion of the
targets and source.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
b = Builder(action=&quot;build &lt; ${SOURCE.file} &gt; ${TARGET.file}&quot;,
            chdir=1)
env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<B>WARNING:</B>

Python only keeps one current directory
location for all of the threads.
This means that use of the
<B>chdir</B>

argument
will
<I>not</I>

work with the SCons
<B>-j</B>

option,
because individual worker threads spawned
by SCons interfere with each other
when they start changing directory.
<P>

Any additional keyword arguments supplied
when a Builder object is created
(that is, when the Builder() function is called)
will be set in the executing construction
environment when the Builder object is called.
The canonical example here would be
to set a construction variable to
the repository of a source code system.
<P>
Any additional keyword arguments supplied
when a Builder
<I>object</I>

is called
will only be associated with the target
created by that particular Builder call
(and any other files built as a
result of the call).
<P>
These extra keyword arguments are passed to the
following functions:
command generator functions,
function Actions,
and emitter functions.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Action Objects</H3>

<P>
The
<B>Builder</B>()

function will turn its
<B>action</B>

keyword argument into an appropriate
internal Action object.
You can also explicity create Action objects
using the
<B>Action</B>()

global function,
which can then be passed to the
<B>Builder</B>()

function.
This can be used to configure
an Action object more flexibly,
or it may simply be more efficient
than letting each separate Builder object
create a separate Action
when multiple
Builder objects need to do the same thing.
<P>
The
<B>Action</B>()

global function
returns an appropriate object for the action
represented by the type of the first argument:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Action<DD>
If the first argument is already an Action object,
the object is simply returned.
<P>
<DT>String<DD>
If the first argument is a string,
a command-line Action is returned.
Note that the command-line string
may be preceded by an
<B>@</B>

(at-sign)
to suppress printing of the specified command line,
or by a
<B>-</B>

(hyphen)
to ignore the exit status from the specified command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Action('$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES')

# Doesn't print the line being executed.
Action('@build $TARGET $SOURCES')

# Ignores return value
Action('-build $TARGET $SOURCES')

</PRE>

</DL>










<P>
<DT>List<DD>
If the first argument is a list,
then a list of Action objects is returned.
An Action object is created as necessary
for each element in the list.
If an element
<I>within</I>

the list is itself a list,
the internal list is the
command and arguments to be executed via
the command line.
This allows white space to be enclosed
in an argument by defining
a command in a list within a list:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Action([['cc', '-c', '-DWHITE SPACE', '-o', '$TARGET', '$SOURCES']])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Function<DD>
If the first argument is a Python function,
a function Action is returned.
The Python function must take three keyword arguments,
<B>target</B>

(a Node object representing the target file),
<B>source</B>

(a Node object representing the source file)
and
<B>env</B>

(the construction environment
used for building the target file).
The
<B>target</B>

and
<B>source</B>

arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is
more than one target file or source file.
The actual target and source file name(s) may
be retrieved from their Node objects
via the built-in Python str() function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
target_file_name = str(target)
source_file_names = map(lambda x: str(x), source)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The function should return
<B>0</B>

or
<B>None</B>

to indicate a successful build of the target file(s).
The function may raise an exception
or return a non-zero exit status
to indicate an unsuccessful build.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def build_it(target = None, source = None, env = None):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

a = Action(build_it)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
If the action argument is not one of the above,
None is returned.
</DL>
<P>

<P>
The second argument is optional and is used to define the output
which is printed when the Action is actually performed.
In the absence of this parameter,
or if it's an empty string,
a default output depending on the type of the action is used.
For example, a command-line action will print the executed command.
The argument must be either a Python function or a string.
<P>
In the first case,
it's a function that returns a string to be printed
to describe the action being executed.
The function may also be specified by the
<I>strfunction</I>=

keyword argument.
Like a function to build a file,
this function must take three keyword arguments:
<B>target</B>

(a Node object representing the target file),
<B>source</B>

(a Node object representing the source file)
and
<B>env</B>

(a construction environment).
The
<B>target</B>

and
<B>source</B>

arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is
more than one target file or source file.
<P>
In the second case, you provide the string itself.
The string may also be specified by the
<I>cmdstr</I>=

keyword argument.
The string typically contains variables, notably
$TARGET(S) and $SOURCE(S), or consists of just a single
variable, which is optionally defined somewhere else.
SCons itself heavily uses the latter variant.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

def string_it(target, source, env):
    return &quot;building '%s' from '%s'&quot; % (target[0], source[0])

# Use a positional argument.
f = Action(build_it, string_it)
s = Action(build_it, &quot;building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'&quot;)

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
f = Action(build_it, strfunction=string_it)
s = Action(build_it, cmdstr=&quot;building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'&quot;)

# You can provide a configurable variable.
l = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The third and succeeding arguments, if present,
may either be a construction variable or a list of construction variables
whose values will be included in the signature of the Action
when deciding whether a target should be rebuilt because the action changed.
The variables may also be specified by a
<I>varlist</I>=

keyword parameter;
if both are present, they are combined.
This is necessary whenever you want a target to be rebuilt
when a specific construction variable changes.
This is not often needed for a string action,
as the expanded variables will normally be part of the command line,
but may be needed if a Python function action uses
the value of a construction variable when generating the command line.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the 'XXX' construction variable
    open(target[0], 'w').write(env['XXX'])
    return 0

# Use positional arguments.
a = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT', ['XXX'])

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
a = Action(build_it, varlist=['XXX'])

<P>
The
<B>Action</B>()

global function
can be passed the following
optional keyword arguments
to modify the Action object's behavior:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>chdir</B>

The
<B>chdir</B>

keyword argument specifies that
scons will execute the action
after changing to the specified directory.
If the
<B>chdir</B>

argument is
a string or a directory Node,
scons will change to the specified directory.
If the
<B>chdir</B>

argument
is not a string or Node
and is non-zero,
then scons will change to the
target file's directory.
<P>
Note that scons will
<I>not</I>

automatically modify
its expansion of
construction variables like
<B>$TARGET</B>

and
<B>$SOURCE</B>

when using the chdir
keyword argument--that is,
the expanded file names
will still be relative to
the top-level SConstruct directory,
and consequently incorrect
relative to the chdir directory.
Builders created using chdir keyword argument,
will need to use construction variable
expansions like
<B>${TARGET.file}</B>

and
<B>${SOURCE.file}</B>

to use just the filename portion of the
targets and source.

<B>Action</B>()

global function
also takes an
<B>exitstatfunc</B>

keyword argument
which specifies a function
that is passed the exit status
(or return value)
from the specified action
and can return an arbitrary
or modified value.
This can be used, for example,
to specify that an Action object's
return value should be ignored
under special conditions
and SCons should, therefore,
consider that the action always suceeds:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def always_succeed(s):
    # Always return 0, which indicates success.
    return 0
a = Action(&quot;build &lt; ${SOURCE.file} &gt; ${TARGET.file}&quot;,
           exitstatfunc=always_succeed)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT><DD>
<B>batch_key</B>

The
<B>batch_key</B>

keyword argument can be used
to specify that the Action can create multiple target files
by processing multiple independent source files simultaneously.
(The canonical example is &quot;batch compilation&quot;
of multiple object files
by passing multiple source files
to a single invocation of a compiler
such as Microsoft's Visual C / C++ compiler.)
If the
<B>batch_key</B>

argument is any non-False, non-callable Python value,
the configured Action object will cause
<B>scons</B>

to collect all targets built with the Action object
and configured with the same construction environment
into single invocations of the Action object's
command line or function.
Command lines will typically want to use the
<B>CHANGED_SOURCES</B>

construction variable
(and possibly
<B>CHANGED_TARGETS</B>

as well)
to only pass to the command line those sources that
have actually changed since their targets were built.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=True)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The
<B>batch_key</B>

argument may also be
a callable function
that returns a key that
will be used to identify different
&quot;batches&quot; of target files to be collected
for batch building.
A
<B>batch_key</B>

function must take the following arguments:
<P>
<DT>action<DD>
The action object.
<P>
<DT>env<DD>
The construction environment
configured for the target.
<P>
<DT>target<DD>
The list of targets for a particular configured action.
<P>
<DT>source<DD>
The list of source for a particular configured action.
<P>
The returned key should typically
be a tuple of values derived from the arguments,
using any appropriate logic to decide
how multiple invocations should be batched.
For example, a
<B>batch_key</B>

function may decide to return
the value of a specific construction
variable from the
<B>env</B>

argument
which will cause
<B>scons</B>

to batch-build targets
with matching values of that variable,
or perhaps return the
<B>id</B>()

of the entire construction environment,
in which case
<B>scons</B>

will batch-build
all targets configured with the same construction environment.
Returning
<B>None</B>

indicates that
the particular target should
<I>not</I>

be part of any batched build,
but instead will be built
by a separate invocation of action's
command or function.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def batch_key(action, env, target, source):
    tdir = target[0].dir
    if tdir.name == 'special':
        # Don't batch-build any target
        # in the special/ subdirectory.
        return None
    return (id(action), id(env), tdir)
a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=batch_key)

<H3>Miscellaneous Action Functions</H3>

<P>
<B>scons</B>

supplies a number of functions
that arrange for various common
file and directory manipulations
to be performed.
These are similar in concept to &quot;tasks&quot; in the
Ant build tool,
although the implementation is slightly different.
These functions do not actually
perform the specified action
at the time the function is called,
but instead return an Action object
that can be executed at the
appropriate time.
(In Object-Oriented terminology,
these are actually
Action
<I>Factory</I>

functions
that return Action objects.)
<P>
In practice,
there are two natural ways
that these
Action Functions
are intended to be used.
<P>
First,
if you need
to perform the action
at the time the SConscript
file is being read,
you can use the
<B>Execute</B>

global function to do so:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Touch('file'))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Second,
you can use these functions
to supply Actions in a list
for use by the
<B>Command</B>

method.
This can allow you to
perform more complicated
sequences of file manipulation
without relying
on platform-specific
external commands:
that

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(TMPBUILD = '/tmp/builddir')
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Mkdir('$TMPBUILD'),
             Copy('$TMPBUILD', '${SOURCE.dir}'),
             &quot;cd $TMPBUILD &amp;&amp; make&quot;,
             Delete('$TMPBUILD')])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Chmod(<I>dest</I>, <I>mode</I>)

<DD>
Returns an Action object that
changes the permissions on the specified
<I>dest</I>

file or directory to the specified
<I>mode</I>.

Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Chmod('file', 0755))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'),
             Chmod('$TARGET', 0755)])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Copy(<I>dest</I>, <I>src</I>)

<DD>
Returns an Action object
that will copy the
<I>src</I>

source file or directory to the
<I>dest</I>

destination file or directory.
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Copy('foo.output', 'foo.input'))

env.Command('bar.out', 'bar.in',
            Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Delete(<I>entry</I>, [<I>must_exist</I>])

<DD>
Returns an Action that
deletes the specified
<I>entry</I>,

which may be a file or a directory tree.
If a directory is specified,
the entire directory tree
will be removed.
If the
<I>must_exist</I>

flag is set,
then a Python error will be thrown
if the specified entry does not exist;
the default is
<B>must_exist=0</B>,

that is, the Action will silently do nothing
if the entry does not exist.
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Delete('/tmp/buildroot'))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Delete('${TARGET.dir}'),
             MyBuildAction])

Execute(Delete('file_that_must_exist', must_exist=1))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Mkdir(<I>dir</I>)

<DD>
Returns an Action
that creates the specified
directory
<I>dir .</I>

Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/outputdir'))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Mkdir('/tmp/builddir'),
             Copy('/tmp/builddir/foo.in', '$SOURCE'),
             &quot;cd /tmp/builddir &amp;&amp; make&quot;,
             Copy('$TARGET', '/tmp/builddir/foo.out')])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Move(<I>dest</I>, <I>src</I>)

<DD>
Returns an Action
that moves the specified
<I>src</I>

file or directory to
the specified
<I>dest</I>

file or directory.
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Move('file.destination', 'file.source'))

env.Command('output_file', 'input_file',
            [MyBuildAction,
             Move('$TARGET', 'file_created_by_MyBuildAction')])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Touch(<I>file</I>)

<DD>
Returns an Action
that updates the modification time
on the specified
<I>file</I>.

Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Touch('file_to_be_touched'))

env.Command('marker', 'input_file',
            [MyBuildAction,

<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Variable Substitution</H3>

<P>
Before executing a command,
<B>scons</B>

performs construction variable interpolation on the strings that make up
the command line of builders.
Variables are introduced by a
<B>$</B>

prefix.
Besides construction variables, scons provides the following
variables for each command execution:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>CHANGED_SOURCES<DD>
The file names of all sources of the build command
that have changed since the target was last built.
<P>
<DT>CHANGED_TARGETS<DD>
The file names of all targets that would be built
from sources that have changed since the target was last built.
<P>
<DT>SOURCE<DD>
The file name of the source of the build command,
or the file name of the first source
if multiple sources are being built.
<P>
<DT>SOURCES<DD>
The file names of the sources of the build command.
<P>
<DT>TARGET<DD>
The file name of the target being built,
or the file name of the first target
if multiple targets are being built.
<P>
<DT>TARGETS<DD>
The file names of all targets being built.
<P>
<DT>UNCHANGED_SOURCES<DD>
The file names of all sources of the build command
that have
<I>not</I>

changed since the target was last built.
<P>
<DT>UNCHANGED_TARGETS<DD>
The file names of all targets that would be built
from sources that have
<I>not</I>

changed since the target was last built.
<P>
(Note that the above variables are reserved
and may not be set in a construction environment.)
<P>
</DL>
<P>

For example, given the construction variable CC='cc', targets=['foo'], and
sources=['foo.c', 'bar.c']:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
action='$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
would produce the command line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
cc -c -o foo foo.c bar.c

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Variable names may be surrounded by curly braces ({})
to separate the name from the trailing characters.
Within the curly braces, a variable name may have
a Python slice subscript appended to select one
or more items from a list.
In the previous example, the string:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
${SOURCES[1]}

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
would produce:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
bar.c

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Additionally, a variable name may
have the following special
modifiers appended within the enclosing curly braces
to modify the interpolated string:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>base<DD>
The base path of the file name,
including the directory path
but excluding any suffix.
<P>
<DT>dir<DD>
The name of the directory in which the file exists.
<P>
<DT>file<DD>
The file name,
minus any directory portion.
<P>
<DT>filebase<DD>
Just the basename of the file,
minus any suffix
and minus the directory.
<P>
<DT>suffix<DD>
Just the file suffix.
<P>
<DT>abspath<DD>
The absolute path name of the file.
<P>
<DT>posix<DD>
The POSIX form of the path,
with directories separated by
<B>/</B>

(forward slashes)
not backslashes.
This is sometimes necessary on Windows systems
when a path references a file on other (POSIX) systems.
<P>
<DT>srcpath<DD>
The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file through
<B>VariantDir</B>().

If this file isn't linked,
it just returns the directory and filename unchanged.
<P>
<DT>srcdir<DD>
The directory containing the source file linked to this file through
<B>VariantDir</B>().

If this file isn't linked,
it just returns the directory part of the filename.
<P>
<DT>rsrcpath<DD>
The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file through
<B>VariantDir</B>().

If the file does not exist locally but exists in a Repository,
the path in the Repository is returned.
If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
directory and filename unchanged.
<P>
<DT>rsrcdir<DD>
The Repository directory containing the source file linked to this file through
<B>VariantDir</B>().

If this file isn't linked,
it just returns the directory part of the filename.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

For example, the specified target will
expand as follows for the corresponding modifiers:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$TARGET              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
${TARGET.base}       =&gt; sub/dir/file
${TARGET.dir}        =&gt; sub/dir
${TARGET.file}       =&gt; file.x
${TARGET.filebase}   =&gt; file
${TARGET.suffix}     =&gt; .x
${TARGET.abspath}    =&gt; /top/dir/sub/dir/file.x

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='sub/dir')
$SOURCE              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.srcpath}    =&gt; src/file.x
${SOURCE.srcdir}     =&gt; src

Repository('/usr/repository')
$SOURCE              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcpath}   =&gt; /usr/repository/src/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcdir}    =&gt; /usr/repository/src

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Note that curly braces braces may also be used
to enclose arbitrary Python code to be evaluated.
(In fact, this is how the above modifiers are substituted,
they are simply attributes of the Python objects
that represent TARGET, SOURCES, etc.)
See the section &quot;Python Code Substitution&quot; below,
for more thorough examples of
how this can be used.
<P>
Lastly, a variable name
may be a callable Python function
associated with a
construction variable in the environment.
The function should
take four arguments:
<I>target</I>

- a list of target nodes,
<I>source</I>

- a list of source nodes,
<I>env</I>

- the construction environment,
<I>for_signature</I>

- a Boolean value that specifies
whether the function is being called
for generating a build signature.
SCons will insert whatever
the called function returns
into the expanded string:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return &quot;bar&quot;

# Will expand $BAR to &quot;bar baz&quot;
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR=&quot;$FOO baz&quot;)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
You can use this feature to pass arguments to a
Python function by creating a callable class
that stores one or more arguments in an object,
and then uses them when the
<B>__call__()</B>

method is called.
Note that in this case,
the entire variable expansion must
be enclosed by curly braces
so that the arguments will
be associated with the
instantiation of the class:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
class foo(object):
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
        return self.arg + &quot; bar&quot;

# Will expand $BAR to &quot;my argument bar baz&quot;
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR=&quot;${FOO('my argument')} baz&quot;)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<P>

The special pseudo-variables
<B>$(</B>

and
<B>$)</B>

may be used to surround parts of a command line
that may change
<I>without</I>

causing a rebuild--that is,
which are not included in the signature
of target files built with this command.
All text between
<B>$(</B>

and
<B>$)</B>

will be removed from the command line
before it is added to file signatures,
and the
<B>$(</B>

and
<B>$)</B>

will be removed before the command is executed.
For example, the command line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $). &gt; $TARGET

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<P>

would execute the command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
echo Last build occurred $TODAY. &gt; $TARGET

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<P>

but the command signature added to any target files would be:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
echo Last build occurred  . &gt; $TARGET

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Python Code Substitution</H3>

<P>
Any python code within
<B>${</B>-<B>}</B>

pairs gets evaluated by python 'eval', with the python globals set to
the current environment's set of construction variables.
So in the following case:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env['COND'] = 0
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
   '''echo ${COND==1 and 'FOO' or 'BAR'} &gt; $TARGET''')

</PRE>

</DL>


the command executed will be either

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
echo FOO &gt; foo.out

</PRE>

</DL>


or

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
echo BAR &gt; foo.out

</PRE>

</DL>


according to the current value of env['COND'] when the command is
executed.  The evaluation occurs when the target is being
built, not when the SConscript is being read.  So if env['COND'] is changed
later in the SConscript, the final value will be used.
<P>
Here's a more interesting example.  Note that all of COND, FOO, and
BAR are environment variables, and their values are substituted into
the final command.  FOO is a list, so its elements are interpolated
separated by spaces.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env=Environment()
env['COND'] = 0
env['FOO'] = ['foo1', 'foo2']
env['BAR'] = 'barbar'
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
    'echo ${COND==1 and FOO or BAR} &gt; $TARGET')

# Will execute this:
#  echo foo1 foo2 &gt; foo.out

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
SCons uses the following rules when converting construction variables into
command lines:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>String<DD>
When the value is a string it is interpreted as a space delimited list of
command line arguments.
<P>
<DT>List<DD>
When the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command line
arguments. Each element of the list is converted to a string.
<P>
<DT>Other<DD>
Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string and
interpreted as a single command line argument.
<P>
<DT>Newline<DD>
Newline characters (\n) delimit lines. The newline parsing is done after
all other parsing, so it is not possible for arguments (e.g. file names) to
contain embedded newline characters. This limitation will likely go away in
a future version of SCons.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Scanner Objects</H3>

<P>
You can use the
<B>Scanner</B>

function to define
objects to scan
new file types for implicit dependencies.
The
<B>Scanner</B>

function accepts the following arguments:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>function<DD>
This can be either:
1) a Python function that will process
the Node (file)
and return a list of File Nodes
representing the implicit
dependencies (file names) found in the contents;
or:
2) a dictionary that maps keys
(typically the file suffix, but see below for more discussion)
to other Scanners that should be called.
<P>
If the argument is actually a Python function,
the function must take three or four arguments:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def&nbsp;scanner_function(node,&nbsp;env,&nbsp;path):
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def&nbsp;scanner_function(node,&nbsp;env,&nbsp;path,&nbsp;arg=None):
<P>
The
<B>node</B>

argument is the internal
SCons node representing the file.
Use
<B>str(node)</B>

to fetch the name of the file, and
<B>node.get_contents()</B>

to fetch contents of the file.
Note that the file is
<I>not</I>

guaranteed to exist before the scanner is called,
so the scanner function should check that
if there's any chance that the scanned file
might not exist
(for example, if it's built from other files).
<P>
The
<B>env</B>

argument is the construction environment for the scan.
Fetch values from it using the
<B>env.Dictionary()</B>

method.
<P>
The
<B>path</B>

argument is a tuple (or list)
of directories that can be searched
for files.
This will usually be the tuple returned by the
<B>path_function</B>

argument (see below).
<P>
The
<B>arg</B>

argument is the argument supplied
when the scanner was created, if any.
<P>
<DT>name<DD>
The name of the Scanner.
This is mainly used
to identify the Scanner internally.
<P>
<DT>argument<DD>
An optional argument that, if specified,
will be passed to the scanner function
(described above)
and the path function
(specified below).
<P>
<DT>skeys<DD>
An optional list that can be used to
determine which scanner should be used for
a given Node.
In the usual case of scanning for file names,
this argument will be a list of suffixes
for the different file types that this
Scanner knows how to scan.
If the argument is a string,
then it will be expanded
into a list by the current environment.
<P>
<DT>path_function<DD>
A Python function that takes four or five arguments:
a construction environment,
a Node for the directory containing
the SConscript file in which
the first target was defined,
a list of target nodes,
a list of source nodes,
and an optional argument supplied
when the scanner was created.
The
<B>path_function</B>

returns a tuple of directories
that can be searched for files to be returned
by this Scanner object.
(Note that the
<B>FindPathDirs</B>()

function can be used to return a ready-made
<B>path_function</B>

for a given construction variable name,
instead of having to write your own function from scratch.)
<P>
<DT>node_class<DD>
The class of Node that should be returned
by this Scanner object.
Any strings or other objects returned
by the scanner function
that are not of this class
will be run through the
<B>node_factory</B>

function.
<P>
<DT>node_factory<DD>
A Python function that will take a string
or other object
and turn it into the appropriate class of Node
to be returned by this Scanner object.
<P>
<DT>scan_check<DD>
An optional Python function that takes two arguments,
a Node (file) and a construction environment,
and returns whether the
Node should, in fact,
be scanned for dependencies.
This check can be used to eliminate unnecessary
calls to the scanner function when,
for example, the underlying file
represented by a Node does not yet exist.
<P>
<DT>recursive<DD>
An optional flag that
specifies whether this scanner should be re-invoked
on the dependency files returned by the scanner.
When this flag is not set,
the Node subsystem will
only invoke the scanner on the file being scanned,
and not (for example) also on the files
specified by the #include lines
in the file being scanned.
<I>recursive</I>

may be a callable function,
in which case it will be called with a list of
Nodes found and
should return a list of Nodes
that should be scanned recursively;
this can be used to select a specific subset of
Nodes for additional scanning.
<P>

Note that
<B>scons</B>

has a global
<B>SourceFileScanner</B>

object that is used by
the
<B>Object</B>(),

<B>SharedObject</B>(),

and
<B>StaticObject</B>()

builders to decide
which scanner should be used
for different file extensions.
You can using the
<B>SourceFileScanner.add_scanner</B>()

method to add your own Scanner object
to the
<B>scons</B>

infrastructure
that builds target programs or
libraries from a list of
source files of different types:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def xyz_scan(node, env, path):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    # Scan the contents and return the included files.

XYZScanner = Scanner(xyz_scan)

SourceFileScanner.add_scanner('.xyz', XYZScanner)

env.Program('my_prog', ['file1.c', 'file2.f', 'file3.xyz'])

<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYSTEM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR</H2>

SCons and its configuration files are very portable,
due largely to its implementation in Python.
There are, however, a few portability
issues waiting to trap the unwary.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>.C file suffix</H3>

SCons handles the upper-case
<B>.C</B>

file suffix differently,
depending on the capabilities of
the underlying system.
On a case-sensitive system
such as Linux or UNIX,
SCons treats a file with a

<H3>Windows:  Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs. Windows Pythons</H3>

Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities
that let users work on a
Windows system using a more POSIX-like environment.
The Cygwin tools, including Cygwin Python,
do this, in part,
by sharing an ability to interpret UNIX-like path names.
For example, the Cygwin tools
will internally translate a Cygwin path name
like /cygdrive/c/mydir
to an equivalent Windows pathname
of C:/mydir (equivalent to C:\mydir).
<P>
Versions of Python
that are built for native Windows execution,
such as the python.org and ActiveState versions,
do not have the Cygwin path name semantics.
This means that using a native Windows version of Python
to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools
(such as gcc, bison, and flex)
may yield unpredictable results.
&quot;Mixing and matching&quot; in this way
can be made to work,
but it requires careful attention to the use of path names
in your SConscript files.
<P>
In practice, users can sidestep
the issue by adopting the following rules:
When using gcc,
use the Cygwin-supplied Python interpreter
to run SCons;
when using Microsoft Visual C/C++
(or some other Windows compiler)
use the python.org or ActiveState version of Python
to run SCons.
<A NAME="lbAZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Windows:  scons.bat file</H3>

On Windows systems,
SCons is executed via a wrapper
<B>scons.bat</B>

file.
This has (at least) two ramifications:
<P>
First, Windows command-line users
that want to use variable assignment
on the command line
may have to put double quotes
around the assignments:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons &quot;FOO=BAR&quot; &quot;BAZ=BLEH&quot;

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Second, the Cygwin shell does not
recognize this file as being the same
as an
<B>scons</B>

command issued at the command-line prompt.
You can work around this either by
executing
<B>scons.bat</B>

from the Cygwin command line,
or by creating a wrapper shell
script named
<B>scons .</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbBA">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>MinGW</H3>

<P>
The MinGW bin directory must be in your PATH environment variable or the
PATH variable under the ENV construction variable for SCons
to detect and use the MinGW tools. When running under the native Windows
Python interpreter, SCons will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin
tools, if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin
directories in the PATH variable. If you have both MSVC and MinGW
installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC,
then you must explictly tell SCons to use MinGW by passing
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
tools=['mingw']

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
to the Environment() function, because SCons will prefer the MSVC tools
over the MinGW tools.

<H3>Defining Your Own Builder Object</H3>

<P>
Notice that when you invoke the Builder,
you can leave off the target file suffix,
and SCons will add it automatically.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
bld = Builder(action = 'pdftex &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET'
              suffix = '.pdf',
              src_suffix = '.tex')

env.PDFBuilder(target = 'foo.pdf', source = 'foo.tex')

# The following creates &quot;bar.pdf&quot; from &quot;bar.tex&quot;
env.PDFBuilder(target = 'bar', source = 'bar')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Note also that the above initialization
overwrites the default Builder objects,
so the Environment created above
can not be used call Builders like env.Program(),
env.Object(), env.StaticLibrary(), etc.
<P>
<A NAME="lbBL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Adding Your Own Builder Object to an Environment</H3>

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
bld = Builder(action = 'pdftex &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET'
              suffix = '.pdf',
              src_suffix = '.tex')

<A NAME="lbBM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Defining Your Own Scanner Object</H3>

<P>
The following example shows an extremely simple scanner (the
<B>kfile_scan</B>()

function)
that doesn't use a search path at all
and simply returns the
file names present on any
<B>include</B>

lines in the scanned file.
This would implicitly assume that all included
files live in the top-level directory:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
import re

include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    includes = include_re.findall(contents)
    return env.File(includes)

kscan = Scanner(name = 'kfile',
                function = kfile_scan,
                argument = None,
                skeys = ['.k'])
scanners = Environment().Dictionary('SCANNERS')
env = Environment(SCANNERS = scanners + [kscan])

env.Command('foo', 'foo.k', 'kprocess &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET')

bar_in = File('bar.in')
env.Command('bar', bar_in, 'kprocess $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET')
bar_in.target_scanner = kscan

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
It is important to note that you
have to return a list of File nodes from the scan function, simple
strings for the file names won't do. As in the examples we are showing here,
you can use the
<B>File()</B>

function of your current Environment in order to create nodes on the fly from
a sequence of file names with relative paths.
<P>
Here is a similar but more complete example that searches
a path of directories
(specified as the
<B>MYPATH</B>

construction variable)
for files that actually exist:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
import re
import os
include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    includes = include_re.findall(contents)
    if includes == []:
        return []
    results = []
    for inc in includes:
        for dir in path:
            file = str(dir) + os.sep + inc
            if os.path.exists(file):
                results.append(file)
                break
    return env.File(results)

scanner = Scanner(name = 'myscanner',
                 function = my_scan,
                 argument = None,
                 skeys = ['.x'],
                 path_function = FindPathDirs('MYPATH')
                 )
scanners = Environment().Dictionary('SCANNERS')
env = Environment(SCANNERS = scanners + [scanner],
                  MYPATH = ['incs'])

env.Command('foo', 'foo.x', 'xprocess &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The
<B>FindPathDirs</B>()

function used in the previous example returns a function
(actually a callable Python object)
that will return a list of directories
specified in the
<B>$MYPATH</B>

construction variable. It lets SCons detect the file
<B>incs/foo.inc</B>

, even if 
<B>foo.x </B>

contains the line
<B>include foo.inc </B>

only.
If you need to customize how the search path is derived,
you would provide your own
<B>path_function</B>

argument when creating the Scanner object,
as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# MYPATH is a list of directories to search for files in
def pf(env, dir, target, source, arg):
    top_dir = Dir('#').abspath
    results = []
    if 'MYPATH' in env:
        for p in env['MYPATH']:
            results.append(top_dir + os.sep + p)
    return results

scanner = Scanner(name = 'myscanner',
                 function = my_scan,
                 argument = None,
                 skeys = ['.x'],
                 path_function = pf
                 )

</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="lbBP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Building Multiple Variants From the Same Source</H3>

<P>
Use the variant_dir keyword argument to
the SConscript function to establish
one or more separate variant build directory trees
for a given source directory:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
SConstruct:

    cppdefines = ['FOO']
    Export(&quot;cppdefines&quot;)
    SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='foo')

    cppdefines = ['BAR']
    Export(&quot;cppdefines&quot;)
    SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='bar')

src/SConscript:

    Import(&quot;cppdefines&quot;)
    env = Environment(CPPDEFINES = cppdefines)
    env.Program(target = 'src', source = 'src.c')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Note the use of the Export() method
to set the &quot;cppdefines&quot; variable to a different
value each time we call the SConscript function.
<P>
<A NAME="lbBQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Hierarchical Build of Two Libraries Linked With a Program</H3>

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
SConstruct:

    env = Environment(LIBPATH = ['#libA', '#libB'])
    Export('env')
    SConscript('libA/SConscript')
    SConscript('libB/SConscript')
    SConscript('Main/SConscript')

libA/SConscript:

    Import('env')
    env.Library('a', Split('a1.c a2.c a3.c'))

libB/SConscript:

    Import('env')
    env.Library('b', Split('b1.c b2.c b3.c'))

Main/SConscript:

    Import('env')
    e = env.Copy(LIBS = ['a', 'b'])
    e.Program('foo', Split('m1.c m2.c m3.c'))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The '#' in the LIBPATH directories specify that they're relative to the
top-level directory, so they don't turn into &quot;Main/libA&quot; when they're
used in Main/SConscript.
<P>
Specifying only 'a' and 'b' for the library names
allows SCons to append the appropriate library
prefix and suffix for the current platform
(for example, 'liba.a' on POSIX systems,
'a.lib' on Windows).
<P>

<H3>Using Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled headers</H3>

<P>
Since windows.h includes everything and the kitchen sink, it can take quite
some time to compile it over and over again for a bunch of object files, so
Microsoft provides a mechanism to compile a set of headers once and then
include the previously compiled headers in any object file. This
technology is called precompiled headers. The general recipe is to create a
file named &quot;StdAfx.cpp&quot; that includes a single header named &quot;StdAfx.h&quot;, and
then include every header you want to precompile in &quot;StdAfx.h&quot;, and finally
include &quot;StdAfx.h&quot; as the first header in all the source files you are
compiling to object files. For example:
<P>
StdAfx.h:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/windows.h">windows.h</A>&gt;
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/my_big_header.h">my_big_header.h</A>&gt;

</PRE>
