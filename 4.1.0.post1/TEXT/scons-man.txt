   scons -- a software construction tool

Synopsis

   scons [options...] [name=val...] [targets...]

DESCRIPTION

   scons orchestrates the construction of software (and other tangible
   products such as documentation files) by determining which component
   pieces must be built or rebuilt and invoking the necessary commands to
   build them. SCons offers many features to improve developer
   productivity such as parallel builds, caching of build artifacts, and a
   database of information about previous builds so details do not have to
   be recalculated each run.

   You set up an SCons build system by writing a script that describes
   things to build (targets), and, if necessary, the rules to build those
   files (actions). SCons comes with a collection of Builder methods which
   apply premade rules for building many common software components such
   as executable programs, object files and libraries, so that for many
   software projects, only the targets and input files (sources) need be
   specified in a call to a builder. scons thus can operate at a level of
   abstraction above that of pure files. For example if you specify a
   library target named "foo", scons keeps track of the actual operating
   system dependent filename (for example libfoo.so on a GNU/Linux
   system), and how to refer to that library in later construction steps
   that want to use it, so you don't have to specify that precise
   information yourself. scons can also scan automatically for dependency
   information, such as header files included by source code files, so
   this does not have to be specified manually.

   When invoked, scons looks for a file named SConstruct in the current
   directory and reads the build configuration from that file (other names
   are possible, see [1]the section called "SConscript Files" for more
   information). The SConstruct file may specify subsidiary configuration
   files by calling the [2]SConscript function. By convention, these
   subsidiary files are named SConscript, although any name may be used.
   As a result of this naming convention, the term SConscript files is
   often used to refer generically to the complete set of configuration
   files for a project (including the SConstruct file), regardless of the
   actual file names or number of such files.

   Before reading the SConscript files, scons looks for a directory named
   site_scons in various system directories and in the directory
   containing the SConstruct file or, if specified, the directory from the
   --site-dir option instead, and prepends the ones it finds to the Python
   module search path (sys.path), thus allowing modules in such
   directories to be imported in the normal Python way in SConscript
   files. For each found site directory, (1) if it contains a file
   site_init.py that file is evaluated, and (2) if it contains a directory
   site_tools the path to that directory is prepended to the default
   toolpath. See the --site-dir and --no-site-dir options for details on
   default paths and controlling the site directories.

   SConscript files are written in the Python programming language,
   although it is normally not necessary to be a Python programmer to use
   scons effectively. SConscript files are invoked in a context that makes
   the facilities described in this manual page available in their local
   namespace without any special steps. Standard Python scripting
   capabilities such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported
   Python libraries are available to use to handle complicated build
   situations. Other Python files can be made a part of the build system,
   but they do not automatically have the SCons context and need to import
   it if they need access (described later).

   scons reads and executes all of the included SConscript files before it
   begins building any targets. To make this clear, scons prints the
   following messages about what it is doing:
$ scons foo.out
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets  ...
cp foo.in foo.out
scons: done building targets.
$

   The status messages (lines beginning with the scons: tag) may be
   suppressed using the -Q option.

   scons does not automatically propagate the external environment used to
   execute scons to the commands used to build target files. This is so
   that builds will be guaranteed repeatable regardless of the environment
   variables set at the time scons is invoked. This also means that if the
   compiler or other commands that you want to use to build your target
   files are not in standard system locations, scons will not find them
   unless you explicitly include the locations into the execution
   environment by setting the path in the ENV construction variable in the
   internal construction environment:
import os
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})

   Similarly, if the commands use specific external environment variables
   that scons does not recognize, they can be propagated into the
   execution environment:
import os

env = Environment(
    ENV={
        'PATH': os.environ['PATH'],
        'ANDROID_HOME': os.environ['ANDROID_HOME'],
        'ANDROID_NDK_HOME': os.environ['ANDROID_NDK_HOME'],
    }
)

   Or you may explicitly propagate the invoking user's complete external
   environment:
import os
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ)

   This comes at the expense of making your build dependent on the user's
   environment being set correctly, but it may be more convenient for many
   configurations. It should not cause problems if done in a build setup
   which tightly controls how the environment is set up before invoking
   scons, as in many continuous integration setups.

   scons can scan known input files automatically for dependency
   information (for example, #include preprocessor directives in C or C++
   files) and will rebuild dependent files appropriately whenever any
   "included" input file changes. scons supports the ability to define new
   scanners for unknown input file types.

   scons is normally executed in a top-level directory containing an
   SConstruct file. When scons is invoked, the command line (including the
   contents of the [3]SCONSFLAGS environment variable, if set) is
   processed. Command-line options (see [4]the section called "OPTIONS")
   are consumed. Any variable argument assignments (see [5]the section
   called "Command-Line Construction Variables") are collected, and
   remaining arguments are taken as targets to build.

   Values of variables to be passed to the SConscript files may be
   specified on the command line:
scons debug=1

   These variables are available through the [6]ARGUMENTS dictionary, and
   can be used in the SConscript files to modify the build in any way:
if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')
else:
    env = Environment()

   The command-line variable arguments are also available in the
   [7]ARGLIST list, indexed by their order on the command line. This
   allows you to process them in order rather than by name, if necessary.
   Each ARGLIST entry is a tuple containing (argname, argvalue).

   SCons acts on the selected targets, whether the requested operation is
   build, no-exec or clean. Targets are selected as follows:
    1. Targets specified on the command line. These may be files,
       directories, or phony targets defined using the [8]Alias function.
       Directory targets are scanned by scons for any targets that may be
       found with a destination in or under that directory. The targets
       listed on the command line are made available in the
       [9]COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS list.
    2. If no targets are specified on the command line, scons will select
       those targets specified in the SConscript files via calls to the
       [10]Default function. These are known as the default targets, and
       are made available in the [11]DEFAULT_TARGETS list.
    3. If there are no targets from the previous steps, scons selects the
       current directory for scanning, unless command-line options which
       affect the target scan are detected (-C, -D, -u, -U). Since targets
       thus selected were not the result of user instructions, this target
       list is not made available for direct inspection; use the
       --debug=explain option if they need to be examined.
    4. scons always adds to the selected targets any intermediate targets
       which are necessary to build the specified ones. For example, if
       constructing a shared library or dll from C source files, scons
       will also build the object files which will make up the library.

   To ignore the default targets specified through calls to Default and
   instead build all target files in or below the current directory
   specify the current directory (.) as a command-line target:
scons .

   To build all target files, including any files outside of the current
   directory, supply a command-line target of the root directory (on POSIX
   systems):
scons /

   or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets should be
   built (on Windows systems):
scons C:\ D:\

   A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by remaining at the
   top-level directory (where the SConstruct file lives) and specifying
   the subdirectory as the target to build:
scons src/subdir

   or by changing directory and invoking scons with the -u option, which
   traverses up the directory hierarchy until it finds the SConstruct
   file, and then builds targets relatively to the current subdirectory
   (see also the related -D and -U options):
cd src/subdir
scons -u .

   In all cases, more files may be built than are requested, as scons
   needs to make sure any dependent files are built.

   Specifying "cleanup" targets in SConscript files is usually not
   necessary. The -c flag removes all selected targets:
scons -c .

   to remove all target files in or under the current directory, or:
scons -c build export

   to remove target files under build and export.

   Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
   [12]Clean function in the SConscript files. Conversely, targets that
   would normally be removed by the -c invocation can be retained by
   calling the [13]NoClean function with those targets.

   scons supports building multiple targets in parallel via a -j option
   that takes, as its argument, the number of simultaneous tasks that may
   be spawned:
scons -j 4

   builds four targets in parallel, for example.

   scons can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can be shared
   between multiple builds. When derived-file caching is enabled in an
   SConscript file, any target files built by scons will be copied to the
   cache. If an up-to-date target file is found in the cache, it will be
   retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally. Caching
   behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
   --cache-force, --cache-disable, --cache-readonly, and --cache-show
   command-line options. The --random option is useful to prevent multiple
   builds from trying to update the cache simultaneously.

   By default, scons searches for known programming tools on various
   systems and initializes itself based on what is found. On Windows
   systems which identify as win32, scons searches in order for the
   Microsoft Visual C++ tools, the MinGW tool chain, the Intel compiler
   tools, and the PharLap ETS compiler. On Windows system which identify
   as cygwin (that is, if scons is invoked from a cygwin shell), the order
   changes to prefer the GCC toolchain over the MSVC tools. On OS/2
   systems, scons searches in order for the OS/2 compiler, the GCC tool
   chain, and the Microsoft Visual C++ tools, On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX,
   Hewlett Packard HP-UX, and Oracle Solaris systems, scons searches for
   the native compiler tools (MIPSpro, Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools
   respectively) and the GCC tool chain. On all other platforms, including
   POSIX (Linux and UNIX) platforms, scons searches in order for the GCC
   tool chain, and the Intel compiler tools. These default values may be
   overridden by appropriate setting of construction variables.

   scons requires Python 3.5 or higher. There should be no other
   dependencies or requirements to run scons.

OPTIONS

   In general, scons supports the same command-line options as GNU Make
   and many of those supported by cons.

   -b
          Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of Make

   -c, --clean, --remove
          Clean up by removing the selected targets, well as any files or
          directories associated with a selected target through calls to
          the [14]Clean function. Will not remove any targets which are
          marked for preservation through calls to the [15]NoClean
          function.

   --cache-debug=file
          Write debug information about derived-file caching to the
          specified file. If file is a hyphen (-), the debug information
          is printed to the standard output. The printed messages describe
          what signature-file names are being looked for in, retrieved
          from, or written to the derived-file cache specified by
          [16]CacheDir.

   --cache-disable, --no-cache
          Disable derived-file caching. scons will neither retrieve files
          from the cache nor copy files to the cache. This option can be
          used to temporarily disable the cache without modifying the
          build scripts.

   --cache-force, --cache-populate
          When using [17]CacheDir, populate a derived-file cache by
          copying any already-existing, up-to-date derived files to the
          cache, in addition to files built by this invocation. This is
          useful to populate a new cache with all the current derived
          files, or to add to the cache any derived files recently built
          with caching disabled via the --cache-disable option.

   --cache-readonly
          Use the derived-file cache, if enabled, to retrieve files, but
          do not not update the cache with any files actually built during
          this invocation.

   --cache-show
          When using a derived-file cache and retrieving a file from it,
          show the command that would have been executed to build the
          file. Without this option, scons reports "Retrieved `file' from
          cache.". This allows producing consistent output for build logs,
          regardless of whether a target file was rebuilt or retrieved
          from the cache.

   --config=mode
          Control how the Configure call should use or generate the
          results of configuration tests. modeshould be specified from
          among the following choices:

        auto
                scons will use its normal dependency mechanisms to decide
                if a test must be rebuilt or not. This saves time by not
                running the same configuration tests every time you invoke
                scons, but will overlook changes in system header files or
                external commands (such as compilers) if you don't specify
                those dependecies explicitly. This is the default
                behavior.

        force
                If this option is specified, all configuration tests will
                be re-run regardless of whether the cached results are out
                of date. This can be used to explicitly force the
                configuration tests to be updated in response to an
                otherwise unconfigured change in a system header file or
                compiler.

        cache
                If this option is specified, no configuration tests will
                be rerun and all results will be taken from cache. scons
                will report an error if --config=cache is specified and a
                necessary test does not have any results in the cache.

   -C directory, --directory=directory
          Run as if scons was started in directory instead of the current
          working directory. That is, change directory before searching
          for the SConstruct, Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py,
          Sconstruct.py or sconstruct.py file or doing anything else. When
          multiple -C options are given, each subsequent non-absolute -C
          directory is interpreted relative to the preceding one. This
          option is similar to using -f directory/SConstruct, but -f does
          not search for any of the predefined SConstruct names in the
          specified directory. See also options -u, -U and -D to change
          the SConstruct search behavior when this option is used.

   -D
          Works exactly the same way as the -u option except for the way
          default targets are handled. When this option is used and no
          targets are specified on the command line, all default targets
          are built, whether or not they are below the current directory.

   --debug=type[,type...]
          Debug the build process. type specifies the kind of debugging
          info to emit. Multiple types may be specified, separated by
          commas. The following entries show the recognized types:

        action-timestamps
                Prints additional time profiling information. For each
                command, shows the absolute start and end times. This may
                be useful in debugging parallel builds. Implies the
                --debug=time option.

                Available since scons 3.1.

        count
                Print how many objects are created of the various classes
                used internally by SCons before and after reading the
                SConscript files and before and after building targets.
                This is not supported when SCons is executed with the
                Python -O (optimized) option or when the SCons modules
                have been compiled with optimization (that is, when
                executing from *.pyo files).

        duplicate
                Print a line for each unlink/relink (or copy) of a variant
                file from its source file. Includes debugging info for
                unlinking stale variant files, as well as unlinking old
                targets before building them.

        explain
                Print an explanation of why scons is deciding to
                (re-)build the targets it selects for building.

        findlibs
                Instruct the scanner that searches for libraries to print
                a message about each potential library name it is
                searching for, and about the actual libraries it finds.

        includes
                Print the include tree after each top-level target is
                built. This is generally used to find out what files are
                included by the sources of a given derived file:

$ scons --debug=includes foo.o

        memoizer
                Prints a summary of hits and misses using the Memoizer, an
                internal subsystem that counts how often SCons uses cached
                values in memory instead of recomputing them each time
                they're needed.

        memory
                Prints how much memory SCons uses before and after reading
                the SConscript files and before and after building
                targets.

        objects
                Prints a list of the various objects of the various
                classes used internally by SCons.

        pdb
                Re-run scons under the control of the pdb Python debugger.

        prepare
                Print a line each time any target (internal or external)
                is prepared for building. scons prints this for each
                target it considers, even if that target is up to date
                (see also --debug=explain). This can help debug problems
                with targets that aren't being built; it shows whether
                scons is at least considering them or not.

        presub
                Print the raw command line used to build each target
                before the construction environment variables are
                substituted. Also shows which targets are being built by
                this command. Output looks something like this:

$ scons --debug=presub
Building myprog.o with action(s):
  $SHCC $SHCFLAGS $SHCCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES
...

        stacktrace
                Prints an internal Python stack trace when encountering an
                otherwise unexplained error.

        time
                Prints various time profiling information:

               o The time spent executing each individual build command
               o The total build time (time SCons ran from beginning to
                 end)
               o The total time spent reading and executing SConscript
                 files
               o The total time SCons itself spent running (that is, not
                 counting reading and executing SConscript files)
               o The total time spent executing all build commands
               o The elapsed wall-clock time spent executing those build
                 commands
               o The time spent processing each file passed to the
                 SConscript function

                (When scons is executed without the -j option, the elapsed
                wall-clock time will typically be slightly longer than the
                total time spent executing all the build commands, due to
                the SCons processing that takes place in between executing
                each command. When scons is executed with the -j option,
                and your build configuration allows good parallelization,
                the elapsed wall-clock time should be significantly
                smaller than the total time spent executing all the build
                commands, since multiple build commands and intervening
                SCons processing should take place in parallel.)

   --diskcheck=type[,type...]
          Enable specific checks for whether or not there is a file on
          disk where the SCons configuration expects a directory (or vice
          versa), and whether or not RCS or SCCS sources exist when
          searching for source and include files. The type argument can be
          set to:

        all
                Enable all checks explicitly (the default behavior).

        none
                Disable all such checks.

        match
                to check that files and directories on disk match SCons'
                expected configuration.

        rcs
                Check for the existence of an RCS source for any missing
                source or include files.

        sccs
                Check for the existence of an SCCS source for any missing
                source or include files.

          Multiple checks can be specified separated by commas. for
          example, --diskcheck=sccs,rcs would still check for SCCS and RCS
          sources, but disable the check for on-disk matches of files and
          directories. Disabling some or all of these checks can provide a
          performance boost for large configurations, or when the
          configuration will check for files and/or directories across
          networked or shared file systems, at the slight increased risk
          of an incorrect build or of not handling errors gracefully (if
          include files really should be found in SCCS or RCS, for
          example, or if a file really does exist where the SCons
          configuration expects a directory).

   --duplicate=ORDER
          There are three ways to duplicate files in a build tree: hard
          links, soft (symbolic) links and copies. The default behaviour
          of SCons is to prefer hard links to soft links to copies. You
          can specify different behaviours with this option. ORDER must be
          one of hard-soft-copy (the default), soft-hard-copy, hard-copy,
          soft-copy or copy. SCons will attempt to duplicate files using
          the mechanisms in the specified order.

   --enable-virtualenv
          Import virtualenv-related variables to SCons.

   -f file, --file=file, --makefile=file, --sconstruct=file
          Use file as the initial SConscript file. Multiple -f options may
          be specified, in which case scons will read all of the specified
          files.

   -h, --help
          Print a local help message for this project, if one is defined
          in the SConscript files (see the [18]Help function), plus a line
          that refers to the standard SCons help message. If no local help
          message is defined, prints the standard SCons help message (as
          for the -H option) plus help for any local options defined
          through [19]AddOption. Exits after displaying the appropriate
          message.

          Note that use of this option requires SCons to process the
          SConscript files, so syntax errors may cause the help message
          not to be displayed.

   -H, --help-options
          Print the standard help message about SCons command-line options
          and exit.

   -i, --ignore-errors
          Ignore all errors from commands executed to rebuild files.

   -I directory, --include-dir=directory
          Specifies a directory to search for imported Python modules. If
          several -I options are used, the directories are searched in the
          order specified.

   --ignore-virtualenv
          Suppress importing virtualenv-related variables to SCons.

   --implicit-cache
          Cache implicit dependencies. This causes scons to use the
          implicit (scanned) dependencies from the last time it was run
          instead of scanning the files for implicit dependencies. This
          can significantly speed up SCons, but with the following
          limitations:

          scons will not detect changes to implicit dependency search
          paths (e.g. CPPPATH, LIBPATH) that would ordinarily cause
          different versions of same-named files to be used.

          scons will miss changes in the implicit dependencies in cases
          where a new implicit dependency is added earlier in the implicit
          dependency search path (e.g. CPPPATH, LIBPATH) than a current
          implicit dependency with the same name.

   --implicit-deps-changed
          Forces SCons to ignore the cached implicit dependencies. This
          causes the implicit dependencies to be rescanned and recached.
          This implies --implicit-cache.

   --implicit-deps-unchanged
          Force SCons to ignore changes in the implicit dependencies. This
          causes cached implicit dependencies to always be used. This
          implies --implicit-cache.

   --install-sandbox=sandbox_path
          When using the Install builders, prepend sandbox_path to the
          installation paths such that all installed files will be placed
          under that directory. This option is unavailable if one of
          [20]Install, [21]InstallAs or [22]InstallVersionedLib is not
          used in the SConscript files.

   --interactive
          Starts SCons in interactive mode. The SConscript files are read
          once and a scons>>> prompt is printed. Targets may now be
          rebuilt by typing commands at interactive prompt without having
          to re-read the SConscript files and re-initialize the dependency
          graph from scratch.

          SCons interactive mode supports the following commands:

        build [OPTIONS] [TARGETS] ...
                Builds the specified TARGETS (and their dependencies) with
                the specified SCons command-line OPTIONS. b and scons are
                synonyms for build.

                The following SCons command-line options affect the build
                command:

--cache-debug=FILE
--cache-disable, --no-cache
--cache-force, --cache-populate
--cache-readonly
--cache-show
--debug=TYPE
-i, --ignore-errors
-j N, --jobs=N
-k, --keep-going
-n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
-Q
-s, --silent, --quiet
--taskmastertrace=FILE
--tree=OPTIONS

                Any other SCons command-line options that are specified do
                not cause errors but have no effect on the build command
                (mainly because they affect how the SConscript files are
                read, which only happens once at the beginning of
                interactive mode).

        clean [OPTIONS] [TARGETS] ...
                Cleans the specified TARGETS (and their dependencies) with
                the specified OPTIONS. c is a synonym. This command is
                itself a synonym for build --clean

        exit
                Exits SCons interactive mode. You can also exit by
                terminating input (Ctrl+D UNIX or Linux systems, (Ctrl+Z
                on Windows systems).

        help [COMMAND]
                Provides a help message about the commands available in
                SCons interactive mode. If COMMAND is specified, h and ?
                are synonyms.

        shell [COMMANDLINE]
                Executes the specified COMMANDLINE in a subshell. If no
                COMMANDLINE is specified, executes the interactive command
                interpreter specified in the SHELL environment variable
                (on UNIX and Linux systems) or the COMSPEC environment
                variable (on Windows systems). sh and ! are synonyms.

        version
                Prints SCons version information.

          An empty line repeats the last typed command. Command-line
          editing can be used if the readline module is available.

$ scons --interactive
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons>>> build -n prog
scons>>> exit

   -j N, --jobs=N
          Specifies the maximum number of comcurrent jobs (commands) to
          run. If there is more than one -j option, the last one is
          effective.

   -k, --keep-going
          Continue as much as possible after an error. The target that
          failed and those that depend on it will not be remade, but other
          targets specified on the command line will still be processed.

   -m
          Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of Make.

   --max-drift=SECONDS
          Set the maximum expected drift in the modification time of files
          to SECONDS. This value determines how long a file must be
          unmodified before its cached content signature will be used
          instead of calculating a new content signature (MD5 checksum) of
          the file's contents. The default value is 2 days, which means a
          file must have a modification time of at least two days ago in
          order to have its cached content signature used. A negative
          value means to never cache the content signature and to ignore
          the cached value if there already is one. A value of 0 means to
          always use the cached signature, no matter how old the file is.

   --md5-chunksize=KILOBYTES
          Set the block size used to compute MD5 signatures to KILOBYTES.
          This value determines the size of the chunks which are read in
          at once when computing MD5 signatures. Files below that size are
          fully stored in memory before performing the signature
          computation while bigger files are read in block-by-block. A
          huge block-size leads to high memory consumption while a very
          small block-size slows down the build considerably.

          The default value is to use a chunk size of 64 kilobytes, which
          should be appropriate for most uses.

   -n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
          No execute. Print the commands that would be executed to build
          any out-of-date target files, but do not execute the commands.

   --no-site-dir
          Prevents the automatic addition of the standard site_scons dirs
          to sys.path. Also prevents loading the site_scons/site_init.py
          modules if they exist, and prevents adding their
          site_scons/site_tools dirs to the toolpath.

   --package-type=type
          The type or types of package to create when using the
          [23]Package builder. In the case of multiple types, type should
          be a comma-separated string; SCons will try to build for all of
          those packages. Note this option is only available if the
          [24]packaging tool has been enabled.

   --profile=file
          Run SCons under the Python profiler and save the results in the
          specified file. The results may be analyzed using the Python
          pstats module.

   -q, --question
          Do not run any commands, or print anything. Just return an exit
          status that is zero if the specified targets are already up to
          date, non-zero otherwise.

   -Q
          Quiets SCons status messages about reading SConscript files,
          building targets and entering directories. Commands that are
          executed to rebuild target files are still printed.

   --random
          Build dependencies in a random order. This is useful when
          building multiple trees simultaneously with caching enabled, to
          prevent multiple builds from simultaneously trying to build or
          retrieve the same target files.

   -s, --silent, --quiet
          Silent. Do not print commands that are executed to rebuild
          target files. Also suppresses SCons status messages.

   -S, --no-keep-going, --stop
          Ignored for compatibility with GNU Make

   --site-dir=dir
          Uses the named dir as the site directory rather than the default
          site_scons directories. This directory will be prepended to
          sys.path, the module dir/site_init.py will be loaded if it
          exists, and dir/site_tools will be added to the default
          toolpath.

          The default set of site_scons directories used when --site-dir
          is not specified depends on the system platform, as follows.
          Directories are examined in the order given, from most generic
          to most specific, so the last-executed site_init.py file is the
          most specific one (which gives it the chance to override
          everything else), and the directories are prepended to the
          paths, again so the last directory examined comes first in the
          resulting path.

   --stack-size=KILOBYTES
          Set the size stack used to run threads to KILOBYTES. This value
          determines the stack size of the threads used to run jobs. These
          threads execute the actions of the builders for the nodes that
          are out-of-date. This option has no effect unless the number of
          concurrent build jobs is larger than one (as set by -j N or
          --jobs=N on the command line or SetOption in a script).

          Using a stack size that is too small may cause stack overflow
          errors. This usually shows up as segmentation faults that cause
          scons to abort before building anything. Using a stack size that
          is too large will cause scons to use more memory than required
          and may slow down the entire build process. The default value is
          to use a stack size of 256 kilobytes, which should be
          appropriate for most uses. You should not need to increase this
          value unless you encounter stack overflow errors.

   -t, --touch
          Ignored for compatibility with GNU Make. (Touching a file to
          make it appear up-to-date is unnecessary when using scons.)

   --taskmastertrace=file
          Prints trace information to the specified file about how the
          internal Taskmaster object evaluates and controls the order in
          which Nodes are built. A file name of - may be used to specify
          the standard output.

   --tree=type[,type...]
          Prints a tree of the dependencies after each top-level target is
          built. This prints out some or all of the tree, in various
          formats, depending on the type specified:

        all
                Print the entire dependency tree after each top-level
                target is built. This prints out the complete dependency
                tree, including implicit dependencies and ignored
                dependencies.

        derived
                Restricts the tree output to only derived (target) files,
                not source files.

        linedraw
                Draw the tree output using Unicode line-drawing characters
                instead of plain ASCII text. This option acts as a
                modifier to the selected type(s). If specified alone,
                without any type, it behaves as if all had been specified.

                Available since scons 4.0.

        status
                Prints status information for each displayed node.

        prune
                Prunes the tree to avoid repeating dependency information
                for nodes that have already been displayed. Any node that
                has already been displayed will have its name printed in
                [square brackets], as an indication that the dependencies
                for that node can be found by searching for the relevant
                output higher up in the tree.

          Multiple type choices may be specified, separated by commas:

# Prints only derived files, with status information:
scons --tree=derived,status

# Prints all dependencies of target, with status information
# and pruning dependencies of already-visited Nodes:
scons --tree=all,prune,status target

   -u, --up, --search-up
          Walks up the directory structure until an SConstruct,
          Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py, Sconstruct.py or
          sconstruct.py file is found, and uses that as the top of the
          directory tree. If no targets are specified on the command line,
          only targets at or below the current directory will be built.

   -U
          Works exactly the same way as the -u option except for the way
          default targets are handled. When this option is used and no
          targets are specified on the command line, all default targets
          that are defined in the SConscript(s) in the current directory
          are built, regardless of what directory the resultant targets
          end up in.

   -v, --version
          Print the scons version, copyright information, list of authors,
          and any other relevant information. Then exit.

   -w, --print-directory
          Print a message containing the working directory before and
          after other processing.

   --no-print-directory
          Turn off -w, even if it was turned on implicitly.

   --warn=type, --warn=no-type
          Enable or disable (with the no- prefix) warnings. type specifies
          the type of warnings to be enabled or disabled:

        all
                All warnings.

        cache-version
                Warnings about the derived-file cache directory specified
                by [25]CacheDir not using the latest configuration
                information. These warnings are enabled by default.

        cache-write-error
                Warnings about errors trying to write a copy of a built
                file to a specified derived-file cache specified by
                [26]CacheDir. These warnings are disabled by default.

        corrupt-sconsign
                Warnings about unfamiliar signature data in .sconsign
                files. These warnings are enabled by default.

        dependency
                Warnings about dependencies. These warnings are disabled
                by default.

        deprecated
                Warnings about use of currently deprecated features. These
                warnings are enabled by default. Not all deprecation
                warnings can be disabled with the --warn=no-deprecated
                option as some deprecated features which are late in the
                deprecation cycle may have been designated as mandatory
                warnings, and these will still display. Warnings for
                certain deprecated features may also be enabled or
                disabled individually; see below.

        duplicate-environment
                Warnings about attempts to specify a build of a target
                with two different construction environments that use the
                same action. These warnings are enabled by default.

        fortran-cxx-mix
                Warnings about linking Fortran and C++ object files in a
                single executable, which can yield unpredictable behavior
                with some compilers.

        future-deprecated
                Warnings about features that will be deprecated in the
                future. Such warnings are disabled by default. Enabling
                future deprecation warnings is recommended for projects
                that redistribute SCons configurations for other users to
                build, so that the project can be warned as soon as
                possible about to-be-deprecated features that may require
                changes to the configuration.

        link
                Warnings about link steps.

        misleading-keywords
                Warnings about the use of two commonly misspelled keywords
                targets and sources to [27]Builder calls. The correct
                spelling is the singular form, even though target and
                source can themselves refer to lists of names or nodes.

        missing-sconscript
                Warnings about missing SConscript files. These warnings
                are enabled by default.

        no-object-count
                Warnings about the --debug=object feature not working when
                scons is run with the Python -O option or from optimized
                Python (.pyo) modules.

        no-parallel-support
                Warnings about the version of Python not being able to
                support parallel builds when the -j option is used. These
                warnings are enabled by default.

        python-version
                Warnings about running SCons with a deprecated version of
                Python. These warnings are enabled by default.

        reserved-variable
                Warnings about attempts to set the reserved construction
                variable names $CHANGED_SOURCES, $CHANGED_TARGETS,
                $TARGET, $TARGETS, $SOURCE, $SOURCES, $UNCHANGED_SOURCES
                or $UNCHANGED_TARGETS. These warnings are disabled by
                default.

        stack-size
                Warnings about requests to set the stack size that could
                not be honored. These warnings are enabled by default.

        target_not_build
                Warnings about a build rule not building the expected
                targets. These warnings are disabled by default.

   -Y repository, --repository=repository, --srcdir=repository
          Search the specified repository for any input and target files
          not found in the local directory hierarchy. Multiple -Y options
          may be specified, in which case the repositories are searched in
          the order specified.

SCONSCRIPT FILE REFERENCE

SConscript Files

   The build configuration is described by one or more files, known as
   SConscript files. There must be at least one file for a valid build
   (scons will quit if it does not find one). scons by default looks for
   this file by the name SConstruct in the directory from which you run
   scons, though if necessary, also looks for alternative file names
   Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py, Sconstruct.py and sconstruct.py
   in that order. A different file name (which can include a pathname
   part) may be specified via the -f option. Except for the SConstruct
   file, these files are not searched for automatically; you add
   additional configuration files to the build by calling the
   [28]SConscript function. This allows parts of the build to be
   conditionally included or excluded at run-time depending on how scons
   is invoked.

   Each SConscript file in a build configuration is invoked independently
   in a separate context. This provides necessary isolation so that
   different parts of the build don't accidentally step on each other. You
   have to be explicit about sharing information, by using the [29]Export
   function or the exports argument to the SConscript function, as well as
   the [30]Return function in a called SConscript file, and comsume shared
   information by using the [31]Import function.

   The following sections describe the various SCons facilities that can
   be used in SConscript files. Quick links:
   [32]Construction Environments
   [33]Tools
   [34]Builder Methods
   [35]Methods and Functions to do Things
   [36]SConscript Variables
   [37]Construction Variables
   [38]Configure Contexts
   [39]Command-Line Construction Variables
   [40]Node Objects

Construction Environments

   A Construction Environment is the basic means by which SConscript files
   communicate build information to scons. A new construction environment
   is created using the [41]Environment function:
env = Environment()

   Construction environment attributes called Construction Variables may
   be set either by specifying them as keyword arguments when the object
   is created or by assigning them a value after the object is created.
   These two are nominally equivalent:
env = Environment(FOO='foo')
env['FOO'] = 'foo'

   Note that certain settings which affect tool detection are referenced
   only during initialization, and so need to be supplied as part of the
   call to Environment. For example, setting [42]$MSVC_VERSION selects the
   version of Microsoft Visual C++ you wish to use, but setting it after
   the construction environment is constructed has no effect.

   As a convenience, construction variables may also be set or modified by
   the parse_flags keyword argument during object creation, which has the
   effect of the [43]env.MergeFlags method being applied to the argument
   value after all other processing is completed. This is useful either if
   the exact content of the flags is unknown (for example, read from a
   control file) or if the flags need to be distributed to a number of
   construction variables. [44]env.ParseFlags describes how these
   arguments are distributed to construction variables.
env = Environment(parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

   This example adds 'include' to the CPPPATH construction variable,
   'EBUG' to CPPDEFINES, and 'm' to LIBS.

   An existing construction environment can be duplicated by calling the
   [45]env.Clone method. Without arguments, it will be a copy with the
   same settings. Otherwise, env.Clone takes the same arguments as
   Environment, and uses the arguments to create a modified copy.

   SCons provides a special construction environment called the Default
   Environment. The default environment is used only for global functions,
   that is, construction activities called without the context of a
   regular construction environment. See [46]DefaultEnvironment for more
   information.

   By default, a new construction environment is initialized with a set of
   builder methods and construction variables that are appropriate for the
   current platform. The optional platform keyword argument may be used to
   specify that the construction environment should be initialized for a
   different platform:
env = Environment(platform='cygwin')
env = Environment(platform='os2')
env = Environment(platform='posix')
env = Environment(platform='win32')

   Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate construction
   variables in the environment to use and generate file names with
   prefixes and suffixes appropriate for that platform.

   Note that the win32 platform adds the SystemDrive and SystemRoot
   variables from the user's external environment to the construction
   environment's ENV dictionary. This is so that any executed commands
   that use sockets to connect with other systems (such as fetching source
   files from external CVS repository specifications like
   :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/scons) will work on
   Windows systems.

   The platform argument may be a function or callable object, in which
   case the Environment method will call it to update the new construction
   environment:
def my_platform(env):
    env['VAR'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(platform=my_platform)

   The optional tools and toolpath keyword arguments affect the way tools
   available to the environment are initialized. See [47]the section
   called "Tools" for details.

   The optional variables keyword argument allows passing a Variables
   object which will be used in the initialization of the construction
   environment See [48]the section called "Command-Line Construction
   Variables" for details.

Tools

   SCons has a large number of predefined tools (more properly, tool
   specifications) which are used to help initialize the construction
   environment. An scons tool is only responsible for setup. For example,
   if the SConscript file declares the need to construct an object file
   from a C-language source file by calling the [49]Object builder, then a
   tool representing an available C compiler needs to have run first, to
   set up the builder and all the construction variables it needs in the
   associated construction environment; the tool itself is not called in
   the process of the build. Normally this happens invisibly: scons has
   per-platform lists of default tools, and it runs through those tools,
   calling the ones which are actually applicable, skipping those where
   necessary programs are not installed on the build system, or other
   preconditions are not met.

   A specific set of tools with which to initialize an environment when
   creating it may be specified using the optional keyword argument tools,
   which takes a list of tool names. This is useful to override the
   defaults, to specify non-default built-in tools, and to supply added
   tools:
env = Environment(tools=['msvc', 'lex'])

   Tools can also be directly called by using the [50]Tool method (see
   below).

   The tools argument overrides the default tool list, it does not add to
   it, so be sure to include all the tools you need. For example if you
   are building a c/c++ program you must specify a tool for at least a
   compiler and a linker, as in tools=['clang', 'link']. The tool name
   'default' can be used to retain the default list.

   If no tools argument is specified, or if tools includes 'default', then
   scons will auto-detect usable tools, using the execution environment
   value of PATH (that is, env['ENV']['PATH'] - the external evironment
   PATH from os.environ is not used) for looking up any backing programs,
   and the platform name in effect to determine the default tools for that
   platform. Changing the PATH variable after the construction environment
   is constructed will not cause the tools to be re-detected.

   Additional tools can be added to a project either by placing them in a
   site_tools subdirectory of a site directory, or in a custom location
   specified to scons by giving the toolpath keyword argument. toolpath
   also takes a list as its value:
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'foo'], toolpath=['tools'])

   This looks for a tool specification module foo.py in directory tools
   and in the standard locations, as well as using the ordinary default
   tools for the platform.

   Directories specified via toolpath are prepended to the existing tool
   path. The default tool path is any site_tools directories, so tools in
   a specified toolpath take priority, followed by tools in a site_tools
   directory, followed by built-in tools. For example, adding a tool
   specification module gcc.py to the toolpath directory would override
   the built-in [51]gcc tool. The tool path is stored in the environment
   and will be used by subsequent calls to the [52]Tool method, as well as
   by [53]env.Clone.
base = Environment(toolpath=['custom_path'])
derived = base.Clone(tools=['custom_tool'])
derived.CustomBuilder()

   A tool specification module must include two functions:

   generate(env, **kwargs)
          Modifies the environment referenced by env to set up variables
          so that the facilities represented by the tool can be executed.
          It may use any keyword arguments that the user supplies in
          kwargs to vary its initialization.

   exists(env)
          Return True if the tool can be called in the context of env.
          Usually this means looking up one or more known programs using
          the PATH from the supplied env, but the tool can make the
          "exists" decision in any way it chooses.

Note

   At the moment, user-added tools do not automatically have their exists
   function called. As a result, it is recommended that the generate
   function be defensively coded - that is, do not rely on any necessary
   existence checks already having been performed. This is expected to be
   a temporary limitation, and the exists function should still be
   provided.

   The elements of the tools list may also be functions or callable
   objects, in which case the Environment method will call those objects
   to update the new construction environment (see [54]Tool for more
   details):
def my_tool(env):
    env['XYZZY'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(tools=[my_tool])

   The individual elements of the tools list may also themselves be lists
   or tuples of the form (toolname, kw_dict). SCons searches for the
   toolname specification file as described above, and passes kw_dict,
   which must be a dictionary, as keyword arguments to the tool's generate
   function. The generate function can use the arguments to modify the
   tool's behavior by setting up the environment in different ways or
   otherwise changing its initialization.
# in tools/my_tool.py:
def generate(env, **kwargs):
  # Sets MY_TOOL to the value of keyword 'arg1' '1' if not supplied
  env['MY_TOOL'] = kwargs.get('arg1', '1')

def exists(env):
  return True

# in SConstruct:
env = Environment(tools=['default', ('my_tool', {'arg1': 'abc'})],
                  toolpath=['tools'])

   The tool specification (my_tool in the example) can use the PLATFORM
   variable from the construction environment it is passed to customize
   the tool for different platforms.

   Tools can be "nested" - that is, they can be located within a
   subdirectory in the toolpath. A nested tool name uses a dot to
   represent a directory separator
# namespaced builder
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ, tools=['SubDir1.SubDir2.SomeTool'])
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

# Search Paths
# SCons\Tool\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool.py
# SCons\Tool\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool\__init__.py
# .\site_scons\site_tools\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool.py
# .\site_scons\site_tools\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool\__init__.py

   default
          Sets construction variables for a default list of Tool modules.
          Use default in the tools list to retain the original defaults,
          since the tools parameter is treated as a literal statement of
          the tools to be made available in that construction environment,
          not an addition.

          The list of tools selected by default is not static, but is
          dependent both on the platform and on the software installed on
          the platform. Some tools will not initialize if an underlying
          command is not found, and some tools are selected from a list of
          choices on a first-found basis. The finished tool list can be
          examined by inspecting the TOOLS construction variable in the
          construction environment.

          On all platforms, all tools from the following list are selected
          whose respective conditions are met: filesystem, wix, lex, yacc,
          rpcgen, swig, jar, javac, javah, rmic, dvipdf, dvips, gs, tex,
          latex, pdflatex, pdftex, tar, zip, textfile.

          On Linux systems, the default tools list selects (first-found):
          a C compiler from gcc, intelc, icc, cc; a C++ compiler from g++,
          intelc, icc, cxx; an assembler from gas, nasm, masm; a linker
          from gnulink, ilink; a Fortran compiler from gfortran, g77,
          ifort, ifl, f95, f90, f77; and a static archiver 'ar'. It also
          selects all found from the list m4, rpm.

          On Windows systems, the default tools list selects
          (first-found): a C compiler from msvc, mingw, gcc, intelc, icl,
          icc, cc, bcc32; a C++ compiler from msvc, intelc, icc, g++, cxx,
          bcc32; an assembler from masm, nasm, gas, 386asm; a linker from
          mslink, gnulink, ilink, linkloc, ilink32; a Fortran compiler
          from gfortran, g77, ifl, cvf, f95, f90, fortran; and a static
          archiver from mslib, ar, tlib; It also selects all found from
          the list msvs, midl.

          On MacOS systems, the default tools list selects (first-found):
          a C compiler from gcc, cc; a C++ compiler from g++, cxx; an
          assembler 'as'; a linker from applelink, gnulink; a Fortran
          compiler from gfortran, f95, f90, g77; and a static archiver ar.
          It also selects all found from the list m4, rpm.

          Default lists for other platforms can be found by examining the
          scons source code (see SCons/Tool/__init__.py).

   dmd
          Sets construction variables for D language compiler DMD.

          Sets: [200]$DC, [201]$DCOM, [202]$DDEBUG, [203]$DDEBUGPREFIX,
          [204]$DDEBUGSUFFIX, [205]$DFILESUFFIX, [206]$DFLAGPREFIX,
          [207]$DFLAGS, [208]$DFLAGSUFFIX, [209]$DINCPREFIX,
          [210]$DINCSUFFIX, [211]$DLIB, [212]$DLIBCOM,

          [231]$SHDCOM, [232]$SHDLIBVERSIONFLAGS, [233]$SHDLINK,
          [234]$SHDLINKCOM, [235]$SHDLINKFLAGS.

   docbook
          This tool tries to make working with Docbook in SCons a little
          easier. It provides several toolchains for creating different
          output formats, like HTML or PDF. Contained in the package is a
          distribution of the Docbook XSL stylesheets as of version
          1.76.1. As long as you don't specify your own stylesheets for
          customization, these official versions are picked as
          default...which should reduce the inevitable setup hassles for
          you.

          Implicit dependencies to images and XIncludes are detected
          automatically if you meet the HTML requirements. The additional
          stylesheet utils/xmldepend.xsl by Paul DuBois is used for this
          purpose.

          Note, that there is no support for XML catalog resolving
          offered! This tool calls the XSLT processors and PDF renderers
          with the stylesheets you specified, that's it. The rest lies in
          your hands and you still have to know what you're doing when
          resolving names via a catalog.

          For activating the tool "docbook", you have to add its name to
          the Environment constructor, like this

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])

          On its startup, the Docbook tool tries to find a required
          xsltproc processor, and a PDF renderer, e.g. fop. So make sure
          that these are added to your system's environment PATH and can
          be called directly, without specifying their full path.

          For the most basic processing of Docbook to HTML, you need to
          have installed

          + the Python lxml binding to libxml2, or
          + a standalone XSLT processor, currently detected are xsltproc,
            saxon, saxon-xslt and xalan.

          Rendering to PDF requires you to have one of the applications
          fop or xep installed.

          Creating a HTML or PDF document is very simple and
          straightforward. Say

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')
env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          to get both outputs from your XML source manual.xml. As a
          shortcut, you can give the stem of the filenames alone, like
          this:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual')
env.DocbookPdf('manual')

          and get the same result. Target and source lists are also
          supported:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml(['manual.html','reference.html'], ['manual.xml','reference.xml']
)

          or even

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml(['manual','reference'])

Important

          Whenever you leave out the list of sources, you may not specify
          a file extension! The Tool uses the given names as file stems,
          and adds the suffixes for target and source files accordingly.

          The rules given above are valid for the Builders
          [236]DocbookHtml, [237]DocbookPdf, [238]DocbookEpub,
          [239]DocbookSlidesPdf and [240]DocbookXInclude. For the
          [241]DocbookMan transformation you can specify a target name,
          but the actual output names are automatically set from the
          refname entries in your XML source.

          The Builders [242]DocbookHtmlChunked, [243]DocbookHtmlhelp and
          [244]DocbookSlidesHtml are special, in that:

         1. they create a large set of files, where the exact names and
            their number depend on the content of the source file, and
         2. the main target is always named index.html, i.e. the output
            name for the XSL transformation is not picked up by the
            stylesheets.

          As a result, there is simply no use in specifying a target HTML
          name. So the basic syntax for these builders is always:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

          If you want to use a specific XSL file, you can set the
          additional xsl parameter to your Builder call as follows:

env.DocbookHtml('other.html', 'manual.xml', xsl='html.xsl')

          Since this may get tedious if you always use the same local
          naming for your customized XSL files, e.g. html.xsl for HTML and
          pdf.xsl for PDF output, a set of variables for setting the
          default XSL name is provided. These are:

DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML

DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_EPUB
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_MAN
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESPDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESHTML

          and you can set them when constructing your environment:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'],
                  DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML='html.xsl',
                  DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF='pdf.xsl')

   gettext
          This is actually a toolset, which supports internationalization
          and localization of software being constructed with SCons. The
          toolset loads following tools:

          + [409]xgettext - to extract internationalized messages from
            source code to POT file(s),
          + [410]msginit - may be optionally used to initialize PO files,
          + [411]msgmerge - to update PO files, that already contain
            translated messages,
          + [412]msgfmt - to compile textual PO file to binary installable
            MO file.

          When you enable gettext, it internally loads all abovementioned
          tools, so you're encouraged to see their individual
          documentation.

          Each of the above tools provides its own builder(s) which may be
          used to perform particular activities related to software
          internationalization. You may be however interested in top-level
          builder Translate described few paragraphs later.

          To use gettext tools add 'gettext' tool to your environment:

  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'gettext'] )

Builder Methods

   You tell scons what to build by calling Builders, functions which know
   to take a particular action to produce a particular result type when
   given source files of a particular type. scons defines a number of
   builders, and you can also write your own. Builders are attached to a
   construction environment as methods, and the available builder methods
   are listed as key-value pairs in the BUILDERS attribute of the
   construction environment. The available builders can be displayed like
   this for debugging purposes:
print("Builders:", list(env['BUILDERS']))

   Builder methods always take two arguments: target (a target or a list
   of targets to be built) and source (a source or list of sources to be
   used as input when building), although in some circumstances, the
   target argument can actually be omitted (see below). Builder methods
   also take a variety of keyword arguments, described below.

   Because long lists of file names can lead to a lot of quoting, scons
   supplies a [989]Split global function and a same-named environment
   method that splits a single string into a list, using strings of
   white-space characters as the delimiter. (similar to the Python string
   split method, but succeeds even if the input isn't a string.)

   The target and source arguments to a builder method can be specified
   either as positional arguments, in which case the target comes first,
   or as keyword arguments, using target= and source=. The following are
   equivalent examples of calling the Program builder method:
env.Program('bar', ['bar.c', 'foo.c'])
env.Program('bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(source=['bar.c', 'foo.c'], target='bar')
env.Program(target='bar', source=Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(target='bar', source=env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', source='bar.c foo.c'.split())

   Python follows the POSIX pathname convention for path strings: if a
   string begins with the operating system pathname separator (on Windows
   both the slash and backslash separator work, and any leading drive
   specifier is ignored for the determination) it is considered an
   absolute path, otherwise it is a relative path. If the path string
   contains no separator characters, it is searched for as a file in the
   current directory. If it contains separator characters, the search
   follows down from the starting point, which is the top of the directory
   tree for an absolute path and the current directory for a relative
   path.

   scons recognizes a third way to specify path strings: if the string
   begins with the # character it is top-relative - it works like a
   relative path but the search follows down from the directory containing
   the top-level SConstruct rather than from the current directory. The #
   is allowed to be followed by a pathname separator, which is ignored if
   found in that position. Top-relative paths only work in places where
   scons will interpret the path (see some examples below). To be used in
   other contexts the string will need to be converted to a relative or
   absolute path first.

   Target and source pathnames can be absolute, relative, or top-relative.
   Relative pathnames are searched considering the directory of the
   SConscript file currently being processed as the "current directory".

   Examples:
# The comments describing the targets that will be built
# assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the
# a subdirectory named "subdir".

# Builds the program "subdir/foo" from "subdir/foo.c":
env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

# Builds the program "/tmp/bar" from "subdir/bar.c":
env.Program('/tmp/bar', 'bar.c')

# An initial '#' or '#/' are equivalent; the following
# calls build the programs "foo" and "bar" (in the
# top-level SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c" and
# "subdir/bar.c", respectively:
env.Program('#foo', 'foo.c')
env.Program('#/bar', 'bar.c')

# Builds the program "other/foo" (relative to the top-level
# SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c":
env.Program('#other/foo', 'foo.c')

# This will not work, only SCons interfaces understand '#',
# os.path.exists is pure Python:
if os.path.exists('#inc/foo.h'):
    env.Append(CPPPATH='#inc')

   When the target shares the same base name as the source and only the
   suffix varies, and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the
   target file type, then the target argument may be omitted completely,
   and scons will deduce the target file name from the source file name.
   The following examples all build the executable program bar (on POSIX
   systems) or bar.exe (on Windows systems) from the bar.c source file:
env.Program(target='bar', source='bar.c')
env.Program('bar', source='bar.c')
env.Program(source='bar.c')
env.Program('bar.c')

   As a convenience, a srcdir keyword argument may be specified when
   calling a Builder. When specified, all source file strings that are not
   absolute paths or top-relative paths will be interpreted relative to
   the specified srcdir. The following example will build the build/prog
   (or build/prog.exe on Windows) program from the files src/f1.c and
   src/f2.c:
env.Program('build/prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c'], srcdir='src')

   Keyword arguments that are not specifically recognized are treated as
   construction variable overrides, which replace or add those variables
   on a limited basis. These overrides will only be in effect when
   building the target of the builder call, and will not affect other
   parts of the build. For example, if you want to specify some libraries
   needed by just one program:
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])

   or generate a shared library with a non-standard suffix:
env.SharedLibrary(
    target='word',
    source='word.cpp',
    SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx',
    LIBSUFFIXES=['.ocx'],
)

   Note that both the [990]$SHLIBSUFFIX and [991]$LIBSUFFIXES variables
   must be set if you want scons to search automatically for dependencies
   on the non-standard library names; see the descriptions below of these
   variables for more information.

   The optional parse_flags keyword argument is recognized by builders.
   This works similarly to the [992]env.MergeFlags method, where the
   argument value is broken into individual settings and merged into the
   appropriate construction variables.
env = Program('hello', 'hello.c', parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

   This example adds 'include' to CPPPATH, 'EBUG' to CPPDEFINES, and 'm'
   to LIBS.

   Although the builder methods defined by scons are, in fact, methods of
   a construction environment object, many may also be called without an
   explicit environment:
Program('hello', 'hello.c')
SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp')

   If called this way, methods will internally use the default environment
   that consists of the tools and values that scons has determined are
   appropriate for the local system.

   Builder methods that can be called without an explicit environment
   (indicated in the listing of builders without a leading env.) may be
   called from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript
   file by adding the following to the Python module:
from SCons.Script import *

   All builder methods return a list-like object containing Nodes that
   will be built. A Node is an internal SCons object which represents
   build targets or sources. See [993]the section called "File and
   Directory Nodes" for more information.

   The returned Node-list object can be passed to other builder methods as
   source(s) or passed to any SCons function or method where a filename
   would normally be accepted. For example, if it were necessary to add a
   specific preprocessor define when compiling one specific object file:
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
env.Program(source=['foo.c', bar_obj_list, 'main.c'])

   Using a Node in this way makes for a more portable build by avoiding
   having to specify a platform-specific object suffix when calling the
   Program builder method.

   Builder calls will automatically "flatten" lists passed as source and
   target, so they are free to contain elements which are themselves
   lists, such as bar_obj_list returned by the StaticObject call above. If
   you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by builders directly in
   Python code, you can either build a new list by hand:
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = ['begin.o'] + foo + ['middle.o'] + bar + ['end.o']
for obj in objects:
    print(str(obj))

   Or you can use the [994]Flatten function supplied by scons to create a
   list containing just the Nodes, which may be more convenient:
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = Flatten(['begin.o', foo, 'middle.o', bar, 'end.o'])
for obj in objects:
    print(str(obj))

   SCons builder calls return a list-like object, not an actual Python
   list, so it is not appropriate to use the Python add operator (+ or +=)
   to append builder results to a Python list. Because the list and the
   object are different types, Python will not update the original list in
   place, but will instead create a new Node-list object containing the
   concatenation of the list elements and the builder results. This will
   cause problems for any other Python variables in your SCons
   configuration that still hold on to a reference to the original list.
   Instead, use the Python list extend method to make sure the list is
   updated in-place. Example:
object_files = []

# Do NOT use += here:
#    object_files += Object('bar.c')
#
# It will not update the object_files list in place.
#
# Instead, use the list extend method:
object_files.extend(Object('bar.c'))

   The path name for a Node's file may be used by passing the Node to
   Python's builtin str function:
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
print("The path to bar_obj is:", str(bar_obj_list[0]))

   Note again that because the Builder call returns a list, we have to
   access the first element in the list ((bar_obj_list[0])) to get at the
   Node that actually represents the object file.

   Builder calls support a chdir keyword argument that specifies that the
   Builder's action(s) should be executed after changing directory. If the
   chdir argument is a string or a directory Node, scons will change to
   the specified directory. If the chdir is not a string or Node and is
   non-zero, then scons will change to the target file's directory.
# scons will change to the "sub" subdirectory
# before executing the "cp" command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in',
            "cp dir/foo.in dir/foo.out",
            chdir='sub')

# Because chdir is not a string, scons will change to the
# target's directory ("sub/dir") before executing the
# "cp" command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in',
            "cp foo.in foo.out",
            chdir=1)

   Note that SCons will not automatically modify its expansion of
   construction variables like $TARGET and $SOURCE when using the chdir
   keyword argument--that is, the expanded file names will still be
   relative to the top-level directory where SConstruct was found, and
   consequently incorrect relative to the chdir directory. If you use the
   chdir keyword argument, you will typically need to supply a different
   command line using expansions like ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to
   use just the filename portion of the targets and source.

   scons predefines the following builder methods. Depending on the setup
   of a particular construction environment and on the type and software
   installation status of the underlying system, not all builders may be
   available to that construction environment.

   CFile()
          env.CFile()
          Builds a C source file given a lex (.l) or yacc (.y) input file.
          The suffix specified by the [995]$CFILESUFFIX construction
          variable (.c by default) is automatically added to the target if
          it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.c
env.CFile(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.l')
# builds bar.c
env.CFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.y')

   Command()
          env.Command()
          The Command "Builder" is actually a function that looks like a
          Builder, but takes a required third argument, which is the
          action to take to construct the target from the source, used for
          "one-off" builds where a full builder is not needed. Thus it
          does not follow the builder calling rules described at the start
          of this section. See instead the [996]Command function
          description for the calling syntax and details.

   CompilationDatabase()
          env.CompilationDatabase()
          CompilationDatabase is a special builder which adds a target to
          create a JSON formatted compilation database compatible with
          clang tooling (see the [997]LLVM specification). This database
          is suitable for consumption by various tools and editors who can
          use it to obtain build and dependency information which
          otherwise would be internal to SCons. The builder does not
          require any source files to be specified, rather it arranges to
          emit information about all of the C, C++ and assembler
          source/output pairs identified in the build that are not
          excluded by the optional filter [998]$COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER.
          The target is subject to the usual SCons target selection rules.

          If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a
          target name of compile_commands.json.

          If called with a single positional argument, scons will "deduce"
          the target name from that source argument, giving it the same
          name, and then ignore the source. This is the usual way to call
          the builder if a non-default target name is wanted.

          If called with either the target= or source= keyword arguments,
          the value of the argument is taken as the target name. If called
          with both, the target= value is used and source= is ignored. If
          called with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored,
          since there is no way to deduce what the intent was; in this
          case the default target name will be used.

Note

          You must load the compilation_db tool prior to specifying any
          part of your build or some source/output files will not show up
          in the compilation database.

          Available since scons 4.0.

   CXXFile()
          env.CXXFile()
          Builds a C++ source file given a lex (.ll) or yacc (.yy) input
          file. The suffix specified by the [999]$CXXFILESUFFIX
          construction variable (.cc by default) is automatically added to
          the target if it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'foo.cc', source = 'foo.ll')
# builds bar.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.yy')

   DocbookEpub()
          env.DocbookEpub()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for EPUB output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookEpub('manual.epub', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookEpub('manual')

   DocbookHtml()
          env.DocbookHtml()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual')

   DocbookHtmlChunked()
          env.DocbookHtmlChunked()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for chunked HTML
          output. It supports the base.dir parameter. The chunkfast.xsl
          file (requires "EXSLT") is used as the default stylesheet. Basic
          syntax:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file.

          If you use the root.filename parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to specify the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir is provided. You can add the
          base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given prefix gets
          prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookHtmlhelp()
          env.DocbookHtmlhelp()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTMLHELP
          output. Its basic syntax is:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file.

          If you use the root.filename parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to specify the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You
          can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given
          prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookMan()
          env.DocbookMan()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for Man page
          output. Its basic syntax is:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookMan('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file. Note, that you can specify a
          target name, but the actual output names are automatically set
          from the refname entries in your XML source.

   DocbookPdf()
          env.DocbookPdf()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookPdf('manual')

   DocbookSlidesHtml()
          env.DocbookSlidesHtml()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML slides
          output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual')

          If you use the titlefoil.html parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to give the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('mymanual.html','manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You
          can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given
          prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookSlidesPdf()
          env.DocbookSlidesPdf()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF slides
          output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual')

   DocbookXInclude()
          env.DocbookXInclude()
          A pseudo-Builder, for resolving XIncludes in a separate
          processing step.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookXInclude('manual_xincluded.xml', 'manual.xml')

   DocbookXslt()
          env.DocbookXslt()
          A pseudo-Builder, applying a given XSL transformation to the
          input file.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookXslt('manual_transformed.xml', 'manual.xml', xsl='transform.xslt')

          Note, that this builder requires the xsl parameter to be set.

   DVI()
          env.DVI()
          Builds a .dvi file from a .tex, .ltx or .latex input file. If
          the source file suffix is .tex, scons will examine the contents
          of the file; if the string \documentclass or \documentstyle is
          found, the file is assumed to be a LaTeX file and the target is
          built by invoking the [1000]$LATEXCOM command line; otherwise,
          the [1001]$TEXCOM command line is used. If the file is a LaTeX
          file, the DVI builder method will also examine the contents of
          the .aux file and invoke the [1002]$BIBTEX command line if the
          string bibdata is found, start [1003]$MAKEINDEX to generate an
          index if a .ind file is found and will examine the contents .log
          file and re-run the [1004]$LATEXCOM command if the log file says
          it is necessary.

          The suffix .dvi (hard-coded within TeX itself) is automatically
          added to the target if it is not already present. Examples:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.DVI(target = 'aaa.dvi', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.dvi
env.DVI(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.ltx')
# builds from ccc.latex
env.DVI(target = 'ccc.dvi', source = 'ccc.latex')

   Gs()
          env.Gs()
          A Builder for explicitly calling the gs executable. Depending on
          the underlying OS, the different names gs, gsos2 and gswin32c
          are tried.

env = Environment(tools=['gs'])
env.Gs('cover.jpg','scons-scons.pdf',
       GSFLAGS='-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=jpeg -dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=1 -q')
       )

   Install()
          env.Install()
          Installs one or more source files or directories in the
          specified target, which must be a directory. The names of the
          specified source files or directories remain the same within the
          destination directory. The sources may be given as a string or
          as a node returned by a builder.

env.Install(target='/usr/local/bin', source=['foo', 'bar'])

          Note that if target paths chosen for the Install builder (and
          the related InstallAs and InstallVersionedLib builders) are
          outside the project tree, such as in the example above, they may
          not be selected for "building" by default, since in the absence
          of other instructions scons builds targets that are underneath
          the top directory (the directory that contains the SConstruct
          file, usually the current directory). Use command line targets
          or the Default function in this case.

          If the --install-sandbox command line option is given, the
          target directory will be prefixed by the directory path
          specified. This is useful to test installs without installing to
          a "live" location in the system.

          See also FindInstalledFiles. For more thoughts on installation,
          see the User Guide (particularly the section on Command-Line
          Targets and the chapters on Installing Files and on Alias
          Targets).

   InstallAs()
          env.InstallAs()
          Installs one or more source files or directories to specific
          names, allowing changing a file or directory name as part of the
          installation. It is an error if the target and source arguments
          list different numbers of files or directories.

env.InstallAs(target='/usr/local/bin/foo',
              source='foo_debug')
env.InstallAs(target=['../lib/libfoo.a', '../lib/libbar.a'],
              source=['libFOO.a', 'libBAR.a'])

          See the note under Install.

   InstallVersionedLib()
          env.InstallVersionedLib()
          Installs a versioned shared library. The symlinks appropriate to
          the architecture will be generated based on symlinks of the
          source library.

env.InstallVersionedLib(target='/usr/local/bin/foo',
                        source='libxyz.1.5.2.so')

          See the note under Install.

   Jar()
          env.Jar()
          Builds a Java archive (.jar) file from the specified list of
          sources. Any directories in the source list will be searched for
          .class files). Any .java files in the source list will be
          compiled to .class files by calling the [1005]Java Builder.

          If the [1006]$JARCHDIR value is set, the jar command will change
          to the specified directory using the -C option. If $JARCHDIR is
          not set explicitly, SCons will use the top of any subdirectory
          tree in which Java .class were built by the [1007]Java Builder.

          If the contents any of the source files begin with the string
          Manifest-Version, the file is assumed to be a manifest and is
          passed to the jar command with the m option set.

env.Jar(target = 'foo.jar', source = 'classes')

env.Jar(target = 'bar.jar',
        source = ['bar1.java', 'bar2.java'])

   Java()
          env.Java()
          Builds one or more Java class files. The sources may be any
          combination of explicit .java files, or directory trees which
          will be scanned for .java files.

          SCons will parse each source .java file to find the classes
          (including inner classes) defined within that file, and from
          that figure out the target .class files that will be created.
          The class files will be placed underneath the specified target
          directory.

          SCons will also search each Java file for the Java package name,
          which it assumes can be found on a line beginning with the
          string package in the first column; the resulting .class files
          will be placed in a directory reflecting the specified package
          name. For example, the file Foo.java defining a single public
          Foo class and containing a package name of sub.dir will generate
          a corresponding sub/dir/Foo.class class file.

          Examples:

env.Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['src1', 'src2'])
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['File1.java', 'File2.java'])

          Java source files can use the native encoding for the underlying
          OS. Since SCons compiles in simple ASCII mode by default, the
          compiler will generate warnings about unmappable characters,
          which may lead to errors as the file is processed further. In
          this case, the user must specify the LANG environment variable
          to tell the compiler what encoding is used. For portibility,
          it's best if the encoding is hard-coded so that the compile will
          work if it is done on a system with a different encoding.

env = Environment()
env['ENV']['LANG'] = 'en_GB.UTF-8'

   JavaH()
          env.JavaH()
          Builds C header and source files for implementing Java native
          methods. The target can be either a directory in which the
          header files will be written, or a header file name which will
          contain all of the definitions. The source can be the names of
          .class files, the names of .java files to be compiled into
          .class files by calling the [1008]Java builder method, or the
          objects returned from the Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [1009]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the JavaH builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

          Examples:

# builds java_native.h
classes = env.Java(target="classdir", source="src")
env.JavaH(target="java_native.h", source=classes)

# builds include/package_foo.h and include/package_bar.h
env.JavaH(target="include", source=["package/foo.class", "package/bar.class"])

# builds export/foo.h and export/bar.h
env.JavaH(
    target="export",
    source=["classes/foo.class", "classes/bar.class"],
    JAVACLASSDIR="classes",
)

   Library()
          env.Library()
          A synonym for the StaticLibrary builder method.

   LoadableModule()
          env.LoadableModule()
          On most systems, this is the same as SharedLibrary. On Mac OS X
          (Darwin) platforms, this creates a loadable module bundle.

   M4()
          env.M4()
          Builds an output file from an M4 input file. This uses a default
          [1010]$M4FLAGS value of -E, which considers all warnings to be
          fatal and stops on the first warning when using the GNU version
          of m4. Example:

env.M4(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.c.m4')

   Moc()
          env.Moc()
          Builds an output file from a moc input file. Moc input files are
          either header files or cxx files. This builder is only available
          after using the tool 'qt'. See the [1011]$QTDIR variable for
          more information. Example:

env.Moc('foo.h') # generates moc_foo.cc
env.Moc('foo.cpp') # generates foo.moc

   MOFiles()
          env.MOFiles()
          This builder belongs to [1012]msgfmt tool. The builder compiles
          PO files to MO files.

          Example 1. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po:

  # ...
  env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'])

          Example 2. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

  # ...
  env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 3. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po
          plus files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

  # ...
  env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 4. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file
          (another version):

  # ...
  env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
  env.MOFiles()

   MSVSProject()
          env.MSVSProject()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio project file, and by default
          builds a solution file as well.

          This builds a Visual Studio project file, based on the version
          of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [1013]$MSVS_VERSION in the
          Environment constructor). For Visual Studio 6, it will generate
          a .dsp file. For Visual Studio 7, 8, and 9, it will generate a
          .vcproj file. For Visual Studio 10 and later, it will generate a
          .vcxproj file.

          By default, this also generates a solution file for the
          specified project, a .dsw file for Visual Studio 6 or a .sln
          file for Visual Studio 7 and later. This behavior may be
          disabled by specifying auto_build_solution=0 when you call
          MSVSProject, in which case you presumably want to build the
          solution file(s) by calling the MSVSSolution Builder (see
          below).

          The MSVSProject builder takes several lists of filenames to be
          placed into the project file. These are currently limited to
          srcs, incs, localincs, resources, and misc. These are pretty
          self-explanatory, but it should be noted that these lists are
          added to the [1014]$SOURCES construction variable as strings,
          NOT as SCons File Nodes. This is because they represent file
          names to be added to the project file, not the source files used
          to build the project file.

          The above filename lists are all optional, although at least one
          must be specified for the resulting project file to be
          non-empty.

          In addition to the above lists of values, the following values
          may be specified:

        target
                The name of the target .dsp or .vcproj file. The correct
                suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but
                the [1015]$MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX construction variable will be
                defined to the correct value (see example below).

        variant
                The name of this particular variant. For Visual Studio 7
                projects, this can also be a list of variant names. These
                are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really
                can be anything you want. For Visual Studio 7 projects,
                they may also specify a target platform separated from the
                variant name by a | (vertical pipe) character: Debug|Xbox.
                The default target platform is Win32. Multiple calls to
                MSVSProject with different variants are allowed; all
                variants will be added to the project file with their
                appropriate build targets and sources.

        cmdargs
                Additional command line arguments for the different
                variants. The number of cmdargs entries must match the
                number of variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If
                you give only one, it will automatically be propagated to
                all variants.

        cppdefines
                Preprocessor definitions for the different variants. The
                number of cppdefines entries must match the number of
                variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give
                only one, it will automatically be propagated to all
                variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use
                the invoking environment's CPPDEFINES entry for all
                variants.

        cppflags
                Compiler flags for the different variants. If a /std:c++
                flag is found then /Zc:__cplusplus is appended to the
                flags if not already found, this ensures that intellisense
                uses the /std:c++ switch. The number of cppflags entries
                must match the number of variant entries, or be empty (not
                specified). If you give only one, it will automatically be
                propagated to all variants. If you don't give this
                parameter, SCons will combine the invoking environment's
                CCFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, CPPFLAGS entries for all variants.

        cpppaths
                Compiler include paths for the different variants. The
                number of cpppaths entries must match the number of
                variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give
                only one, it will automatically be propagated to all
                variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use
                the invoking environment's CPPPATH entry for all variants.

        buildtarget
                An optional string, node, or list of strings or nodes (one
                per build variant), to tell the Visual Studio debugger
                what output target to use in what build variant. The
                number of buildtarget entries must match the number of
                variant entries.

        runfile
                The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later will
                run and debug. This appears as the value of the Output
                field in the resulting Visual Studio project file. If this
                is not specified, the default is the same as the specified
                buildtarget value.

          Note that because SCons always executes its build commands from
          the directory in which the SConstruct file is located, if you
          generate a project file in a different directory than the
          SConstruct directory, users will not be able to double-click on
          the file name in compilation error messages displayed in the
          Visual Studio console output window. This can be remedied by
          adding the Visual C/C++ /FC compiler option to the
          [1016]$CCFLAGS variable so that the compiler will print the full
          path name of any files that cause compilation errors.

          Example usage:

barsrcs = ['bar.cpp']
barincs = ['bar.h']
barlocalincs = ['StdAfx.h']
barresources = ['bar.rc','resource.h']
barmisc = ['bar_readme.txt']

dll = env.SharedLibrary(target='bar.dll',
                        source=barsrcs)
buildtarget = [s for s in dll if str(s).endswith('dll')]
env.MSVSProject(target='Bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX'],
                srcs=barsrcs,
                incs=barincs,
                localincs=barlocalincs,
                resources=barresources,
                misc=barmisc,
                buildtarget=buildtarget,
                variant='Release')

          Starting with version 2.4 of SCons it is also possible to
          specify the optional argument DebugSettings, which creates files
          for debugging under Visual Studio:

        DebugSettings
                A dictionary of debug settings that get written to the
                .vcproj.user or the .vcxproj.user file, depending on the
                version installed. As it is done for cmdargs (see above),
                you can specify a DebugSettings dictionary per variant. If
                you give only one, it will be propagated to all variants.

          Currently, only Visual Studio v9.0 and Visual Studio version v11
          are implemented, for other versions no file is generated. To
          generate the user file, you just need to add a DebugSettings
          dictionary to the environment with the right parameters for your
          MSVS version. If the dictionary is empty, or does not contain
          any good value, no file will be generated.

          Following is a more contrived example, involving the setup of a
          project for variants and DebugSettings:

# Assuming you store your defaults in a file
vars = Variables('variables.py')
msvcver = vars.args.get('vc', '9')

# Check command args to force one Microsoft Visual Studio version
if msvcver == '9' or msvcver == '11':
  env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION=msvcver+'.0', MSVC_BATCH=False)
else:
  env = Environment()

AddOption('--userfile', action='store_true', dest='userfile', default=False,
          help="Create Visual Studio Project user file")

#
# 1. Configure your Debug Setting dictionary with options you want in the list

   MSVSSolution()
          env.MSVSSolution()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.

          This builds a Visual Studio solution file, based on the version
          of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [1017]$MSVS_VERSION in the
          construction environment). For Visual Studio 6, it will generate
          a .dsw file. For Visual Studio 7 (.NET), it will generate a .sln
          file.

          The following values must be specified:

        target
                The name of the target .dsw or .sln file. The correct
                suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but
                the value [1018]$MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX will be defined to the
                correct value (see example below).

        variant
                The name of this particular variant, or a list of variant
                names (the latter is only supported for MSVS 7 solutions).
                These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but
                really can be anything you want. For MSVS 7 they may also
                specify target platform, like this "Debug|Xbox". Default
                platform is Win32.

        projects
                A list of project file names, or Project nodes returned by
                calls to the MSVSProject Builder, to be placed into the
                solution file. It should be noted that these file names
                are NOT added to the $SOURCES environment variable in form
                of files, but rather as strings. This is because they
                represent file names to be added to the solution file, not
                the source files used to build the solution file.

          Example Usage:

env.MSVSSolution(
    target="Bar" + env["MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX"],
    projects=["bar" + env["MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX"]],
    variant="Release",
)

   Object()
          env.Object()
          A synonym for the StaticObject builder method.

   Package()
          env.Package()
          Builds software distribution packages. A Package is a container
          format which includes files to install along with metadata.
          Packaging is optional, and must be enabled by specifying the
          [1019]packaging tool. For example:

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'packaging'])

          SCons can build packages in a number of well known packaging
          formats. The target package type may be selected with the the
          [1020]$PACKAGETYPE construction variable or the --package-type
          command line option. The package type may be a list, in which
          case SCons will attempt to build packages for each type in the
          list. Example:

env.Package(PACKAGETYPE=['src_zip', 'src_targz'], ...other args...)

          The currently supported packagers are:

   msi Microsoft Installer package
   rpm RPM Package Manger package
   ipkg Itsy Package Management package
   tarbz2 bzip2-compressed tar file
   targz gzip-compressed tar file
   tarxz xz-compressed tar file
   zip zip file
   src_tarbz2 bzip2-compressed tar file suitable as source to another
   packager
   src_targz gzip-compressed tar file suitable as source to another
   packager
   src_tarxz xz-compressed tar file suitable as source to another packager
   src_zip zip file suitable as source to another packager

          The file list to include in the package may be specified with
          the source keyword argument. If omitted, the
          [1021]FindInstalledFiles function is called behind the scenes to
          select all files that have an [1022]Install, [1023]InstallAs or
          [1024]InstallVersionedLib Builder attached. If the target
          keyword argument is omitted, the target name(s) will be deduced
          from the package type(s).

          The metadata comes partly from attributes of the files to be
          packaged, and partly from packaging tags. Tags can be passed as
          keyword arguments to the Package builder call, and may also be
          attached to files (or more accurately, Nodes representing files)
          with the [1025]Tag function. Some package-level tags are
          mandatory, and will lead to errors if omitted. The mandatory
          tags vary depending on the package type.

          While packaging, the builder uses a temporary location named by
          the value of the [1026]$PACKAGEROOT variable - the package
          sources are copied there before packaging.

          Packaging example:

env = Environment(tools=["default", "packaging"])
env.Install("/bin/", "my_program")
env.Package(
    NAME="foo",
    VERSION="1.2.3",
    PACKAGEVERSION=0,
    PACKAGETYPE="rpm",
    LICENSE="gpl",
    SUMMARY="balalalalal",
    DESCRIPTION="this should be really really long",
    X_RPM_GROUP="Application/fu",
    SOURCE_URL="http://foo.org/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz",
)

          In this example, the target /bin/my_program created by the
          Install call would not be built by default since it is not under
          the project top directory. However, since no source is specified
          to the Package builder, it is selected for packaging by the
          default sources rule. Since packaging is done using
          $PACKAGEROOT, no write is actually done to the system's /bin
          directory, and the target will be selected since after rebasing
          to underneath $PACKAGEROOT it is now under the top directory of
          the project.

   PCH()
          env.PCH()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header. Calling this
          builder method returns a list of two targets: the PCH as the
          first element, and the object file as the second element.
          Normally the object file is ignored. This builder method is only
          provided when Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the
          compiler. The PCH builder method is generally used in
          conjunction with the PCH construction variable to force object
          files to use the precompiled header:

env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]

   PDF()
          env.PDF()
          Builds a .pdf file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [1027]$PDFSUFFIX construction variable (.pdf by default) is
          added automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PDF(target = 'aaa.pdf', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.pdf from bbb.dvi
env.PDF(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   POInit()
          env.POInit()
          This builder belongs to [1028]msginit tool. The builder
          initializes missing PO file(s) if [1029]$POAUTOINIT is set. If
          [1030]$POAUTOINIT is not set (default), POInit prints
          instruction for user (that is supposed to be a translator),
          telling how the PO file should be initialized. In normal
          projects you should not use POInit and use [1031]POUpdate
          instead. [1032]POUpdate chooses intelligently between
          msgmerge(1) and msginit(1). POInit always uses msginit(1) and
          should be regarded as builder for special purposes or for
          temporary use (e.g. for quick, one time initialization of a
          bunch of PO files) or for tests.

          Target nodes defined through POInit are not built by default
          (they're Ignored from '.' node) but are added to special Alias
          ('po-create' by default). The alias name may be changed through
          the [1033]$POCREATE_ALIAS construction variable. All PO files
          defined through POInit may be easily initialized by scons
          po-create.

          Example 1. Initialize en.po and pl.po from messages.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl']) # messages.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 2. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], ['foo']) # foo.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 3. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot but using
          [1034]$POTDOMAIN construction variable:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo') # foo.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 4. Initialize PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS
          file. The files will be initialized from template messages.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(LINGUAS_FILE = 1) # needs 'LINGUAS' file

          Example 5. Initialize en.po and pl.pl PO files plus files for
          languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files will be initialized
          from template messages.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 6. You may preconfigure your environment first, and then
          initialize PO files:

  # ...
  env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
  env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
  env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
  env.POInit()

          which has same efect as:

  # ...
  env.POInit(POAUTOINIT = 1, LINGUAS_FILE = 1, POTDOMAIN = 'foo')

   PostScript()
          env.PostScript()
          Builds a .ps file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [1035]$PSSUFFIX construction variable (.ps by default) is added
          automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PostScript(target = 'aaa.ps', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.ps from bbb.dvi
env.PostScript(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   POTUpdate()
          env.POTUpdate()
          The builder belongs to [1036]xgettext tool. The builder updates
          target POT file if exists or creates one if it doesn't. The node
          is not built by default (i.e. it is Ignored from '.'), but only
          on demand (i.e. when given POT file is required or when special
          alias is invoked). This builder adds its targe node
          (messages.pot, say) to a special alias (pot-update by default,
          see [1037]$POTUPDATE_ALIAS) so you can update/create them easily
          with scons pot-update. The file is not written until there is no
          real change in internationalized messages (or in comments that
          enter POT file).

Note

          You may see xgettext(1) being invoked by the [1038]xgettext tool
          even if there is no real change in internationalized messages
          (so the POT file is not being updated). This happens every time
          a source file has changed. In such case we invoke xgettext(1)
          and compare its output with the content of POT file to decide
          whether the file should be updated or not.

          Example 1. Let's create po/ directory and place following
          SConstruct script there:

  # SConstruct in 'po/' subdir
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(['foo'], ['../a.cpp', '../b.cpp'])
  env.POTUpdate(['bar'], ['../c.cpp', '../d.cpp'])

          Then invoke scons few times:

  user@host:$ scons             # Does not create foo.pot nor bar.pot
  user@host:$ scons foo.pot     # Updates or creates foo.pot
  user@host:$ scons pot-update  # Updates or creates foo.pot and bar.pot
  user@host:$ scons -c          # Does not clean foo.pot nor bar.pot.

          the results shall be as the comments above say.

          Example 2. The POTUpdate builder may be used with no target
          specified, in which case default target messages.pot will be
          used. The default target may also be overridden by setting
          [1039]$POTDOMAIN construction variable or providing it as an
          override to POTUpdate builder:


  # SConstruct script
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env['POTDOMAIN'] = "foo"
  env.POTUpdate(source = ["a.cpp", "b.cpp"]) # Creates foo.pot ...
  env.POTUpdate(POTDOMAIN = "bar", source = ["c.cpp", "d.cpp"]) # and bar.pot

          Example 3. The sources may be specified within separate file,
          for example POTFILES.in:


  # POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory
  ../a.cpp
  ../b.cpp
  # end of file

          The name of the file (POTFILES.in) containing the list of
          sources is provided via [1040]$XGETTEXTFROM:


  # SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in')

          Example 4. You may use [1041]$XGETTEXTPATH to define source
          search path. Assume, for example, that you have files a.cpp,
          b.cpp, po/SConstruct, po/POTFILES.in. Then your POT-related
          files could look as below:

  # POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory
  a.cpp
  b.cpp
  # end of file

  # SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH='../')

          Example 5. Multiple search directories may be defined within a
          list, i.e. XGETTEXTPATH = ['dir1', 'dir2', ...]. The order in
          the list determines the search order of source files. The path
          to the first file found is used.

          Let's create 0/1/po/SConstruct script:

  # SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../', '../../'])

          and 0/1/po/POTFILES.in:

  # POTFILES.in in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
  a.cpp
  # end of file

          Write two *.cpp files, the first one is 0/a.cpp:

  /* 0/a.cpp */
  gettext("Hello from ../../a.cpp")

          and the second is 0/1/a.cpp:

  /* 0/1/a.cpp */
  gettext("Hello from ../a.cpp")

          then run scons. You'll obtain 0/1/po/messages.pot with the
          message "Hello from ../a.cpp". When you reverse order in
          $XGETTEXTFOM, i.e. when you write SConscript as

  # SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../../', '../'])

          then the messages.pot will contain msgid "Hello from
          ../../a.cpp" line and not msgid "Hello from ../a.cpp".

   POUpdate()
          env.POUpdate()
          The builder belongs to [1042]msgmerge tool. The builder updates
          PO files with msgmerge(1), or initializes missing PO files as
          described in documentation of [1043]msginit tool and
          [1044]POInit builder (see also [1045]$POAUTOINIT). Note, that
          POUpdate does not add its targets to po-create alias as
          [1046]POInit does.

          Target nodes defined through POUpdate are not built by default
          (they're Ignored from '.' node). Instead, they are added
          automatically to special Alias ('po-update' by default). The
          alias name may be changed through the [1047]$POUPDATE_ALIAS
          construction variable. You can easily update PO files in your
          project by scons po-update.

          Example 1. Update en.po and pl.po from messages.pot template
          (see also [1048]$POTDOMAIN), assuming that the later one exists
          or there is rule to build it (see [1049]POTUpdate):

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(['en','pl']) # messages.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 2. Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot template:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], ['foo']) # foo.pot -->  [en.po, pl.pl]

          Example 3. Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot (another
          version):

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo') # foo.pot -- > [en.po, pl.pl]

          Example 4. Update files for languages defined in LINGUAS file.
          The files are updated from messages.pot template:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1) # needs 'LINGUAS' file

          Example 5. Same as above, but update from foo.pot template:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, source = ['foo'])

          Example 6. Update en.po and pl.po plus files for languages
          defined in LINGUAS file. The files are updated from messages.pot
          template:

  # produce 'en.po', 'pl.po' + files defined in 'LINGUAS':
  env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl' ], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 7. Use [1050]$POAUTOINIT to automatically initialize PO
          file if it doesn't exist:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, POAUTOINIT = 1)

          Example 8. Update PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS
          file. The files are updated from foo.pot template. All necessary
          settings are pre-configured via environment.

  # ...
  env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
  env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
  env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
  env.POUpdate()

   Program()
          env.Program()
          Builds an executable given one or more object files or C, C++,
          D, or Fortran source files. If any C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files are specified, then they will be automatically compiled to
          object files using the Object builder method; see that builder
          method's description for a list of legal source file suffixes
          and how they are interpreted. The target executable file prefix,
          specified by the [1051]$PROGPREFIX construction variable
          (nothing by default), and suffix, specified by the
          [1052]$PROGSUFFIX construction variable (by default, .exe on
          Windows systems, nothing on POSIX systems), are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.Program(target='foo', source=['foo.o', 'bar.c', 'baz.f'])

   ProgramAllAtOnce()
          env.ProgramAllAtOnce()
          Builds an executable from D sources without first creating
          individual objects for each file.

          D sources can be compiled file-by-file as C and C++ source are,
          and D is integrated into the scons Object and Program builders
          for this model of build. D codes can though do whole source
          meta-programming (some of the testing frameworks do this). For
          this it is imperative that all sources are compiled and linked
          in a single call to the D compiler. This builder serves that
          purpose.

    env.ProgramAllAtOnce('executable', ['mod_a.d, mod_b.d', 'mod_c.d'])

          This command will compile the modules mod_a, mod_b, and mod_c in
          a single compilation process without first creating object files
          for the modules. Some of the D compilers will create
          executable.o others will not.

   RES()
          env.RES()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ resource file. This builder method
          is only provided when Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW is being
          used as the compiler. The .res (or .o for MinGW) suffix is added
          to the target name if no other suffix is given. The source file
          is scanned for implicit dependencies as though it were a C file.
          Example:

env.RES('resource.rc')

   RMIC()
          env.RMIC()
          Builds stub and skeleton class files for remote objects from
          Java .class files. The target is a directory relative to which
          the stub and skeleton class files will be written. The source
          can be the names of .class files, or the objects return from the
          Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [1053]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the RMIC builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

classes = env.Java(target = 'classdir', source = 'src')
env.RMIC(target = 'outdir1', source = classes)

env.RMIC(target = 'outdir2',
         source = ['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'])

env.RMIC(target = 'outdir3',
         source = ['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
         JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes')

   RPCGenClient()
          env.RPCGenClient()
          Generates an RPC client stub (_clnt.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_clnt.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenHeader()
          env.RPCGenHeader()
          Generates an RPC header (.h) file from a specified RPC (.x)
          source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif.h
env.RPCGenHeader('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenService()
          env.RPCGenService()
          Generates an RPC server-skeleton (_svc.c) file from a specified
          RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in
          the local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_svc.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenXDR()
          env.RPCGenXDR()
          Generates an RPC XDR routine (_xdr.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_xdr.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   SharedLibrary()
          env.SharedLibrary()
          Builds a shared library (.so on a POSIX system, .dll on Windows)
          given one or more object files or C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files. If any source files are given, then they will be
          automatically compiled to object files. The target library file
          prefix, specified by the [1054]$SHLIBPREFIX construction
          variable (by default, lib on POSIX systems, nothing on Windows
          systems), and suffix, specified by the [1055]$SHLIBSUFFIX
          construction variable (by default, .dll on Windows systems, .so
          on POSIX systems), are automatically added to the target if not
          already present. Example:

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          On Windows systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always
          build an import library (.lib) in addition to the shared library
          (.dll), adding a .lib library with the same basename if there is
          not already a .lib file explicitly listed in the targets.

          On Cygwin systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always
          build an import library (.dll.a) in addition to the shared
          library (.dll), adding a .dll.a library with the same basename
          if there is not already a .dll.a file explicitly listed in the
          targets.

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          shared library (that is, using the SharedObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

          On some platforms, there is a distinction between a shared
          library (loaded automatically by the system to resolve external
          references) and a loadable module (explicitly loaded by user
          action). For maximum portability, use the [1056]LoadableModule
          builder for the latter.

          When the [1057]$SHLIBVERSION construction variable is defined, a
          versioned shared library is created. This modifies
          [1058]$SHLINKFLAGS as required, adds the version number to the
          library name, and creates any symbolic links that are needed.

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'], SHLIBVERSION='1.5.2')

          On a POSIX system, versions with a single token create exactly
          one symlink: libbar.so.6 would have symlink libbar.so only. On a
          POSIX system, versions with two or more tokens create exactly
          two symlinks: libbar.so.2.3.1 would have symlinks libbar.so and
          libbar.so.2; on a Darwin (OSX) system the library would be
          libbar.2.3.1.dylib and the link would be libbar.dylib.

          On Windows systems, specifying register=1 will cause the .dll to
          be registered after it is built. The command that is run is
          determined by the [1059]$REGSVR construction variable (regsvr32
          by default), and the flags passed are determined by
          [1060]$REGSVRFLAGS. By default, [1061]$REGSVRFLAGS includes the
          /s option, to prevent dialogs from popping up and requiring user
          attention when it is run. If you change [1062]$REGSVRFLAGS, be
          sure to include the /s option. For example,

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.cxx', 'foo.obj'], register=1)

          will register bar.dll as a COM object when it is done linking
          it.

   SharedObject()
          env.SharedObject()
          Builds an object file intended for inclusion in a shared
          library. Source files must have one of the same set of
          extensions specified above for the StaticObject builder method.
          On some platforms building a shared object requires additional
          compiler option (e.g. -fPIC for gcc) in addition to those needed
          to build a normal (static) object, but on some platforms there
          is no difference between a shared object and a normal (static)
          one. When there is a difference, SCons will only allow shared
          objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use a
          different suffix for shared objects. On platforms where there is
          no difference, SCons will allow both normal (static) and shared
          objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use the
          same suffix for shared and normal (static) objects. The target
          object file prefix, specified by the [1063]$SHOBJPREFIX
          construction variable (by default, the same as
          [1064]$OBJPREFIX), and suffix, specified by the
          [1065]$SHOBJSUFFIX construction variable, are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Examples:

env.SharedObject(target='ddd', source='ddd.c')
env.SharedObject(target='eee.o', source='eee.cpp')
env.SharedObject(target='fff.obj', source='fff.for')

          Note that the source files will be scanned according to the
          suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner object. See the section
          "Scanner Objects," below, for more information.

   StaticLibrary()
          env.StaticLibrary()
          Builds a static library given one or more object files or C,
          C++, D or Fortran source files. If any source files are given,
          then they will be automatically compiled to object files. The
          static library file prefix, specified by the [1066]$LIBPREFIX
          construction variable (by default, lib on POSIX systems, nothing
          on Windows systems), and suffix, specified by the
          [1067]$LIBSUFFIX construction variable (by default, .lib on
          Windows systems, .a on POSIX systems), are automatically added
          to the target if not already present. Example:

env.StaticLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          static library (that is, using the StaticObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

   StaticObject()
          env.StaticObject()
          Builds a static object file from one or more C, C++, D, or
          Fortran source files. Source files must have one of the
          following extensions:

  .asm    assembly language file
  .ASM    assembly language file
  .c      C file
  .C      Windows:  C file
          POSIX:  C++ file
  .cc     C++ file
  .cpp    C++ file
  .cxx    C++ file
  .cxx    C++ file
  .c++    C++ file
  .C++    C++ file
  .d      D file
  .f      Fortran file
  .F      Windows:  Fortran file
          POSIX:  Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .for    Fortran file
  .FOR    Fortran file
  .fpp    Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .FPP    Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .m      Object C file
  .mm     Object C++ file
  .s      assembly language file
  .S      Windows:  assembly language file
          ARM: CodeSourcery Sourcery Lite
  .sx     assembly language file + C pre-processor
          POSIX:  assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .spp    assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .SPP    assembly language file + C pre-processor

          The target object file prefix, specified by the [1068]$OBJPREFIX
          construction variable (nothing by default), and suffix,
          specified by the [1069]$OBJSUFFIX construction variable (.obj on
          Windows systems, .o on POSIX systems), are automatically added
          to the target if not already present. Examples:

env.StaticObject(target='aaa', source='aaa.c')
env.StaticObject(target='bbb.o', source='bbb.c++')
env.StaticObject(target='ccc.obj', source='ccc.f')

          Note that the source files will be scanned according to the
          suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner object. See the section
          "Scanner Objects," below, for more information.

   Substfile()
          env.Substfile()
          The Substfile builder creates a single text file from a template
          consisting of a file or set of files (or nodes), replacing text
          using the [1070]$SUBST_DICT construction variable (if set). If a
          set, they are concatenated into the target file using the value
          of the [1071]$LINESEPARATOR construction variable as a separator
          between contents; the separator is not emitted after the
          contents of the last file. Nested lists of source files are
          flattened. See also [1072]Textfile.

          If a single source file name is specified and has a .in suffix,
          the suffix is stripped and the remainder of the name is used as
          the default target name.

          The prefix and suffix specified by the [1073]$SUBSTFILEPREFIX
          and [1074]$SUBSTFILESUFFIX construction variables (an empty
          string by default in both cases) are automatically added to the
          target if they are not already present.

          If a construction variable named [1075]$SUBST_DICT is present,
          it may be either a Python dictionary or a sequence of (key,
          value) tuples. If it is a dictionary it is converted into a list
          of tuples with unspecified order, so if one key is a prefix of
          another key or if one substitution could be further expanded by
          another subsitition, it is unpredictable whether the expansion
          will occur.

          Any occurrences of a key in the source are replaced by the
          corresponding value, which may be a Python callable function or
          a string. If the value is a callable, it is called with no
          arguments to get a string. Strings are subst-expanded and the
          result replaces the key.

env = Environment(tools=['default'])

env['prefix'] = '/usr/bin'
script_dict = {'@prefix@': '/bin', '@exec_prefix@': '$prefix'}
env.Substfile('script.in', SUBST_DICT=script_dict)

conf_dict = {'%VERSION%': '1.2.3', '%BASE%': 'MyProg'}
env.Substfile('config.h.in', conf_dict, SUBST_DICT=conf_dict)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one key is a prefix of another
bad_foo = {'$foo': '$foo', '$foobar': '$foobar'}
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT=bad_foo)

# PREDICTABLE - keys are applied longest first
good_foo = [('$foobar', '$foobar'), ('$foo', '$foo')]
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT=good_foo)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one substitution could be futher expanded
bad_bar = {'@bar@': '@soap@', '@soap@': 'lye'}
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT=bad_bar)

# PREDICTABLE - substitutions are expanded in order
good_bar = (('@bar@', '@soap@'), ('@soap@', 'lye'))

    'pgm2.c',
    [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'), Value('#include "@bar@.h"'), "common.in", "pgm

)


   Tar()
          env.Tar()
          Builds a tar archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Tar builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Tar('src.tar', 'src')

# Create the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', 'another')

# Set TARFLAGS to create a gzip-filtered archive.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z')
env.Tar('foo.tar.gz', 'foo')

# Also set the suffix to .tgz.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z',
                  TARSUFFIX = '.tgz')
env.Tar('foo')

   Textfile()
          env.Textfile()
          The Textfile builder generates a single text file from a
          template consisting of a list of strings, replacing text using
          the [1076]$SUBST_DICT construction variable (if set) - see
          [1077]Substfile for a description of replacement. The strings
          will be separated in the target file using the value of the
          [1078]$LINESEPARATOR construction variable; the line separator
          is not emitted after the last string. Nested lists of source
          strings are flattened. Source strings need not literally be
          Python strings: they can be Nodes or Python objects that convert
          cleanly to [1079]Value nodes

          The prefix and suffix specified by the [1080]$TEXTFILEPREFIX and
          [1081]$TEXTFILESUFFIX construction variables (by default an
          empty string and .txt, respectively) are automatically added to
          the target if they are not already present. Examples:

# builds/writes foo.txt
env.Textfile(target='foo.txt', source=['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'])

# builds/writes bar.txt
env.Textfile(target='bar', source=['lalala', 'tanteratei'], LINESEPARATOR='|*')

# nested lists are flattened automatically
env.Textfile(target='blob', source=['lalala', ['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'], 'tante
ratei'])

# files may be used as input by wraping them in File()
env.Textfile(
    target='concat',  # concatenate files with a marker between
    source=[File('concat1'), File('concat2')],
    LINESEPARATOR='====================\n',
)

          Results:

          foo.txt

  Goethe
  42
  Schiller

          bar.txt

  lalala|*tanteratei

          blob.txt

  lalala
  Goethe
  42
  Schiller
  tanteratei

   Translate()
          env.Translate()
          This pseudo-builder belongs to [1082]gettext toolset. The
          builder extracts internationalized messages from source files,
          updates POT template (if necessary) and then updates PO
          translations (if necessary). If [1083]$POAUTOINIT is set,
          missing PO files will be automatically created (i.e. without
          translator person intervention). The variables
          [1084]$LINGUAS_FILE and [1085]$POTDOMAIN are taken into acount
          too. All other construction variables used by [1086]POTUpdate,
          and [1087]POUpdate work here too.

          Example 1. The simplest way is to specify input files and output
          languages inline in a SCons script when invoking Translate

# SConscript in 'po/' directory
env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
env.Translate(['en','pl'], ['../a.cpp','../b.cpp'])

          Example 2. If you wish, you may also stick to conventional style
          known from autotools, i.e. using POTFILES.in and LINGUAS files

# LINGUAS
en pl
#end

# POTFILES.in
a.cpp
b.cpp
# end

# SConscript
env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
env['XGETTEXTPATH'] = ['../']
env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in')

          The last approach is perhaps the recommended one. It allows
          easily split internationalization/localization onto separate
          SCons scripts, where a script in source tree is responsible for
          translations (from sources to PO files) and script(s) under
          variant directories are responsible for compilation of PO to MO
          files to and for installation of MO files. The "gluing factor"
          synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of LINGUAS
          file. Note, that the updated POT and PO files are usually going
          to be committed back to the repository, so they must be updated
          within the source directory (and not in variant directories).
          Additionaly, the file listing of po/ directory contains LINGUAS
          file, so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they
          may work with the project in their usual way.

          Example 3. Let's prepare a development tree as below

 project/
  + SConstruct
  + build/
  + src/
      + po/
          + SConscript
          + SConscript.i18n
          + POTFILES.in
          + LINGUAS

          with build being variant directory. Write the top-level
          SConstruct script as follows

  # SConstruct
  env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
  VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate = 0)
  env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
  SConscript('src/po/SConscript.i18n', exports = 'env')
  SConscript('build/po/SConscript', exports = 'env')

          the src/po/SConscript.i18n as

  # src/po/SConscript.i18n
  Import('env')
  env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE=1, XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../']
)

          and the src/po/SConscript

  # src/po/SConscript
  Import('env')
  env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Such setup produces POT and PO files under source tree in
          src/po/ and binary MO files under variant tree in build/po/.
          This way the POT and PO files are separated from other output
          files, which must not be committed back to source repositories
          (e.g. MO files).

Note

          In above example, the PO files are not updated, nor created
          automatically when you issue scons '.' command. The files must
          be updated (created) by hand via scons po-update and then MO
          files can be compiled by running scons '.'.

   TypeLibrary()
          env.TypeLibrary()
          Builds a Windows type library (.tlb) file from an input IDL file
          (.idl). In addition, it will build the associated interface stub
          and proxy source files, naming them according to the base name
          of the .idl file. For example,

env.TypeLibrary(source="foo.idl")

          Will create foo.tlb, foo.h, foo_i.c, foo_p.c and foo_data.c
          files.

   Uic()
          env.Uic()
          Builds a header file, an implementation file and a moc file from
          an ui file. and returns the corresponding nodes in the above
          order. This builder is only available after using the tool 'qt'.
          Note: you can specify .ui files directly as source files to the
          Program, Library and SharedLibrary builders without using this
          builder. Using this builder lets you override the standard
          naming conventions (be careful: prefixes are always prepended to
          names of built files; if you don't want prefixes, you may set
          them to ``). See the [1088]$QTDIR variable for more information.
          Example:

env.Uic('foo.ui') # -> ['foo.h', 'uic_foo.cc', 'moc_foo.cc']
env.Uic(target = Split('include/foo.h gen/uicfoo.cc gen/mocfoo.cc'),
        source = 'foo.ui') # -> ['include/foo.h', 'gen/uicfoo.cc', 'gen/mocfoo.c
c']

   Zip()
          env.Zip()
          Builds a zip archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Zip builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Zip('src.zip', 'src')

# Create the stuff.zip file.
env.Zip('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Zip('stuff', 'another')

   All targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources.
   An explicit dependency can be specified using the [1089]env.Depends
   method of a construction environment (see below).

   In addition, scons automatically scans source files for various
   programming languages, so the dependencies do not need to be specified
   explicitly. By default, SCons can C source files, C++ source files,
   Fortran source files with .F (POSIX systems only), .fpp, or .FPP file
   extensions, and assembly language files with .S (POSIX systems only),
   .spp, or .SPP files extensions for C preprocessor dependencies. SCons
   also has default support for scanning D source files, You can also
   write your own Scanners to add support for additional source file
   types. These can be added to the default Scanner object used by the
   [1090]Object, [1091]StaticObject and [1092]SharedObject Builders by
   adding them to the SourceFileScanner object. See [1093]the section
   called "Scanner Objects" for more information about defining your own
   Scanner objects and using the SourceFileScanner object.

Methods and Functions To Do Things

   In addition to Builder methods, scons provides a number of other
   construction environment methods and global functions to manipulate the
   build configuration.

   Usually, a construction environment method and global function with the
   same name both exist for convenience. In the following list, the global
   function is documented in this style:
Function(arguments, [optional arguments])

   and the construction environment method looks like:
env.Function(arguments, [optional arguments])

   If the function can be called both ways, then both forms are listed.

   The global function and same-named construction environment method
   provide almost identical functionality, with a couple of exceptions.
   First, many of the construction environment methods affect only that
   construction environment, while the global function has a global
   effect. Second, where appropriate, calling the functionality through a
   construction environment will substitute construction variables into
   any supplied string arguments, while the global function doesn't have
   the context of a construction environment to pick variables from, so it
   cannot perform the substitution. For example:
Default('$FOO')

env = Environment(FOO='foo')
env.Default('$FOO')

   In the above example, the call to the global Default function will add
   a target named $FOO to the list of default targets, while the call to
   the env.Default construction environment method will expand the value
   and add a target named foo to the list of default targets. For more on
   construction variable expansion, see the next section on construction
   variables.

   Global functions may be called from custom Python modules that you
   import into an SConscript file by adding the following import to the
   Python module:
from SCons.Script import *

   Construction environment methods and global functions provided by scons
   include:

   Action(action, [cmd/str/fun, [var, ...]] [option=value, ...])
          env.Action(action, [cmd/str/fun, [var, ...]] [option=value,
          ...])
          A factory function to create an Action object for the specified
          action. See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete
          explanation of the arguments and behavior.

          Note that the env.Action form of the invocation will expand
          construction variables in any argument strings, including the
          action argument, at the time it is called using the construction
          variables in the env construction environment through which
          env.Action was called. The Action global function form delays
          all variable expansion until the Action object is actually used.

   AddMethod(object, function, [name])
          env.AddMethod(function, [name])
          Adds function to an object as a method. function will be called
          with an instance object as the first argument as for other
          methods. If name is given, it is used as the name of the new
          method, else the name of function is used.

          When the global function AddMethod is called, the object to add
          the method to must be passed as the first argument; typically
          this will be Environment, in order to create a method which
          applies to all construction environments subsequently
          constructed. When called using the env.AddMethod form, the
          method is added to the specified construction environment only.
          Added methods propagate through env.Clone calls.

          Examples:

# Function to add must accept an instance argument.
# The Python convention is to call this 'self'.
def my_method(self, arg):
    print("my_method() got", arg)

# Use the global function to add a method to the Environment class:
AddMethod(Environment, my_method)
env = Environment()
env.my_method('arg')

# Use the optional name argument to set the name of the method:
env.AddMethod(my_method, 'other_method_name')
env.other_method_name('another arg')

   AddOption(arguments)
          Adds a local (project-specific) command-line option. arguments
          are the same as those supported by the add_option method in the
          standard Python library module optparse, with a few additional
          capabilities noted below. See the documentation for optparse for
          a thorough discussion of its option-processing capabities.

          In addition to the arguments and values supported by the
          optparse add_option method, AddOption allows setting the nargs
          keyword value to a string consisting of a question mark ('?') to
          indicate that the option argument for that option string is
          optional. If the option string is present on the command line
          but has no matching option argument, the value of the const
          keyword argument is produced as the value of the option. If the
          option string is omitted from the command line, the value of the
          default keyword argument is produced, as usual; if there is no
          default keyword argument in the AddOption call, None is
          produced.

          optparse recognizes abbreviations of long option names, as long
          as they can be unambiguously resolved. For example, if
          add_option is called to define a --devicename option, it will
          recognize --device, --dev and so forth as long as there is no
          other option which could also match to the same abbreviation.
          Options added via AddOption do not support the automatic
          recognition of abbreviations. Instead, to allow specific
          abbreviations, include them as synonyms in the AddOption call
          itself.

          Once a new command-line option has been added with AddOption,
          the option value may be accessed using [1094]GetOption or
          [1095]env.GetOption. [1096]SetOption is not currently supported
          for options added with AddOption.

          Help text for an option is a combination of the string supplied
          in the help keyword argument to AddOption and information
          collected from the other keyword arguments. Such help is
          displayed if the -h command line option is used (but not with
          -H). Help for all local options is displayed under the separate
          heading Local Options. The options are unsorted - they will
          appear in the help text in the order in which the AddOption
          calls occur.

          Example:

AddOption(
    '--prefix',
    dest='prefix',
    nargs=1,
    type='string',
    action='store',
    metavar='DIR',
    help='installation prefix',
)
env = Environment(PREFIX=GetOption('prefix'))

          For that example, the following help text would be produced:

Local Options:
  --prefix=DIR                installation prefix

          Help text for local options may be unavailable if the [1097]Help
          function has been called, see the Help documentation for
          details.

Note

          As an artifact of the internal implementation, the behavior of
          options added by AddOption which take option arguments is
          undefined if whitespace (rather than an = sign) is used as the
          separator on the command line. Users should avoid such usage; it
          is recommended to add a note to this effect to project
          documentation if the situation is likely to arise. In addition,
          if the nargs keyword is used to specify more than one following
          option argument (that is, with a value of 2 or greater), such
          arguments would necessarily be whitespace separated, triggering
          the issue. Developers should not use AddOption this way. Future
          versions of SCons will likely forbid such usage.

   AddPostAction(target, action)
          env.AddPostAction(target, action)
          Arranges for the specified action to be performed after the
          specified target has been built. The specified action(s) may be
          an Action object, or anything that can be converted into an
          Action object See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a
          complete explanation.

          When multiple targets are supplied, the action may be called
          multiple times, once after each action that generates one or
          more targets in the list.

   AddPreAction(target, action)
          env.AddPreAction(target, action)
          Arranges for the specified action to be performed before the
          specified target is built. The specified action(s) may be an
          Action object, or anything that can be converted into an Action
          object See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete
          explanation.

          When multiple targets are specified, the action(s) may be called
          multiple times, once before each action that generates one or
          more targets in the list.

          Note that if any of the targets are built in multiple steps, the
          action will be invoked just before the "final" action that
          specifically generates the specified target(s). For example,
          when building an executable program from a specified source .c
          file via an intermediate object file:

foo = Program('foo.c')
AddPreAction(foo, 'pre_action')

          The specified pre_action would be executed before scons calls
          the link command that actually generates the executable program
          binary foo, not before compiling the foo.c file into an object
          file.

   Alias(alias, [targets, [action]])
          env.Alias(alias, [targets, [action]])
          Creates one or more phony targets that expand to one or more
          other targets. An optional action (command) or list of actions
          can be specified that will be executed whenever the any of the
          alias targets are out-of-date. Returns the Node object
          representing the alias, which exists outside of any file system.
          This Node object, or the alias name, may be used as a dependency
          of any other target, including another alias. Alias can be
          called multiple times for the same alias to add additional
          targets to the alias, or additional actions to the list for this
          alias. Aliases are global even if set through the construction
          environment method.

          Examples:

Alias('install')
Alias('install', '/usr/bin')
Alias(['install', 'install-lib'], '/usr/local/lib')

env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/lib'])
env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/man'])

env.Alias('update', ['file1', 'file2'], "update_database $SOURCES")

   AllowSubstExceptions([exception, ...])
          Specifies the exceptions that will be allowed when expanding
          construction variables. By default, any construction variable
          expansions that generate a NameError or IndexError exception
          will expand to a '' (an empty string) and not cause scons to
          fail. All exceptions not in the specified list will generate an
          error message and terminate processing.

          If AllowSubstExceptions is called multiple times, each call
          completely overwrites the previous list of allowed exceptions.

          Example:

# Requires that all construction variable names exist.
# (You may wish to do this if you want to enforce strictly
# that all construction variables must be defined before use.)
AllowSubstExceptions()

# Also allow a string containing a zero-division expansion
# like '${1 / 0}' to evalute to ''.
AllowSubstExceptions(IndexError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError)

   AlwaysBuild(target, ...)
          env.AlwaysBuild(target, ...)
          Marks each given target so that it is always assumed to be out
          of date, and will always be rebuilt if needed. Note, however,
          that AlwaysBuild does not add its target(s) to the default
          target list, so the targets will only be built if they are
          specified on the command line, or are a dependent of a target
          specified on the command line--but they will always be built if
          so specified. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call
          to AlwaysBuild.

   env.Append(key=val, [...])
          Appends the specified keyword arguments to the end of
          construction variables in the environment. If the Environment
          does not have the specified construction variable, it is simply
          added to the environment. If the values of the construction
          variable and the keyword argument are the same type, then the
          two values will be simply added together. Otherwise, the
          construction variable and the value of the keyword argument are
          both coerced to lists, and the lists are added together. (See
          also the Prepend method).

          Example:

env.Append(CCFLAGS = ' -g', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

   env.AppendENVPath(name, newpath, [envname, sep, delete_existing])
          This appends new path elements to the given path in the
          specified external environment (ENV by default). This will only
          add any particular path once (leaving the last one it encounters
          and ignoring the rest, to preserve path order), and to help
          assure this, will normalize all paths (using os.path.normpath
          and os.path.normcase). This can also handle the case where the
          given old path variable is a list instead of a string, in which
          case a list will be returned instead of a string.

          If delete_existing is 0, then adding a path that already exists
          will not move it to the end; it will stay where it is in the
          list.

          Example:

print 'before:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.AppendENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print 'after:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']

yields:
before: /foo:/biz
after: /biz:/foo/bar:/foo

   env.AppendUnique(key=val, [...], delete_existing=0)
          Appends the specified keyword arguments to the end of
          construction variables in the environment. If the Environment
          does not have the specified construction variable, it is simply
          added to the environment. If the construction variable being
          appended to is a list, then any value(s) that already exist in
          the construction variable will not be added again to the list.
          However, if delete_existing is 1, existing matching values are
          removed first, so existing values in the arg list move to the
          end of the list.

          Example:

env.AppendUnique(CCFLAGS = '-g', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

   Builder(action, [arguments])
          env.Builder(action, [arguments])
          Creates a Builder object for the specified action. See the
          manpage section "Builder Objects" for a complete explanation of
          the arguments and behavior.

          Note that the env.Builder() form of the invocation will expand
          construction variables in any arguments strings, including the
          action argument, at the time it is called using the construction
          variables in the env construction environment through which
          env.Builder was called. The Builder form delays all variable
          expansion until after the Builder object is actually called.

   CacheDir(cache_dir)
          env.CacheDir(cache_dir)
          Direct scons to maintain a derived-file cache in cache_dir. The
          derived files in the cache will be shared among all the builds
          specifying the same cache_dir. Specifying a cache_dir of None
          disables derived file caching.

          Calling the environment method [1098]env.CacheDir limits the
          effect to targets built through the specified construction
          environment. Calling the global function [1099]CacheDir sets a
          global default that will be used by all targets built through
          construction environments that do not set up
          environment-specific caching by calling env.CacheDir.

          When derived-file caching is being used and scons finds a
          derived file that needs to be rebuilt, it will first look in the
          cache to see if a file with matching build signature exists
          (indicating the input file(s) and build action(s) were identical
          to those for the current target), and if so, will retrieve the
          file from the cache. scons will report Retrieved `file' from
          cache instead of the normal build message. If the derived file
          is not present in the cache, scons will build it and then place
          a copy of the built file in the cache, identified by its build
          signature, for future use.

          The Retrieved `file' from cache messages are useful for human
          consumption, but less so when comparing log files between scons
          runs which will show differences that are noisy and not actually
          significant. To disable, use the --cache-show option. With this
          option, scons will print the action that would have been used to
          build the file without considering cache retrieval.

          Derived-file caching may be disabled for any invocation of scons
          by giving the --cache-disable command line option. Cache
          updating may be disabled, leaving cache fetching enabled, by
          giving the --cache-readonly.

          If the --cache-force option is used, scons will place a copy of
          all derived files in the cache, even if they already existed and
          were not built by this invocation. This is useful to populate a
          cache the first time a cache_dir is used for a build, or to
          bring a cache up to date after a build with cache updating
          disabled (--cache-disable or --cache-readonly) has been done.

          The [1100]NoCache method can be used to disable caching of
          specific files. This can be useful if inputs and/or outputs of
          some tool are impossible to predict or prohibitively large.

   Clean(targets, files_or_dirs)
          env.Clean(targets, files_or_dirs)
          This specifies a list of files or directories which should be
          removed whenever the targets are specified with the -c command
          line option. The specified targets may be a list or an
          individual target. Multiple calls to Clean are legal, and create
          new targets or add files and directories to the clean list for
          the specified targets.

          Multiple files or directories should be specified either as
          separate arguments to the Clean method, or as a list. Clean will
          also accept the return value of any of the construction
          environment Builder methods. Examples:

          The related [1101]NoClean function overrides calling Clean for
          the same target, and any targets passed to both functions will
          not be removed by the -c option.

          Examples:

Clean('foo', ['bar', 'baz'])
Clean('dist', env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))
Clean(['foo', 'bar'], 'something_else_to_clean')

          In this example, installing the project creates a subdirectory
          for the documentation. This statement causes the subdirectory to
          be removed if the project is deinstalled.

Clean(docdir, os.path.join(docdir, projectname))

   env.Clone([key=val, ...])
          Returns a separate copy of a construction environment. If there
          are any keyword arguments specified, they are added to the
          returned copy, overwriting any existing values for the keywords.

          Example:

env2 = env.Clone()
env3 = env.Clone(CCFLAGS = '-g')

          Additionally, a list of tools and a toolpath may be specified,
          as in the [1102]Environment constructor:

def MyTool(env): env['FOO'] = 'bar'
env4 = env.Clone(tools = ['msvc', MyTool])

          The parse_flags keyword argument is also recognized to allow
          merging command-line style arguments into the appropriate
          construction variables (see [1103]env.MergeFlags).

# create an environment for compiling programs that use wxWidgets
wx_env = env.Clone(parse_flags='!wx-config --cflags --cxxflags')

   Command(target, source, action, [key=val, ...])
          env.Command(target, source, action, [key=val, ...])
          Executes a specific action (or list of actions) to build a
          target file or files from a source file or files. This is more
          convenient than defining a separate Builder object for a single
          special-case build.

          The Command function accepts source_scanner, target_scanner,
          source_factory, and target_factory keyword arguments. These
          arguments can be used to specify a Scanner object that will be
          used to apply a custom scanner for a source or target. For
          example, the global DirScanner object can be used if any of the
          sources will be directories that must be scanned on-disk for
          changes to files that aren't already specified in other Builder
          of function calls. The *_factory arguments take a factory
          function that Command will use to turn any sources or targets
          specified as strings into SCons Nodes. See the manpage section
          "Builder Objects" for more information about how these arguments
          work in a Builder.

          Any other keyword arguments specified override any same-named
          existing construction variables.

          An action can be an external command, specified as a string, or
          a callable Python object; see the manpage section "Action
          Objects" for more complete information. Also note that a string
          specifying an external command may be preceded by an at-sign (@)
          to suppress printing the command in question, or by a hyphen (-)
          to ignore the exit status of the external command.

          Examples:

env.Command(
    target='foo.out',
    source='foo.in',
    action="$FOO_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET"
)

env.Command(
    target='bar.out',
    source='bar.in',
    action=["rm -f $TARGET", "$BAR_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET"],
    ENV={'PATH': '/usr/local/bin/'},
)


import os
def rename(env, target, source):
    os.rename('.tmp', str(target[0]))


env.Command(
    target='baz.out',
    source='baz.in',
    action=["$BAZ_BUILD < $SOURCES > .tmp", rename],
)

          Note that the Command function will usually assume, by default,
          that the specified targets and/or sources are Files, if no other
          part of the configuration identifies what type of entries they
          are. If necessary, you can explicitly specify that targets or
          source nodes should be treated as directories by using the
          [1104]Dir or [1105]env.Dir functions.

          Examples:

env.Command('ddd.list', Dir('ddd'), 'ls -l $SOURCE > $TARGET')

env['DISTDIR'] = 'destination/directory'
env.Command(env.Dir('$DISTDIR')), None, make_distdir)

          Also note that SCons will usually automatically create any
          directory necessary to hold a target file, so you normally don't
          need to create directories by hand.

   Configure(env, [custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h])
          env.Configure([custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h])
          Creates a Configure object for integrated functionality similar
          to GNU autoconf. See the manpage section "Configure Contexts"
          for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

   Decider(function)
          env.Decider(function)
          Specifies that all up-to-date decisions for targets built
          through this construction environment will be handled by the
          specified function. function can be the name of a function or
          one of the following strings that specify the predefined
          decision function that will be applied:

        "timestamp-newer"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp is newer than
                the target file's timestamp. This is the behavior of the
                classic Make utility, and make can be used a synonym for
                timestamp-newer.

        "timestamp-match"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp is different
                than the timestamp recorded the last time the target was
                built. This provides behavior very similar to the classic
                Make utility (in particular, files are not opened up so
                that their contents can be checksummed) except that the
                target will also be rebuilt if a dependency file has been
                restored to a version with an earlier timestamp, such as
                can happen when restoring files from backup archives.

        "MD5"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's content has changed since
                the last time the target was built, as determined be
                performing an MD5 checksum on the dependency's contents
                and comparing it to the checksum recorded the last time
                the target was built. content can be used as a synonym for
                MD5.

        "MD5-timestamp"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's content has changed since
                the last time the target was built, except that
                dependencies with a timestamp that matches the last time
                the target was rebuilt will be assumed to be up-to-date
                and not rebuilt. This provides behavior very similar to
                the MD5 behavior of always checksumming file contents,
                with an optimization of not checking the contents of files
                whose timestamps haven't changed. The drawback is that
                SCons will not detect if a file's content has changed but
                its timestamp is the same, as might happen in an automated
                script that runs a build, updates a file, and runs the
                build again, all within a single second.

          Examples:

# Use exact timestamp matches by default.
Decider('timestamp-match')

# Use MD5 content signatures for any targets built
# with the attached construction environment.
env.Decider('content')

          In addition to the above already-available functions, the
          function argument may be a Python function you supply. Such a
          function must accept the following four arguments:

        dependency
                The Node (file) which should cause the target to be
                rebuilt if it has "changed" since the last tme target was
                built.

        target
                The Node (file) being built. In the normal case, this is
                what should get rebuilt if the dependency has "changed."

        prev_ni
                Stored information about the state of the dependency the
                last time the target was built. This can be consulted to
                match various file characteristics such as the timestamp,
                size, or content signature.

        repo_node
                If set, use this Node instead of the one specified by
                dependency to determine if the dependency has changed.
                This argument is optional so should be written as a
                default argument (typically it would be written as
                repo_node=None). A caller will normally only set this if
                the target only exists in a Repository.

          The function should return a value which evaluates True if the
          dependency has "changed" since the last time the target was
          built (indicating that the target should be rebuilt), and a
          value which evaluates False otherwise (indicating that the
          target should not be rebuilt). Note that the decision can be
          made using whatever criteria are appopriate. Ignoring some or
          all of the function arguments is perfectly normal.

          Example:

def my_decider(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
    return not os.path.exists(str(target))

env.Decider(my_decider)

   Default(targets...)
          env.Default(targets...)
          This specifies a list of default targets, which will be built by
          scons if no explicit targets are given on the command line.
          Multiple calls to Default are legal, and add to the list of
          default targets. As noted above, both forms of this call affect
          the same global list of default targets; the construction
          environment method applies construction variable expansion to
          the targets.

          Multiple targets should be specified as separate arguments to
          the Default method, or as a list. Default will also accept the
          Node returned by any of a construction environment's builder
          methods.

          Examples:

Default('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
env.Default(['a', 'b', 'c'])
hello = env.Program('hello', 'hello.c')
env.Default(hello)

          An argument to Default of None will clear all default targets.
          Later calls to Default will add to the (now empty)
          default-target list like normal.

          The current list of targets added using the Default function or
          method is available in the DEFAULT_TARGETS list; see below.

   DefaultEnvironment([**kwargs])
          Instantiates and returns the default construction environment
          object. The default environment is used internally by SCons in
          order to execute many of the global functions in this list (that
          is, those not called as methods of a specific construction
          environment). It is not mandatory to call DefaultEnvironment:
          the default environment will be instantiated automatically when
          the build phase begins if the function has not been called,
          however calling it explicitly gives the opportunity to affect
          and examine the contents of the default environment.

          The default environment is a singleton, so the keyword arguments
          affect it only on the first call, on subsequent calls the
          already-constructed object is returned and any keyword arguments
          are silently ignored. The default environment can be modified
          after instantiation in the same way as any construction
          environment. Modifying the default environment has no effect on
          the construction environment constructed by an [1106]Environment
          or [1107]Clone call.

   Depends(target, dependency)
          env.Depends(target, dependency)
          Specifies an explicit dependency; the target will be rebuilt
          whenever the dependency has changed. Both the specified target
          and dependency can be a string (usually the path name of a file
          or directory) or Node objects, or a list of strings or Node
          objects (such as returned by a Builder call). This should only
          be necessary for cases where the dependency is not caught by a
          Scanner for the file.

          Example:

env.Depends('foo', 'other-input-file-for-foo')

mylib = env.Library('mylib.c')
installed_lib = env.Install('lib', mylib)
bar = env.Program('bar.c')

# Arrange for the library to be copied into the installation
# directory before trying to build the "bar" program.
# (Note that this is for example only.  A "real" library
# dependency would normally be configured through the $LIBS
# and $LIBPATH variables, not using an env.Depends() call.)

env.Depends(bar, installed_lib)

   env.Detect(progs)
          Find an executable from one or more choices: progs may be a
          string or a list of strings. Returns the first value from progs
          that was found, or None. Executable is searched by checking the
          paths specified by env['ENV']['PATH']. On Windows systems,
          additionally applies the filename suffixes found in
          env['ENV']['PATHEXT'] but will not include any such extension in
          the return value. env.Detect is a wrapper around
          [1108]env.WhereIs.

   env.Dictionary([vars])
          Returns a dictionary object containing the construction
          variables in the construction environment. If there are any
          arguments specified, the values of the specified construction
          variables are returned as a string (if one argument) or as a
          list of strings.

          Example:

cvars = env.Dictionary()
cc_values = env.Dictionary('CC', 'CCFLAGS', 'CCCOM')

   Dir(name, [directory])
          env.Dir(name, [directory])
          Returns Directory Node(s). A Directory Node is an object that
          represents a directory. name can be a relative or absolute path
          or a list of such paths. directory is an optional directory that
          will be used as the parent directory. If no directory is
          specified, the current script's directory is used as the parent.

          If name is a single pathname, the corresponding node is
          returned. If name is a list, SCons returns a list of nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in name.

          Directory Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string
          as a directory name to a Builder method or function. Directory
          Nodes have attributes and methods that are useful in many
          situations; see manpage section "File and Directory Nodes" for
          more information.

   env.Dump([key], [format])
          Serializes construction variables to a string. The method
          supports the following formats specified by format:

        pretty
                Returns a pretty printed representation of the environment
                (if format is not specified, this is the default).

        json
                Returns a JSON-formatted string representation of the
                environment.

          If key is None (the default) the entire dictionary of
          construction variables is serialized. If supplied, it is taken
          as the name of a construction variable whose value is
          serialized.

          This SConstruct:

env=Environment()
print(env.Dump('CCCOM'))

          will print:

'$CC -c -o $TARGET $CCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPDEFFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS $SOURCES'

          While this SConstruct:

env=Environment()
print(env.Dump())

          will print:

{ 'AR': 'ar',
  'ARCOM': '$AR $ARFLAGS $TARGET $SOURCES\n$RANLIB $RANLIBFLAGS $TARGET',
  'ARFLAGS': ['r'],
  'AS': 'as',
  'ASCOM': '$AS $ASFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCES',
  'ASFLAGS': [],
  ...

   EnsurePythonVersion(major, minor)
          env.EnsurePythonVersion(major, minor)
          Ensure that the Python version is at least major.minor. This
          function will print out an error message and exit SCons with a
          non-zero exit code if the actual Python version is not late
          enough.

          Example:

EnsurePythonVersion(2,2)

   EnsureSConsVersion(major, minor, [revision])
          env.EnsureSConsVersion(major, minor, [revision])
          Ensure that the SCons version is at least major.minor, or
          major.minor.revision. if revision is specified. This function
          will print out an error message and exit SCons with a non-zero
          exit code if the actual SCons version is not late enough.

          Examples:

EnsureSConsVersion(0,14)

EnsureSConsVersion(0,96,90)

   Environment([key=value, ...])
          env.Environment([key=value, ...])
          Return a new construction environment initialized with the
          specified key=value pairs. The keyword arguments parse_flags,
          platform, toolpath, tools and variables are also specially
          recognized. See the manpage section "Construction Environments"
          for more details.

   Execute(action, [strfunction, varlist])
          env.Execute(action, [strfunction, varlist])
          Executes an Action object. The specified action may be an Action
          object (see manpage section "Action Objects" for an explanation
          of behavior), or it may be a command-line string, list of
          commands, or executable Python function, each of which will be
          converted into an Action object and then executed. Any
          additional arguments to Execute (strfunction, varlist) are
          passed on to the [1109]Action factory function which actually
          creates the Action object. The exit value of the command or
          return value of the Python function will be returned.

          Note that scons will print an error message if the executed
          action fails--that is, exits with or returns a non-zero value.
          scons will not, however, automatically terminate the build if
          the specified action fails. If you want the build to stop in
          response to a failed Execute call, you must explicitly check for
          a non-zero return value:

Execute(Copy('file.out', 'file.in'))

if Execute("mkdir sub/dir/ectory"):
    # The mkdir failed, don't try to build.
    Exit(1)

   Exit([value])
          env.Exit([value])
          This tells scons to exit immediately with the specified value. A
          default exit value of 0 (zero) is used if no value is specified.

   Export([vars...], [key=value...])
          env.Export([vars...], [key=value...])
          Exports variables from the current SConscript file to a global
          collection where they can be imported by other SConscript files.
          vars may be one or more strings representing variable names to
          be exported. If a string contains whitespace, it is split into
          separate strings, as if multiple string arguments had been
          given. A vars argument may also be a dictionary, which can be
          used to map variables to different names when exported. Keyword
          arguments can be used to provide names and their values.

          Export calls are cumulative. Specifying a previously exported
          variable will overwrite the earlier value. Both local variables
          and global variables can be exported.

          Examples:

env = Environment()
# Make env available for all SConscript files to Import().
Export("env")

package = 'my_name'
# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:.
Export("env", "package")

# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:
Export(["env", "package"])

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export(debug=env)

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export({"debug": env})

          Note that the [1110]SConscript function supports an exports
          argument that allows exporting a variable or set of variables to
          a specific SConscript file or files. See the description below.

   File(name, [directory])
          env.File(name, [directory])
          Returns File Node(s). A File Node is an object that represents a
          file. name can be a relative or absolute path or a list of such
          paths. directory is an optional directory that will be used as
          the parent directory. If no directory is specified, the current
          script's directory is used as the parent.

          If name is a single pathname, the corresponding node is
          returned. If name is a list, SCons returns a list of nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in name.

          File Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string as a
          file name to a Builder method or function. File Nodes have
          attributes and methods that are useful in many situations; see
          manpage section "File and Directory Nodes" for more information.

   FindFile(file, dirs)
          env.FindFile(file, dirs)
          Search for file in the path specified by dirs. dirs may be a
          list of directory names or a single directory name. In addition
          to searching for files that exist in the filesystem, this
          function also searches for derived files that have not yet been
          built.

          Example:

foo = env.FindFile('foo', ['dir1', 'dir2'])

   FindInstalledFiles()
          env.FindInstalledFiles()
          Returns the list of targets set up by the [1111]Install or
          [1112]InstallAs builders.

          This function serves as a convenient method to select the
          contents of a binary package.

          Example:

Install( '/bin', [ 'executable_a', 'executable_b' ] )

# will return the file node list
# [ '/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b' ]
FindInstalledFiles()

Install( '/lib', [ 'some_library' ] )

# will return the file node list
# [ '/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b', '/lib/some_library' ]
FindInstalledFiles()

   FindPathDirs(variable)
          Returns a function (actually a callable Python object) intended
          to be used as the path_function of a Scanner object. The
          returned object will look up the specified variable in a
          construction environment and treat the construction variable's
          value as a list of directory paths that should be searched (like
          [1113]$CPPPATH, [1114]$LIBPATH, etc.).

          Note that use of FindPathDirs is generally preferable to writing
          your own path_function for the following reasons: 1) The
          returned list will contain all appropriate directories found in
          source trees (when [1115]VariantDir is used) or in code
          repositories (when Repository or the -Y option are used). 2)
          scons will identify expansions of variable that evaluate to the
          same list of directories as, in fact, the same list, and avoid
          re-scanning the directories for files, when possible.

          Example:

def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    # Code to scan file contents goes here...
    return include_files

scanner = Scanner(name = 'myscanner',
                  function = my_scan,
                  path_function = FindPathDirs('MYPATH'))

   FindSourceFiles(node='"."')
          env.FindSourceFiles(node='"."')
          Returns the list of nodes which serve as the source of the built
          files. It does so by inspecting the dependency tree starting at
          the optional argument node which defaults to the '"."'-node. It
          will then return all leaves of node. These are all children
          which have no further children.

          This function is a convenient method to select the contents of a
          Source Package.

          Example:

Program( 'src/main_a.c' )
Program( 'src/main_b.c' )
Program( 'main_c.c' )

# returns ['main_c.c', 'src/main_a.c', 'SConstruct', 'src/main_b.c']
FindSourceFiles()

# returns ['src/main_b.c', 'src/main_a.c' ]
FindSourceFiles( 'src' )

          As you can see build support files (SConstruct in the above
          example) will also be returned by this function.

   Flatten(sequence)
          env.Flatten(sequence)
          Takes a sequence (that is, a Python list or tuple) that may
          contain nested sequences and returns a flattened list containing
          all of the individual elements in any sequence. This can be
          helpful for collecting the lists returned by calls to Builders;
          other Builders will automatically flatten lists specified as
          input, but direct Python manipulation of these lists does not.

          Examples:

foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')

# Because `foo' and `bar' are lists returned by the Object() Builder,
# `objects' will be a list containing nested lists:
objects = ['f1.o', foo, 'f2.o', bar, 'f3.o']

# Passing such a list to another Builder is all right because
# the Builder will flatten the list automatically:
Program(source = objects)

# If you need to manipulate the list directly using Python, you need to
# call Flatten() yourself, or otherwise handle nested lists:
for object in Flatten(objects):
    print(str(object))

   GetBuildFailures()
          Returns a list of exceptions for the actions that failed while
          attempting to build targets. Each element in the returned list
          is a BuildError object with the following attributes that record
          various aspects of the build failure:

          .node The node that was being built when the build failure
          occurred.

          .status The numeric exit status returned by the command or
          Python function that failed when trying to build the specified
          Node.

          .errstr The SCons error string describing the build failure.
          (This is often a generic message like "Error 2" to indicate that
          an executed command exited with a status of 2.)

          .filename The name of the file or directory that actually caused
          the failure. This may be different from the .node attribute. For
          example, if an attempt to build a target named sub/dir/target
          fails because the sub/dir directory could not be created, then
          the .node attribute will be sub/dir/target but the .filename
          attribute will be sub/dir.

          .executor The SCons Executor object for the target Node being
          built. This can be used to retrieve the construction environment
          used for the failed action.

          .action The actual SCons Action object that failed. This will be
          one specific action out of the possible list of actions that
          would have been executed to build the target.

          .command The actual expanded command that was executed and
          failed, after expansion of [1116]$TARGET, [1117]$SOURCE, and
          other construction variables.

          Note that the GetBuildFailures function will always return an
          empty list until any build failure has occurred, which means
          that GetBuildFailures will always return an empty list while the
          SConscript files are being read. Its primary intended use is for
          functions that will be executed before SCons exits by passing
          them to the standard Python atexit.register() function. Example:

import atexit

def print_build_failures():
    from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
    for bf in GetBuildFailures():
        print("%s failed: %s" % (bf.node, bf.errstr))

atexit.register(print_build_failures)

   GetBuildPath(file, [...])
          env.GetBuildPath(file, [...])
          Returns the scons path name (or names) for the specified file
          (or files). The specified file or files may be scons Nodes or
          strings representing path names.

   GetLaunchDir()
          env.GetLaunchDir()
          Returns the absolute path name of the directory from which scons
          was initially invoked. This can be useful when using the -u, -U
          or -D options, which internally change to the directory in which
          the SConstruct file is found.

   GetOption(name)
          env.GetOption(name)
          This function provides a way to query the value of SCons options
          set on scons command line (or set using the [1118]SetOption
          function). The options supported are:

        cache_debug
                which corresponds to --cache-debug;

        cache_disable
                which corresponds to --cache-disable;

        cache_show
                which corresponds to --cache-show;

        clean
                which corresponds to -c, --clean and --remove;

        file
                which corresponds to -f, --file, --makefile and
                --sconstruct;

        help
                which corresponds to -h and --help;

        ignore_errors
                which corresponds to --ignore-errors;

        implicit_cache
                which corresponds to --implicit-cache;

        implicit_deps_changed
                which corresponds to --implicit-deps-changed;

        implicit_deps_unchanged
                which corresponds to --implicit-deps-unchanged;

        interactive
                which corresponds to --interact and --interactive;

        keep_going
                which corresponds to -k and --keep-going;

        question
                which corresponds to -q and --question;

        random
                which corresponds to --random;

        repository
                which corresponds to -Y, --repository and --srcdir;

        silent
                which corresponds to -s, --silent and --quiet;

        site_dir
                which corresponds to --site-dir;

        stack_size

                which corresponds to --taskmastertrace; and

        warn
                which corresponds to --warn and --warning.

          See the documentation for the corresponding command line option
          for information about each specific option.

   Glob(pattern, [ondisk, source, strings, exclude])
          env.Glob(pattern, [ondisk, source, strings, exclude])
          Returns Nodes (or strings) that match the specified pattern,
          relative to the directory of the current SConscript file. The
          evironment method form (env.Glob) performs string substition on
          pattern and returns whatever matches the resulting expanded
          pattern.

          The specified pattern uses Unix shell style metacharacters for
          matching:

  *       matches everything
  ?       matches any single character
  [seq]   matches any character in seq
  [!seq]  matches any char not in seq

          If the first character of a filename is a dot, it must be
          matched explicitly. Character matches do not span directory
          separators.

          The Glob knows about repositories (see the [1119]Repository
          function) and source directories (see the [1120]VariantDir
          function) and returns a Node (or string, if so configured) in
          the local (SConscript) directory if a matching Node is found
          anywhere in a corresponding repository or source directory.

          The ondisk argument may be set to a value which evaluates False
          to disable the search for matches on disk, thereby only
          returning matches among already-configured File or Dir Nodes.
          The default behavior is to return corresponding Nodes for any
          on-disk matches found.

          The source argument may be set to a value which evaluates True
          to specify that, when the local directory is a VariantDir, the
          returned Nodes should be from the corresponding source
          directory, not the local directory.

          The strings argument may be set to a value which evaluates True
          to have the Glob function return strings, not Nodes, that
          represent the matched files or directories. The returned strings
          will be relative to the local (SConscript) directory. (Note that
          This may make it easier to perform arbitrary manipulation of
          file names, but if the returned strings are passed to a
          different SConscript file, any Node translation will be relative
          to the other SConscript directory, not the original SConscript
          directory.)

          The exclude argument may be set to a pattern or a list of
          patterns (following the same Unix shell semantics) which must be
          filtered out of returned elements. Elements matching a least one
          pattern of this list will be excluded.

          Examples:

Program("foo", Glob("*.c"))
Zip("/tmp/everything", Glob(".??*") + Glob("*"))
sources = Glob("*.cpp", exclude=["os_*_specific_*.cpp"]) + \
          Glob( "os_%s_specific_*.cpp" % currentOS)

   Help(text, append=False)
          env.Help(text, append=False)
          Specifies a local help message to be printed if the -h argument
          is given to scons. Subsequent calls to Help append text to the
          previously defined local help text.

          For the first call to Help only, if append is False (the
          default) any local help message generated through
          [1121]AddOption calls is replaced. If append is True, text is
          appended to the existing help text.

   Ignore(target, dependency)
          env.Ignore(target, dependency)
          The specified dependency file(s) will be ignored when deciding
          if the target file(s) need to be rebuilt.

          You can also use Ignore to remove a target from the default
          build. In order to do this you must specify the directory the
          target will be built in as the target, and the file you want to
          skip building as the dependency.

          Note that this will only remove the dependencies listed from the
          files built by default. It will still be built if that
          dependency is needed by another object being built. See the
          third and forth examples below.

          Examples:

env.Ignore('foo', 'foo.c')
env.Ignore('bar', ['bar1.h', 'bar2.h'])
env.Ignore('.','foobar.obj')
env.Ignore('bar','bar/foobar.obj')

   Import(vars...)
          env.Import(vars...)
          Imports variables into the current SConscript file. vars must be
          strings representing names of variables which have been
          previously exported either by the [1122]Export function or by
          the exports argument to [1123]SConscript. Variables exported by
          SConscript take precedence. Multiple variable names can be
          passed to Import as separate arguments or as words in a
          space-separated string. The wildcard "*" can be used to import
          all available variables.

          Examples:

Import("env")
Import("env", "variable")
Import(["env", "variable"])
Import("*")

   Literal(string)
          env.Literal(string)
          The specified string will be preserved as-is and not have
          construction variables expanded.

   Local(targets)
          env.Local(targets)
          The specified targets will have copies made in the local tree,
          even if an already up-to-date copy exists in a repository.
          Returns a list of the target Node or Nodes.

   env.MergeFlags(arg, [unique])
          Merges the specified arg values to the construction
          environment's construction variables. If the arg argument is not
          a dictionary, it is converted to one by calling
          [1124]env.ParseFlags on the argument before the values are
          merged. Note that arg must be a single value, so multiple
          strings must be passed in as a list, not as separate arguments
          to env.MergeFlags.

          By default, duplicate values are eliminated; you can, however,
          specify unique=0 to allow duplicate values to be added. When
          eliminating duplicate values, any construction variables that
          end with the string PATH keep the left-most unique value. All
          other construction variables keep the right-most unique value.

          Examples:

# Add an optimization flag to $CCFLAGS.
env.MergeFlags('-O3')

# Combine the flags returned from running pkg-config with an optimization
# flag and merge the result into the construction variables.
env.MergeFlags(['!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags', '-O3'])

# Combine an optimization flag with the flags returned from running pkg-config
# twice and merge the result into the construction variables.
env.MergeFlags(['-O3',
               '!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags --libs',
               '!pkg-config libpng12 --cflags --libs'])

   NoCache(target, ...)
          env.NoCache(target, ...)
          Specifies a list of files which should not be cached whenever
          the [1125]CacheDir method has been activated. The specified
          targets may be a list or an individual target.

          Multiple files should be specified either as separate arguments
          to the NoCache method, or as a list. NoCache will also accept
          the return value of any of the construction environment Builder
          methods.

          Calling NoCache on directories and other non-File Node types has
          no effect because only File Nodes are cached.

          Examples:

NoCache('foo.elf')
NoCache(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

   NoClean(target, ...)
          env.NoClean(target, ...)
          Specifies a list of files or directories which should not be
          removed whenever the targets (or their dependencies) are
          specified with the -c command line option. The specified targets
          may be a list or an individual target. Multiple calls to NoClean
          are legal, and prevent each specified target from being removed
          by calls to the -c option.

          Multiple files or directories should be specified either as
          separate arguments to the NoClean method, or as a list. NoClean
          will also accept the return value of any of the construction
          environment Builder methods.

          Calling NoClean for a target overrides calling [1126]Clean for
          the same target, and any targets passed to both functions will
          not be removed by the -c option.

          Examples:

NoClean('foo.elf')
NoClean(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

   env.ParseConfig(command, [function, unique])
          Calls the specified function to modify the environment as
          specified by the output of command. The default function is
          [1127]env.MergeFlags, which expects the output of a typical
          *-config command (for example, gtk-config) and adds the options
          to the appropriate construction variables. By default, duplicate
          values are not added to any construction variables; you can
          specify unique=0 to allow duplicate values to be added.

          Interpreted options and the construction variables they affect
          are as specified for the [1128]env.ParseFlags method (which this
          method calls). See that method's description for a table of
          options and construction variables.

   ParseDepends(filename, [must_exist, only_one])
          env.ParseDepends(filename, [must_exist, only_one])
          Parses the contents of the specified filename as a list of
          dependencies in the style of Make or mkdep, and explicitly
          establishes all of the listed dependencies.

          By default, it is not an error if the specified filename does
          not exist. The optional must_exist argument may be set to a
          non-zero value to have scons throw an exception and generate an
          error if the file does not exist, or is otherwise inaccessible.

          The optional only_one argument may be set to a non-zero value to
          have scons thrown an exception and generate an error if the file
          contains dependency information for more than one target. This
          can provide a small sanity check for files intended to be
          generated by, for example, the gcc -M flag, which should
          typically only write dependency information for one output file
          into a corresponding .d file.

          The filename and all of the files listed therein will be
          interpreted relative to the directory of the SConscript file
          which calls the ParseDepends function.

   env.ParseFlags(flags, ...)
          Parses one or more strings containing typical command-line flags
          for GCC tool chains and returns a dictionary with the flag
          values separated into the appropriate SCons construction
          variables. This is intended as a companion to the
          [1129]env.MergeFlags method, but allows for the values in the
          returned dictionary to be modified, if necessary, before merging
          them into the construction environment. (Note that
          env.MergeFlags will call this method if its argument is not a
          dictionary, so it is usually not necessary to call
          [1130]env.ParseFlags directly unless you want to manipulate the
          values.)

          If the first character in any string is an exclamation mark (!),
          the rest of the string is executed as a command, and the output
          from the command is parsed as GCC tool chain command-line flags
          and added to the resulting dictionary.

          Flag values are translated accordig to the prefix found, and
          added to the following construction variables:

-arch                   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-D                      CPPDEFINES
-framework              FRAMEWORKS
-frameworkdir=          FRAMEWORKPATH
-fmerge-all-constants   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-fopenmp                CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-include                CCFLAGS
-imacros                CCFLAGS
-isysroot               CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-isystem                CCFLAGS
-iquote                 CCFLAGS
-idirafter              CCFLAGS
-I                      CPPPATH
-l                      LIBS
-L                      LIBPATH
-mno-cygwin             CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-mwindows               LINKFLAGS
-openmp                 CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-pthread                CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-std=                   CFLAGS
-Wa,                    ASFLAGS, CCFLAGS
-Wl,-rpath=             RPATH
-Wl,-R,                 RPATH
-Wl,-R                  RPATH
-Wl,                    LINKFLAGS
-Wp,                    CPPFLAGS
-                       CCFLAGS
+                       CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS

          Any other strings not associated with options are assumed to be
          the names of libraries and added to the $LIBS construction
          variable.

          Examples (all of which produce the same result):

dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2 -Dfoo -Dbar=1')
dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '-Dfoo', '-Dbar=1')
dict = env.ParseFlags(['-O2', '-Dfoo -Dbar=1'])
dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '!echo -Dfoo -Dbar=1')

   Platform(string)
          The Platform form returns a callable object that can be used to
          initialize a construction environment using the platform keyword
          of the Environment function.

          Example:

env = Environment(platform = Platform('win32'))

          The env.Platform form applies the callable object for the
          specified platform string to the environment through which the
          method was called.

env.Platform('posix')

          Note that the win32 platform adds the SystemDrive and SystemRoot
          variables from the user's external environment to the
          construction environment's [1131]$ENV dictionary. This is so
          that any executed commands that use sockets to connect with
          other systems (such as fetching source files from external CVS
          repository specifications like
          :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/scons) will work
          on Windows systems.

   Precious(target, ...)
          env.Precious(target, ...)
          Marks each given target as precious so it is not deleted before
          it is rebuilt. Normally scons deletes a target before building
          it. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call to
          Precious.

   env.Prepend(key=val, [...])
          Appends the specified keyword arguments to the beginning of
          construction variables in the environment. If the Environment
          does not have the specified construction variable, it is simply
          added to the environment. If the values of the construction
          variable and the keyword argument are the same type, then the
          two values will be simply added together. Otherwise, the
          construction variable and the value of the keyword argument are
          both coerced to lists, and the lists are added together. (See
          also the Append method, above.)

          Example:

env.Prepend(CCFLAGS = '-g ', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

   env.PrependENVPath(name, newpath, [envname, sep, delete_existing])
          This appends new path elements to the given path in the
          specified external environment ($ENV by default). This will only
          add any particular path once (leaving the first one it
          encounters and ignoring the rest, to preserve path order), and
          to help assure this, will normalize all paths (using
          os.path.normpath and os.path.normcase). This can also handle the
          case where the given old path variable is a list instead of a
          string, in which case a list will be returned instead of a
          string.

          If delete_existing is 0, then adding a path that already exists
          will not move it to the beginning; it will stay where it is in
          the list.

          Example:

print 'before:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.PrependENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print 'after:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']

          The above example will print:

before: /biz:/foo
after: /foo/bar:/foo:/biz

   env.PrependUnique(key=val, delete_existing=0, [...])
          Appends the specified keyword arguments to the beginning of
          construction variables in the environment. If the Environment
          does not have the specified construction variable, it is simply
          added to the environment. If the construction variable being
          appended to is a list, then any value(s) that already exist in
          the construction variable will not be added again to the list.
          However, if delete_existing is 1, existing matching values are
          removed first, so existing values in the arg list move to the
          front of the list.

          Example:

env.PrependUnique(CCFLAGS = '-g', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

   Progress(callable, [interval])
          Progress(string, [interval, file, overwrite])
          Progress(list_of_strings, [interval, file, overwrite])
          Allows SCons to show progress made during the build by
          displaying a string or calling a function while evaluating Nodes
          (e.g. files).

          If the first specified argument is a Python callable (a function
          or an object that has a __call__ method), the function will be
          called once every interval times a Node is evaluated (default
          1). The callable will be passed the evaluated Node as its only
          argument. (For future compatibility, it's a good idea to also
          add *args and **kwargs as arguments to your function or method
          signatures. This will prevent the code from breaking if SCons
          ever changes the interface to call the function with additional
          arguments in the future.)

          An example of a simple custom progress function that prints a
          string containing the Node name every 10 Nodes:

def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kwargs):
    print('Evaluating node %s!' % node)
Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)

          A more complicated example of a custom progress display object
          that prints a string containing a count every 100 evaluated
          Nodes. Note the use of \r (a carriage return) at the end so that
          the string will overwrite itself on a display:

import sys
class ProgressCounter(object):
    count = 0
    def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
        self.count += 100
        sys.stderr.write('Evaluated %s nodes\r' % self.count)

Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)

          If the first argument to Progress is a string or list of
          strings, it is taken as text to be displayed every interval
          evaluated Nodes. If the first argument is a list of strings,
          then each string in the list will be displayed in rotating
          fashion every interval evaluated Nodes.

          The default is to print the string on standard output. An
          alternate output stream may be specified with the file keyword
          argument, which the caller must pass already opened.

          The following will print a series of dots on the error output,
          one dot for every 100 evaluated Nodes:

import sys
Progress('.', interval=100, file=sys.stderr)

          If the string contains the verbatim substring $TARGET;, it will
          be replaced with the Node. Note that, for performance reasons,
          this is not a regular SCons variable substition, so you can not
          use other variables or use curly braces. The following example
          will print the name of every evaluated Node, using a carriage
          return) (\r) to cause each line to overwritten by the next line,
          and the overwrite keyword argument (default False) to make sure
          the previously-printed file name is overwritten with blank
          spaces:

import sys
Progress('$TARGET\r', overwrite=True)

          A list of strings can be used to implement a "spinner" on the
          user's screen as follows, changing every five evaluated Nodes:

Progress(['-\r', '\\\r', '|\r', '/\r'], interval=5)

   Pseudo(target, ...)
          env.Pseudo(target, ...)
          This indicates that each given target should not be created by
          the build rule, and if the target is created, an error will be
          generated. This is similar to the gnu make .PHONY target.
          However, in the vast majority of cases, an Alias is more
          appropriate. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call
          to Pseudo.

   PyPackageDir(modulename)
          env.PyPackageDir(modulename)
          This returns a Directory Node similar to Dir. The python module
          / package is looked up and if located the directory is returned
          for the location. modulename Is a named python package / module
          to lookup the directory for it's location.

          If modulename is a list, SCons returns a list of Dir nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in modulename.

   env.Replace(key=val, [...])
          Replaces construction variables in the Environment with the
          specified keyword arguments.

          Example:

env.Replace(CCFLAGS = '-g', FOO = 'foo.xxx')

   Repository(directory)
          env.Repository(directory)
          Specifies that directory is a repository to be searched for
          files. Multiple calls to Repository are legal, and each one adds
          to the list of repositories that will be searched.

          To scons, a repository is a copy of the source tree, from the
          top-level directory on down, which may contain both source files
          and derived files that can be used to build targets in the local
          source tree. The canonical example would be an official source
          tree maintained by an integrator. If the repository contains
          derived files, then the derived files should have been built
          using scons, so that the repository contains the necessary
          signature information to allow scons to figure out when it is
          appropriate to use the repository copy of a derived file,
          instead of building one locally.

          Note that if an up-to-date derived file already exists in a
          repository, scons will not make a copy in the local directory
          tree. In order to guarantee that a local copy will be made, use
          the [1132]Local method.

   Requires(target, prerequisite)
          env.Requires(target, prerequisite)
          Specifies an order-only relationship between the specified
          target file(s) and the specified prerequisite file(s). The
          prerequisite file(s) will be (re)built, if necessary, before the
          target file(s), but the target file(s) do not actually depend on
          the prerequisites and will not be rebuilt simply because the
          prerequisite file(s) change.

          Example:

env.Requires('foo', 'file-that-must-be-built-before-foo')

   Return([vars..., stop=True])
          Return to the calling SConscript, optionally returning the
          values of variables named in vars. Multiple strings contaning
          variable names may be passed to Return. A string containing
          white space is split into individual variable names. Returns the
          value if one variable is specified, else returns a tuple of
          values. Returns an empty tuple if vars is omitted.

          By default Return stops processing the current SConscript and
          returns immediately. The optional stop keyword argument may be
          set to a false value to continue processing the rest of the
          SConscript file after the Return call (this was the default
          behavior prior to SCons 0.98.) However, the values returned are
          still the values of the variables in the named vars at the point
          Return was called.

          Examples:

# Returns no values (evaluates False)
Return()

# Returns the value of the 'foo' Python variable.
Return("foo")

# Returns the values of the Python variables 'foo' and 'bar'.
Return("foo", "bar")

# Returns the values of Python variables 'val1' and 'val2'.
Return('val1 val2')

   Scanner(function, [name, argument, skeys, path_function, node_class,
          node_factory, scan_check, recursive])
          env.Scanner(function, [name, argument, skeys, path_function,
          node_class, node_factory, scan_check, recursive])
          Creates a Scanner object for the specified function. See manpage
          section "Scanner Objects" for a complete explanation of the
          arguments and behavior.

   SConscript(scripts, [exports, variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist])
          env.SConscript(scripts, [exports, variant_dir, duplicate,
          must_exist])
          SConscript(dirs=subdirs, [name=script, exports, variant_dir,
          duplicate, must_exist])
          env.SConscript(dirs=subdirs, [name=script, exports, variant_dir,
          duplicate, must_exist])
          Execute one or more subsidiary SConscript (configuration) files.
          There are two ways to call the SConscript function.

          The first calling style is to explicitly specify one or more
          scripts as the first argument. A single script may be specified
          as a string; multiple scripts must be specified as a list
          (either explicitly or as created by a function like
          [1133]Split). Examples:

SConscript('SConscript')      # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript('src/SConscript')  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(['src/SConscript', 'doc/SConscript'])
config = SConscript('MyConfig.py')

          The second way to call SConscript is to specify a list of
          (sub)directory names as a dirs=subdirs keyword argument. In this
          case, scons will execute a subsidiary configuration file named
          SConscript in each of the specified directories. You may specify
          a name other than SConscript by supplying an optional
          name=script keyword argument. The first three examples below
          have the same effect as the first three examples above:

SConscript(dirs='.')      # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(dirs='src')    # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(dirs=['src', 'doc'])
SConscript(dirs=['sub1', 'sub2'], name='MySConscript')

          The optional exports argument provides a string or list of
          strings representing variable names, or a dictionary of named
          values, to export. These variables are locally exported only to
          the called SConscript file(s) and do not affect the global pool
          of variables managed by the [1134]Export function. The
          subsidiary SConscript files must use the [1135]Import function
          to import the variables. Examples:

foo = SConscript('sub/SConscript', exports='env')
SConscript('dir/SConscript', exports=['env', 'variable'])
SConscript(dirs='subdir', exports='env variable')
SConscript(dirs=['one', 'two', 'three'], exports='shared_info')

          If the optional variant_dir argument is present, it causes an
          effect equivalent to the [1136]VariantDir function. The
          variant_dir argument is interpreted relative to the directory of
          the calling SConscript file. The optional duplicate argument is
          interpreted as for [1137]VariantDir. If variant_dir is omitted,
          the duplicate argument is ignored. See the description of
          [1138]VariantDir below for additional details and restrictions.

          If variant_dir is present, the source directory is the directory
          in which the SConscript file resides and the SConscript file is
          evaluated as if it were in the variant_dir directory:

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build')

          is equivalent to

VariantDir('build', 'src')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

          This later paradigm is often used when the sources are in the
          same directory as the SConstruct:

SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='build')

          is equivalent to

VariantDir('build', '.')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

          If the optional must_exist is True, causes an exception to be
          raised if a requested SConscript file is not found. The current
          default is False, causing only a warning to be emitted, but this
          default is deprecated (since 3.1). For scripts which truly
          intend to be optional, transition to explicitly supplying
          must_exist=False to the SConscript call.

          Here are some composite examples:

# collect the configuration information and use it to build src and doc
shared_info = SConscript('MyConfig.py')
SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='shared_info')
SConscript('doc/SConscript', exports='shared_info')

# build debugging and production versions.  SConscript
# can use Dir('.').path to determine variant.
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0)
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0)

# build debugging and production versions.  SConscript
# is passed flags to use.
opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['DEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-pgdb' }
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0, exports=opts)
opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['NODEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-O' }
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0, exports=opts)

# build common documentation and compile for different architectures
SConscript('doc/SConscript', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/x86', duplicate=0)
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/ppc', duplicate=0)

          SConscript returns the values of any variables named by the
          executed SConscript(s) in arguments to the [1139]Return function
          (see above for details). If a single SConscript call causes
          multiple scripts to be executed, the return value is a tuple
          containing the returns of all of the scripts. If an executed
          script does not explicitly call Return, it returns None.

   SConscriptChdir(value)
          env.SConscriptChdir(value)
          By default, scons changes its working directory to the directory
          in which each subsidiary SConscript file lives. This behavior
          may be disabled by specifying either:

SConscriptChdir(0)
env.SConscriptChdir(0)

          in which case scons will stay in the top-level directory while
          reading all SConscript files. (This may be necessary when
          building from repositories, when all the directories in which
          SConscript files may be found don't necessarily exist locally.)
          You may enable and disable this ability by calling
          SConscriptChdir() multiple times.

          Example:

env = Environment()
SConscriptChdir(0)
SConscript('foo/SConscript')    # will not chdir to foo
env.SConscriptChdir(1)
SConscript('bar/SConscript')    # will chdir to bar

   SConsignFile([name, dbm_module])
          env.SConsignFile([name, dbm_module])
          Specify where to store the SCons file signature database, and
          which database format to use. This may be useful to specify
          alternate database files and/or file locations for different
          types of builds.

          The optional name argument is the base name of the database
          file(s). If not an absolute path name, these are placed relative
          to the directory containing the top-level SConstruct file. The
          default is .sconsign. The actual database file(s) stored on disk
          may have an appropriate suffix appended by the chosen dbm_module

          The optional dbm_module argument specifies which Python database
          module to use for reading/writing the file. The module must be
          imported first; then the imported module name is passed as the
          argument. The default is a custom SCons.dblite module that uses
          pickled Python data structures, which works on all Python
          versions. See documentation of the Python dbm module for other
          available types.

          If called with no arguments, the database will default to
          .sconsign.dblite in the top directory of the project, which is
          also the default if if SConsignFile is not called.

          The setting is global, so the only difference between the global
          function and the environment method form is variable expansion
          on name. There should only be one active call to this
          function/method in a given build setup.

          If name is set to None, scons will store file signatures in a
          separate .sconsign file in each directory, not in a single
          combined database file. This is a backwards-compatibility meaure
          to support what was the default behavior prior to SCons 0.97
          (i.e. before 2008). Use of this mode is discouraged and may be
          deprecated in a future SCons release.

          Examples:

# Explicitly stores signatures in ".sconsign.dblite"
# in the top-level SConstruct directory (the default behavior).
SConsignFile()

# Stores signatures in the file "etc/scons-signatures"
# relative to the top-level SConstruct directory.
# SCons will add a database suffix to this name.
SConsignFile("etc/scons-signatures")

# Stores signatures in the specified absolute file name.
# SCons will add a database suffix to this name.
SConsignFile("/home/me/SCons/signatures")

# Stores signatures in a separate .sconsign file
# in each directory.
SConsignFile(None)

# Stores signatures in a GNU dbm format .sconsign file
import dbm.gnu
SConsignFile(dbm_module=dbm.gnu)

   env.SetDefault(key=val, [...])
          Sets construction variables to default values specified with the
          keyword arguments if (and only if) the variables are not already
          set. The following statements are equivalent:

env.SetDefault(FOO = 'foo')

if 'FOO' not in env: env['FOO'] = 'foo'

   SetOption(name, value)
          env.SetOption(name, value)
          Sets scons option variable name to value. These options are all
          also settable via scons command-line options but the variable
          name may differ from the command-line option name (see table). A
          value set via command-line option will take precedence over one
          set with SetOption, which allows setting a project default in
          the scripts and temporarily overriding it via command line.
          Options which affect the reading and processing of SConscript
          files are not settable this way, since those files must be read
          in order to find the SetOption call.

          The settable variables with their associated command-line
          options are:

             Variable                  Command-line options
          clean          -c, --clean, --remove
          diskcheck      --diskcheck
          duplicate      --duplicate
          help           -h, --help
          implicit_cache --implicit-cache
          max_drift      --max-drift
          md5_chunksize  --md5-chunksize
          no_exec        -n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
          no_progress    -Q
          num_jobs       -j, --jobs
          random         --random
          silent         --silent.
          stack_size     --stack-size
          warn           --warn.

          See the documentation in the manpage for the corresponding
          command line option for information about each specific option.
          Option values which are boolean in nature (that is, they are
          either on or off) should be set to a true value (True, 1) or a
          false value (False, 0).

Note

          If no_progress is set via SetOption there will still be initial
          progress output as SCons has to start reading SConscript files
          before it can see the SetOption in an SConscript file: scons:
          Reading SConscript files ...

          Example:

SetOption('max_drift', True)

   SideEffect(side_effect, target)
          env.SideEffect(side_effect, target)
          Declares side_effect as a side effect of building target. Both
          side_effect and target can be a list, a file name, or a node. A
          side effect is a target file that is created or updated as a
          side effect of building other targets. For example, a Windows
          PDB file is created as a side effect of building the .obj files
          for a static library, and various log files are created updated
          as side effects of various TeX commands. If a target is a side
          effect of multiple build commands, scons will ensure that only
          one set of commands is executed at a time. Consequently, you
          only need to use this method for side-effect targets that are
          built as a result of multiple build commands.

          Because multiple build commands may update the same side effect
          file, by default the side_effect target is not automatically
          removed when the target is removed by the -c option. (Note,
          however, that the side_effect might be removed as part of
          cleaning the directory in which it lives.) If you want to make
          sure the side_effect is cleaned whenever a specific target is
          cleaned, you must specify this explicitly with the [1140]Clean
          or env.Clean function.

          This function returns the list of side effect Node objects that
          were successfully added. If the list of side effects contained
          any side effects that had already been added, they are not added
          and included in the returned list.

   Split(arg)
          env.Split(arg)
          Returns a list of file names or other objects. If arg is a
          string, it will be split on strings of white-space characters
          within the string, making it easier to write long lists of file
          names. If arg is already a list, the list will be returned
          untouched. If arg is any other type of object, it will be
          returned as a list containing just the object.

          Example:

files = Split("f1.c f2.c f3.c")
files = env.Split("f4.c f5.c f6.c")
files = Split("""
       f7.c
       f8.c
       f9.c
""")

   env.subst(input, [raw, target, source, conv])
          Performs construction variable interpolation on the specified
          string or sequence argument input.

          By default, leading or trailing white space will be removed from
          the result. and all sequences of white space will be compressed
          to a single space character. Additionally, any $( and $)
          character sequences will be stripped from the returned string,
          The optional raw argument may be set to 1 if you want to
          preserve white space and $(-$) sequences. The raw argument may
          be set to 2 if you want to strip all characters between any $(
          and $) pairs (as is done for signature calculation).

          If the input is a sequence (list or tuple), the individual
          elements of the sequence will be expanded, and the results will
          be returned as a list.

          The optional target and source keyword arguments must be set to
          lists of target and source nodes, respectively, if you want the
          $TARGET, $TARGETS, $SOURCE and $SOURCES to be available for
          expansion. This is usually necessary if you are calling
          env.subst from within a Python function used as an SCons action.

          Returned string values or sequence elements are converted to
          their string representation by default. The optional conv
          argument may specify a conversion function that will be used in
          place of the default. For example, if you want Python objects
          (including SCons Nodes) to be returned as Python objects, you
          can use the Python L idiom to pass in an unnamed function that
          simply returns its unconverted argument.

          Example:

print(env.subst("The C compiler is: $CC"))

def compile(target, source, env):
    sourceDir = env.subst("${SOURCE.srcdir}",
                          target=target,
                          source=source)

source_nodes = env.subst('$EXPAND_TO_NODELIST',
                         conv=lambda x: x)

   Tag(node, tags)
          Annotates file or directory Nodes with information about how the
          [1141]Package Builder should package those files or directories.
          All Node-level tags are optional.

          Examples:

# makes sure the built library will be installed with 644 file access mode
Tag(Library('lib.c'), UNIX_ATTR="0o644")

# marks file2.txt to be a documentation file
Tag('file2.txt', DOC)

   Tool(name, [toolpath, **kwargs])
          env.Tool(name, [toolpath, **kwargs])
          Runs the tool identified by name, which is searched for in
          standard locations and any paths specified by the optional
          toolpath, to update a construction environment with construction
          variables needed to use the mechanisms that tool describes. Any
          additional keyword arguments kwargs are passed on to the tool
          module's generate function.

          When called as a construction environment method, the tool
          module is called to update the construction environment and the
          name of the tool is appended to the [1142]$TOOLS construction
          variable in that environment.

          Examples:

env.Tool('gcc')
env.Tool('opengl', toolpath=['build/tools'])

          When called as a global function, returns a callable tool
          object; the tool is not called at this time, as it lacks the
          context of an environment to update. This tool object can be
          passed to an [1143]Environment or [1144]Clone call as part of
          the tools keyword argument, or it can be called directly,
          passing a construction environment to update as the argument.
          Either approach will also update the $TOOLS construction
          variable.

          Examples:

env = Environment(tools=[Tool('msvc')])

env = Environment()
t = Tool('msvc')
t(env)  # adds 'msvc' to the TOOLS variable
u = Tool('opengl', toolpath = ['tools'])
u(env)  # adds 'opengl' to the TOOLS variable

   Value(value, [built_value], [name])
          env.Value(value, [built_value], [name])
          Returns a Node object representing the specified Python value.
          Value Nodes can be used as dependencies of targets. If the
          result of calling str(value) changes between SCons runs, any
          targets depending on Value(value) will be rebuilt. (This is true
          even when using timestamps to decide if files are up-to-date.)
          When using timestamp source signatures, Value Nodes' timestamps
          are equal to the system time when the Node is created. name can
          be provided as an alternative name for the resulting Value node;
          this is advised if the value parameter can't be converted to a
          string.

          The returned Value Node object has a write() method that can be
          used to "build" a Value Node by setting a new value. The
          optional built_value argument can be specified when the Value
          Node is created to indicate the Node should already be
          considered "built." There is a corresponding read() method that
          will return the built value of the Node.

          Examples:

env = Environment()

def create(target, source, env):
    # A function that will write a 'prefix=$SOURCE'
    # string into the file name specified as the
    # $TARGET.
    with open(str(target[0]), 'wb') as f:
        f.write('prefix=' + source[0].get_contents())

# Fetch the prefix= argument, if any, from the command
# line, and use /usr/local as the default.
prefix = ARGUMENTS.get('prefix', '/usr/local')

# Attach a .Config() builder for the above function action
# to the construction environment.
env['BUILDERS']['Config'] = Builder(action = create)
env.Config(target = 'package-config', source = Value(prefix))

def build_value(target, source, env):
    # A function that "builds" a Python Value by updating
    # the the Python value with the contents of the file
    # specified as the source of the Builder call ($SOURCE).
    target[0].write(source[0].get_contents())

output = env.Value('before')
input = env.Value('after')

# Attach a .UpdateValue() builder for the above function
# action to the construction environment.
env['BUILDERS']['UpdateValue'] = Builder(action = build_value)
env.UpdateValue(target = Value(output), source = Value(input))

   VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])
          env.VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])
          Sets up an alternate build location. When building in the
          variant_dir, SCons backfills as needed with files from src_dir
          to create a complete build directory. VariantDir can be called
          multiple times with the same src_dir to set up multiple builds
          with different options (variants).

          The variant location must be in or underneath the project top
          directory, and src_dir may not be underneath variant_dir.

          By default, SCons physically duplicates the source files and
          SConscript files as needed into the variant tree. Thus, a build
          performed in the variant tree is guaranteed to be identical to a
          build performed in the source tree even if intermediate source
          files are generated during the build, or if preprocessors or
          other scanners search for included files relative to the source
          file, or if individual compilers or other invoked tools are
          hard-coded to put derived files in the same directory as source
          files. Only the files SCons calculates are needed for the build
          are duplicated into variant_dir.

          If possible on the platform, the duplication is performed by
          linking rather than copying. This behavior is affected by the
          --duplicate command-line option.

          Duplicating the source files may be disabled by setting the
          duplicate argument to False. This will cause SCons to invoke
          Builders using the path names of source files in src_dir and the
          path names of derived files within variant_dir. This is more
          efficient than duplicate=True, and is safe for most builds;
          revert to True if it causes problems.

          VariantDir works most naturally with used with a subsidiary
          SConscript file. The subsidiary SConscript file is called as if
          it were in variant_dir, regardless of the value of duplicate.
          This is how you tell scons which variant of a source tree to
          build:

# run src/SConscript in two variant directories
VariantDir('build/variant1', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant1/SConscript')
VariantDir('build/variant2', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant2/SConscript')

          See also the [1145]SConscript function, described above, for
          another way to specify a variant directory in conjunction with
          calling a subsidiary SConscript file.

          Examples:

# use names in the build directory, not the source directory
VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=0)
Program('build/prog', 'build/source.c')

# this builds both the source and docs in a separate subtree
VariantDir('build', '.', duplicate=0)
SConscript(dirs=['build/src','build/doc'])

# same as previous example, but only uses SConscript
SConscript(dirs='src', variant_dir='build/src', duplicate=0)
SConscript(dirs='doc', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)

   WhereIs(program, [path, pathext, reject])
          env.WhereIs(program, [path, pathext, reject])
          Searches for the specified executable program, returning the
          full path to the program or None.

          When called as a construction environment method, searches the
          paths in the path keyword argument, or if None (the default) the
          paths listed in the construction environment
          (env['ENV']['PATH']). The external environment's path list
          (os.environ['PATH']) is used as a fallback if the key
          env['ENV']['PATH'] does not exist.

          On Windows systems, searches for executable programs with any of
          the file extensions listed in the pathext keyword argument, or
          if None (the default) the pathname extensions listed in the
          construction environment (env['ENV']['PATHEXT']). The external
          environment's pathname extensions list (os.environ['PATHEXT'])
          is used as a fallback if the key env['ENV']['PATHEXT'] does not
          exist.

          When called as a global function, uses the external
          environment's path os.environ['PATH'] and path extensions
          os.environ['PATHEXT'], respectively, if path and pathext are
          None.

          Will not select any path name or names in the optional reject
          list.

SConscript Variables

   In addition to the global functions and methods, scons supports a
   number of variables that can be used in SConscript files to affect how
   you want the build to be performed.

   ARGLIST
          A list of the keyword=value arguments specified on the command
          line. Each element in the list is a tuple containing the
          argument. The separate keyword and value elements of the tuple
          can be accessed by subscripting for elements [0] and [1] of the
          tuple, or, more readably, by using tuple unpacking. Example:

print("first keyword, value =", ARGLIST[0][0], ARGLIST[0][1])
print("second keyword, value =", ARGLIST[1][0], ARGLIST[1][1])
key, value = ARGLIST[2]
print("third keyword, value =", key, value)
for key, value in ARGLIST:
    # process key and value

   ARGUMENTS
          A dictionary of all the keyword=value arguments specified on the
          command line. The dictionary is not in order, and if a given
          keyword has more than one value assigned to it on the command
          line, the last (right-most) value is the one in the ARGUMENTS
          dictionary.

          Example:

if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')
else:
    env = Environment()

   BUILD_TARGETS
          A list of the targets which scons has been asked to build. The
          contents will be either those targets listed on the command
          line, or, if none, those targets set via calls to the
          [1146]Default function. It does not contain any dependent
          targets that scons selects for building as a result of making
          the sure the specified targets are up to date, if those targets
          did not appear on the command line. The list is empty if neither
          command line targets or Default calls are present.

          The elements of this list may be strings or nodes, so you should
          run the list through the Python str function to make sure any
          Node path names are converted to strings.

          Because this list may be taken from the list of targets
          specified using the Default function, the contents of the list
          may change on each successive call to Default. See the
          DEFAULT_TARGETS list, below, for additional information.

          Example:

if 'foo' in BUILD_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
if 'special/program' in BUILD_TARGETS:
    SConscript('special')

   COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS
          A list of the targets explicitly specified on the command line.
          If there are command line targets, this list will have the same
          contents as BUILD_TARGETS. If there are no targets specified on
          the command line, the list is empty. The elements of this list
          are strings. This can be used, for example, to take specific
          actions only when certain targets are explicitly being built.

          Example:

if 'foo' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
if 'special/program' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    SConscript('special')

   DEFAULT_TARGETS
          A list of the target nodes that have been specified using the
          [1147]Default function. If there are no command line targets,
          this list will have the same contents as BUILD_TARGETS. Since
          the elements of the list are nodes, you need to call the Python
          str function on them to get the path name for each Node.

          Example:

print(str(DEFAULT_TARGETS[0]))
if 'foo' in [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS]:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")

          The contents of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list change on on each
          successive call to the Default function:

print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # originally []
Default('foo')
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo']
Default('bar')
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo', 'bar']
Default(None)
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # back to []

          Consequently, be sure to use DEFAULT_TARGETS only after you've
          made all of your Default() calls, or else simply be careful of
          the order of these statements in your SConscript files so that
          you don't look for a specific default target before it's
          actually been added to the list.

   These variables may be accessed from custom Python modules that you
   import into an SConscript file by adding the following to the Python
   module:
from SCons.Script import *

Construction Variables

   A construction environment has an associated dictionary of construction
   variables that are used by built-in or user-supplied build rules.
   Construction variable naming must follow the same rules as Python
   identifier naming: the initial character must be an underscore or
   letter, followed by any number of underscores, letters, or digits. A
   construction environment is not a Python dictionary itself, but it can
   be indexed like one to access a construction variable:
env["CC"] = "cc"

   Construction variables can also be retrieved and set by using the
   [1148]Dictionary method of the construction environment to create an
   actual dictionary:
cvars = env.Dictionary()
cvars["CC"] = "cc"

   Construction variables can also be passed to the construction
   environment constructor:
env = Environment(CC="cc")

   or when copying a construction environment using the [1149]Clone
   method:
env2 = env.Clone(CC="cl.exe")

   A number of useful construction variables are automatically defined by
   scons for each supported platform, and additional construction
   variables can be defined by the user. The following is a list of the
   possible automatically defined construction variables. The actual list
   available at execution time will not include all of these, as the ones
   detected as not being useful (wrong platform, necessary external
   command or files not installed, etc.) will not be set up. :

   __LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          This construction variable automatically introduces
          [1150]$_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS if [1151]$LDMODULEVERSION is set.
          Othervise it evaluates to an empty string.

   __SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          This construction variable automatically introduces
          [1152]$_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS if [1153]$SHLIBVERSION is set.
          Othervise it evaluates to an empty string.

   APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag:
          -compatibility_version

          The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and
          65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and 255, Z can be omitted
          or between 1 and 255. This value will be derived from
          [1154]$SHLIBVERSION if not specified. The lowest digit will be
          dropped and replaced by a 0.

          If the [1155]$APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION is set then no
          -compatibility_version will be output.

          See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

   _APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the
          linker flags to specify apple's linker's -compatibility_version
          flag. The default generator uses
          [1156]$APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and
          [1157]$APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and
          [1158]$SHLIBVERSION to determine the correct flag.

   APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION
          On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag:
          -current_version

          The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and
          65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and 255, Z can be omitted
          or between 1 and 255. This value will be set to
          [1159]$SHLIBVERSION if not specified.

          If the [1160]$APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION is set then no
          -current_version will be output.

          See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

   _APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION
          A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the
          linker flags to specify apple's linker's -current_version flag.
          The default generator uses [1161]$APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION and
          [1162]$APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION and [1163]$SHLIBVERSION to
          determine the correct flag.

   APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable
          adding -compatibility_version flag when generating versioned
          shared libraries.

          This overrides [1164]$APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION.

   APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION
          Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable
          adding -current_version flag when generating versioned shared
          libraries.

          This overrides [1165]$APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION.

   AR
          The static library archiver.

   ARCHITECTURE
          Specifies the system architecture for which the package is being
          built. The default is the system architecture of the machine on
          which SCons is running. This is used to fill in the
          Architecture: field in an Ipkg control file, and the BuildArch:
          field in the RPM .spec file, as well as forming part of the name
          of a generated RPM package file.

   ARCOM
          The command line used to generate a static library from object
          files.

   ARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a static library is generated from
          object files. If this is not set, then [1166]$ARCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   ARFLAGS
          General options passed to the static library archiver.

   AS
          The assembler.

   ASCOM
          The command line used to generate an object file from an
          assembly-language source file.

   ASCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file. If this is not set, then
          [1167]$ASCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

   ASFLAGS
          General options passed to the assembler.

   ASPPCOM
          The command line used to assemble an assembly-language source
          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1168]$ASFLAGS
          and [1169]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line.

   ASPPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file after first running the file
          through the C preprocessor. If this is not set, then
          [1170]$ASPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASPPCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

   ASPPFLAGS
          General options when an assembling an assembly-language source
          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. The default is to use the value of
          [1171]$ASFLAGS.

   BIBTEX
          The bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter
          and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   BIBTEXCOM
          The command line used to call the bibliography generator for the
          TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter.

   BIBTEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a bibliography for TeX or
          LaTeX. If this is not set, then [1172]$BIBTEXCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(BIBTEXCOMSTR = "Generating bibliography $TARGET")

   BIBTEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the bibliography generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   BUILDERS
          A dictionary mapping the names of the builders available through
          the construction environment to underlying Builder objects.
          Custom builders need to be added to this to make them available.

          A platform-dependent default list of builders such as
          [1173]Program, [1174]Library etc. is used to populate this
          construction variable when the construction environment is
          initialized via the presence/absence of the tools those builders
          depend on. $BUILDERS can be examined to learn which builders
          will actually be available at run-time.

          Note that if you initialize this construction variable through
          assignment when the construction environment is created, that
          value for $BUILDERS will override any defaults:

bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'NewBuilder': bld})

          To instead use a new Builder object in addition to the default
          Builders, add your new Builder object like this:

env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS={'NewBuilder': bld})

          or this:

env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS']['NewBuilder'] = bld

   CC
          The C compiler.

   CCCOM
          The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static)
          object file. Any options specified in the [1175]$CFLAGS,
          [1176]$CCFLAGS and [1177]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are
          included on this command line. See also [1178]$SHCCCOM for
          compiling to shared objects.

   CCCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a C source file is compiled to
          a (static) object file. If not set, then [1179]$CCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed. See also [1180]$SHCCCOMSTR for
          compiling to shared objects.

env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CCFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C and C++ compilers. See
          also [1181]$SHCCFLAGS for compiling to shared objects.

   CCPCHFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support building
          with precompiled headers. The default value expands expands to
          the appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options when
          the [1182]$PCH construction variable is set.

   CCPDBFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support storing
          debugging information in a Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file. The
          default value expands expands to appropriate Microsoft Visual
          C++ command-line options when the [1183]$PDB construction
          variable is set.

          The Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by default to
          generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with
          parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in
          the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single
          PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only
          way to get debug information embedded into a static library.
          Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance,
          although parallel builds will no longer work.

          You can generate PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the
          default [1184]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = ['${(PDB and "/Zi /Fd%s" % File(PDB)) or ""}']

          An alternative would be to use the /Zi to put the debugging
          information in a separate .pdb file for each object file by
          overriding the [1185]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = '/Zi /Fd${TARGET}.pdb'

   CCVERSION
          The version number of the C compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C compiler being used.

   CFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C source files. This is used by the internal
          CFile builder when generating C files from Lex (.l) or YACC (.y)
          input files. The default suffix, of course, is .c (lower case).
          On case-insensitive systems (like Windows), SCons also treats .C
          (upper case) files as C files.

   CFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C compiler (C only; not
          C++). See also [1186]$SHCFLAGS for compiling to shared objects.

   CHANGE_SPECFILE
          A hook for modifying the file that controls the packaging build
          (the .spec for RPM, the control for Ipkg, the .wxs for MSI). If
          set, the function will be called after the SCons template for
          the file has been written.

   CHANGED_SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   CHANGED_TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   CHANGELOG
          The name of a file containing the change log text to be included
          in the package. This is included as the %changelog section of
          the RPM .spec file.

   COMPILATIONDB_COMSTR
          The string displayed when the CompilationDatabase builder's
          action is run.

   COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER
          A string which instructs [1187]CompilationDatabase to only
          include entries where the output member matches the pattern in
          the filter string using fnmatch, which uses glob style
          wildcards.

          The default value is an empty string '', which disables
          filtering.

   COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH
          A boolean flag to instruct [1188]CompilationDatabase whether to
          write the file and output members in the compilation database
          using absolute or relative paths.

          The default value is False (use relative paths)

   _concat
          A function used to produce variables like $_CPPINCFLAGS. It
          takes four or five arguments: a prefix to concatenate onto each
          element, a list of elements, a suffix to concatenate onto each
          element, an environment for variable interpolation, and an
          optional function that will be called to transform the list
          before concatenation.

env['_CPPINCFLAGS'] = '$( ${_concat(INCPREFIX, CPPPATH, INCSUFFIX, __env__, RDir
s)} $)',

   CONFIGUREDIR
          The name of the directory in which Configure context test files
          are written. The default is .sconf_temp in the top-level
          directory containing the SConstruct file.

   CONFIGURELOG
          The name of the Configure context log file. The default is
          config.log in the top-level directory containing the SConstruct
          file.

   _CPPDEFFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options to define values. The value
          of $_CPPDEFFLAGS is created by respectively prepending and
          appending $CPPDEFPREFIX and $CPPDEFSUFFIX to the beginning and
          end of each definition in $CPPDEFINES.

   CPPDEFINES
          A platform independent specification of C preprocessor
          definitions. The definitions will be added to command lines
          through the automatically-generated $_CPPDEFFLAGS construction
          variable (see above), which is constructed according to the type
          of value of $CPPDEFINES:

          If $CPPDEFINES is a string, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be respectively
          prepended and appended to the beginning and end of each
          definition in $CPPDEFINES.

# Will add -Dxyz to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /Dxyz to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES='xyz')

          If $CPPDEFINES is a list, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be respectively
          prepended and appended to the beginning and end of each element
          in the list. If any element is a list or tuple, then the first
          item is the name being defined and the second item is its value:

# Will add -DB=2 -DA to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DB=2 /DA to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('B', 2), 'A'])

          If $CPPDEFINES is a dictionary, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX
          and $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be respectively
          prepended and appended to the beginning and end of each item
          from the dictionary. The key of each dictionary item is a name
          being defined to the dictionary item's corresponding value; if
          the value is None, then the name is defined without an explicit
          value. Note that the resulting flags are sorted by keyword to
          ensure that the order of the options on the command line is
          consistent each time scons is run.

# Will add -DA -DB=2 to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DA /DB=2 to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES={'B':2, 'A':None})

   CPPDEFPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify preprocessor definitions on the C
          compiler command line. This will be prepended to the beginning
          of each definition in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable when
          the $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPDEFSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify preprocessor definitions on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          definition in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable when the
          $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPFLAGS
          User-specified C preprocessor options. These will be included in
          any command that uses the C preprocessor, including not just
          compilation of C and C++ source files via the [1189]$CCCOM,
          [1190]$SHCCCOM, [1191]$CXXCOM and [1192]$SHCXXCOM command lines,
          but also the [1193]$FORTRANPPCOM, [1194]$SHFORTRANPPCOM,
          [1195]$F77PPCOM and [1196]$SHF77PPCOM command lines used to
          compile a Fortran source file, and the [1197]$ASPPCOM command
          line used to assemble an assembly language source file, after
          first running each file through the C preprocessor. Note that
          this variable does not contain -I (or similar) include search
          path options that scons generates automatically from
          [1198]$CPPPATH. See [1199]$_CPPINCFLAGS, below, for the variable
          that expands to those options.

   _CPPINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files. The value of $_CPPINCFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending $INCPREFIX and
          $INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $CPPPATH.

   CPPPATH
          The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for
          include directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in CCFLAGS or CXXFLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          CPPPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory
          when they are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a
          directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(CPPPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(CPPPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_CPPINCFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending
          the value of the $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX construction
          variables to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $CPPPATH. Any command lines you define that need the CPPPATH
          directory list should include $_CPPINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(CCCOM="my_compiler $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   CPPSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for C
          preprocessor implicit dependencies (#include lines). The default
          list is:

[".c", ".C", ".cxx", ".cpp", ".c++", ".cc",
 ".h", ".H", ".hxx", ".hpp", ".hh",
 ".F", ".fpp", ".FPP",
 ".m", ".mm",
 ".S", ".spp", ".SPP"]

   CXX
          The C++ compiler. See also [1200]$SHCXX for compiling to shared
          objects..

   CXXCOM
          The command line used to compile a C++ source file to an object
          file. Any options specified in the [1201]$CXXFLAGS and
          [1202]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. See also [1203]$SHCXXCOM for compiling to shared
          objects..

   CXXCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a C++ source file is compiled
          to a (static) object file. If not set, then [1204]$CXXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed. See also [1205]$SHCXXCOMSTR for
          compiling to shared objects..

env = Environment(CXXCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C++ source files. This is used by the internal
          CXXFile builder when generating C++ files from Lex (.ll) or YACC
          (.yy) input files. The default suffix is .cc. SCons also treats
          files with the suffixes .cpp, .cxx, .c++, and .C++ as C++ files,
          and files with .mm suffixes as Objective C++ files. On
          case-sensitive systems (Linux, UNIX, and other POSIX-alikes),
          SCons also treats .C (upper case) files as C++ files.

   CXXFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C++ compiler. By default,
          this includes the value of [1206]$CCFLAGS, so that setting
          $CCFLAGS affects both C and C++ compilation. If you want to add
          C++-specific flags, you must set or override the value of
          [1207]$CXXFLAGS. See also [1208]$SHCXXFLAGS for compiling to
          shared objects..

   CXXVERSION
          The version number of the C++ compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C++ compiler being used.

   DC
          The D compiler to use. See also [1209]$SHDC for compiling to
          shared objects.

   DCOM
          The command line used to compile a D file to an object file. Any
          options specified in the [1210]$DFLAGS construction variable is
          included on this command line. See also [1211]$SHDCOM for
          compiling to shared objects.

   DCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a D source file is compiled to
          a (static) object file. If not set, then [1212]$DCOM (the
          command line) is displayed. See also [1213]$SHDCOMSTR for
          compiling to shared objects.

   DDEBUG
          List of debug tags to enable when compiling.

          converter.

   ENV
          A dictionary of environment variables to use when invoking
          commands. When $ENV is used in a command all list values will be
          joined using the path separator and any other non-string values
          will simply be coerced to a string. Note that, by default, scons
          does not propagate the environment in force when you execute
          scons to the commands used to build target files. This is so
          that builds will be guaranteed repeatable regardless of the
          environment variables set at the time scons is invoked.

          If you want to propagate your environment variables to the
          commands executed to build target files, you must do so
          explicitly:

import os
env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)

          Note that you can choose only to propagate certain environment
          variables. A common example is the system PATH environment
          variable, so that scons uses the same utilities as the invoking
          shell (or other process):

import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})

   ESCAPE
          A function that will be called to escape shell special
          characters in command lines. The function should take one
          argument: the command line string to escape; and should return
          the escaped command line.

   F03
          The Fortran 03 compiler. You should normally set the
          [1226]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [1227]$F03 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 03 files.

   F03COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 03 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1228]$F03COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 03 files. You should
          normally set the [1229]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F03COMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 03 source file is
          compiled to an object file. If not set, then [1230]$F03COM or
          [1231]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F03FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F03 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f03']

   F03FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 03
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [1232]$F03PATH. See [1233]$_F03INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1234]$F03FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 03 files. You should normally set the
          [1235]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F03INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 03 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [1236]$_F03INCFLAGS is created by appending [1237]$INCPREFIX and
          [1238]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1239]$F03PATH.

   F03PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 03 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1240]$F03FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1241]$F03PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use
          #: You only need to set [1242]$F03PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 03 files. You should normally
          set the [1243]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F03PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F03PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1244]$_F03INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [1245]$INCPREFIX and [1246]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [1247]$F03PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F03PATH directory list
          should include [1248]$_F03INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F03COM="my_compiler $_F03INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F03PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 03 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1249]$F03FLAGS and
          [1250]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [1251]$F03PPCOM if you need
          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 03
          files. You should normally set the [1252]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,
          which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F03PPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 03 source file is
          compiled to an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. If not set, then [1253]$F03PPCOM or
          [1254]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F03PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F03 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty.

   F08
          The Fortran 08 compiler. You should normally set the
          [1255]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [1256]$F08 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 08 files.

   F08COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 08 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1257]$F08COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 08 files. You should
          normally set the [1258]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F08COMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 08 source file is
          compiled to an object file. If not set, then [1259]$F08COM or
          [1260]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F08FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F08 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f08']

   F08FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 08
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [1261]$F08PATH. See [1262]$_F08INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1263]$F08FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 08 files. You should normally set the
          [1264]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F08INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 08 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [1265]$_F08INCFLAGS is created by appending [1266]$INCPREFIX and
          [1267]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1268]$F08PATH.

   F08PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 08 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1269]$F08FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1270]$F08PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use
          #: You only need to set [1271]$F08PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 08 files. You should normally
          set the [1272]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F08PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F08PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1273]$_F08INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [1274]$INCPREFIX and [1275]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [1276]$F08PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F08PATH directory list
          should include [1277]$_F08INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F08COM="my_compiler $_F08INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F08PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 08 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1278]$F08FLAGS and
          [1279]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [1280]$F08PPCOM if you need
          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 08
          files. You should normally set the [1281]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,
          which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F08PPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 08 source file is
          compiled to an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. If not set, then [1282]$F08PPCOM or
          [1283]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F08PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F08 dialect will be used. By default, this

          [1285]$F77 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 77 files.

   F77COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 77 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1286]$F77COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 77 files. You should
          normally set the [1287]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F77COMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 77 source file is
          compiled to an object file. If not set, then [1288]$F77COM or

          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [1290]$F77PATH. See [1291]$_F77INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1292]$F77FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 77 files. You should normally set the
          [1293]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

          The list of directories that the Fortran 77 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1298]$F77FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1299]$F77PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use
          #: You only need to set [1300]$F77PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 77 files. You should normally
          set the [1301]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

          [1308]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [1309]$F77PPCOM if you need
          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 77
          files. You should normally set the [1310]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,

          Fortran versions.

   F77PPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 77 source file is
          compiled to an object file after first running the file through

          automatically from [1319]$F90PATH. See [1320]$_F90INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1321]$F90FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 90 files. You should normally set the
          [1322]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   F90PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 90 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put

          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use
          #: You only need to set [1329]$F90PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 90 files. You should normally
          set the [1330]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F90PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F90PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the

          [1342]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [1343]$F95 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 95 files.

   F95COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 95 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1344]$F95COM if you need to

          need to set [1350]$F95FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 95 files. You should normally set the
          [1351]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified

          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 95
          files. You should normally set the [1368]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,
          which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F95PPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is

   FORTRANFLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include or module search path options that scons
          generates automatically from [1377]$FORTRANPATH. See
          [1378]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS and [1379]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, below, for
          the variables that expand those options.

   _FORTRANINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files and module files. The value of
          [1380]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS is created by respectively prepending
          and appending [1381]$INCPREFIX and [1382]$INCSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each directory in [1383]$FORTRANPATH.

   FORTRANMODDIR
          Directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files it generates. This variable is empty, by default.
          Some Fortran compilers will internally append this directory in
          the search path for module files, as well.

   FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be prepended to the beginning
          of the directory in the [1384]$FORTRANMODDIR construction
          variables when the [1385]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is
          automatically generated.

   FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of the
          directory in the [1386]$FORTRANMODDIR construction variables
          when the [1387]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is automatically
          generated.

   _FORTRANMODFLAG
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line option for specifying the
          directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files that happen to get generated during compilation.
          The value of [1388]$_FORTRANMODFLAG is created by respectively
          prepending and appending [1389]$FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX and
          [1390]$FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and end of the
          directory in [1391]$FORTRANMODDIR.

   FORTRANMODPREFIX
          The module file prefix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is left empty, by default. For situations
          in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal
          convention, the user may use this variable. Its value will be
          appended to every module file name as scons attempts to resolve
          dependencies.

   FORTRANMODSUFFIX
          The module file suffix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is set to ".mod", by default. For
          situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the
          normal convention, the user may use this variable. Its value
          will be appended to every module file name as scons attempts to
          resolve dependencies.

   FORTRANPATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran compiler will search
          for include files and (for some compilers) module files. The
          Fortran implicit dependency scanner will search these
          directories for include files (but not module files since they
          are autogenerated and, as such, may not actually exist at the
          time the scan takes place). Don't explicitly put include
          directory arguments in FORTRANFLAGS because the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. Note: directory names in FORTRANPATH will be
          looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are
          used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(FORTRANPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(FORTRANPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1392]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and
          appending the values of the [1393]$INCPREFIX and
          [1394]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end
          of each directory in [1395]$FORTRANPATH. Any command lines you
          define that need the FORTRANPATH directory list should include
          [1396]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(FORTRANCOM="my_compiler $_FORTRANINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURC
E")

   FORTRANPPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. By default, any options specified in the
          [1397]$FORTRANFLAGS, [1398]$CPPFLAGS, [1399]$_CPPDEFFLAGS,
          [1400]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and [1401]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variables are included on this command line.

   FORTRANPPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran source file is
          compiled to an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. If not set, then [1402]$FORTRANPPCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANPPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for FORTRAN dialect will be used. By default,
          this is ['.fpp', '.FPP']

   FORTRANSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for Fortran
          implicit dependencies (INCLUDE lines and USE statements). The
          default list is:

[".f", ".F", ".for", ".FOR", ".ftn", ".FTN", ".fpp", ".FPP",
".f77", ".F77", ".f90", ".F90", ".f95", ".F95"]

   FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list containing the paths to search for
          frameworks. Used by the compiler to find framework-style
          includes like #include <Fmwk/Header.h>. Used by the linker to
          find user-specified frameworks when linking (see
          [1403]$FRAMEWORKS). For example:

env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKPATH='#myframeworkdir')

          will add

... -Fmyframeworkdir

          to the compiler and linker command lines.

   _FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options
          corresponding to [1404]$FRAMEWORKPATH.

   FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for the
          FRAMEWORKPATH entries. (see [1405]$FRAMEWORKPATH). The default
          value is -F.

   FRAMEWORKPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for linking in
          frameworks (see [1406]$FRAMEWORKS). The default value is
          -framework.

   FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list of the framework names to be linked
          into a program or shared library or bundle. The default value is
          the empty list. For example:

env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKS=Split('System Cocoa SystemConfiguration'))

   _FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options for linking
          with FRAMEWORKS.

   FRAMEWORKSFLAGS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, general user-supplied frameworks options
          to be added at the end of a command line building a loadable
          module. (This has been largely superseded by the
          [1407]$FRAMEWORKPATH, [1408]$FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX,
          [1409]$FRAMEWORKPREFIX and [1410]$FRAMEWORKS variables described
          above.)

   GS
          The Ghostscript program used, e.g. to convert PostScript to PDF
          files.

   GSCOM
          The full Ghostscript command line used for the conversion
          process. Its default value is "$GS $GSFLAGS -sOutputFile=$TARGET
          $SOURCES".

   GSCOMSTR
          The string displayed when Ghostscript is called for the
          conversion process. If this is not set (the default), then
          [1411]$GSCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   GSFLAGS
          General options passed to the Ghostscript program, when
          converting PostScript to PDF files for example. Its default
          value is "-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite"

   HOST_ARCH
          The name of the host hardware architecture used to create the
          Environment. If a platform is specified when creating the
          Environment, then that Platform's logic will handle setting this
          value. This value is immutable, and should not be changed by the
          user after the Environment is initialized. Currently only set
          for Win32.

          Sets the host architecture for the Visual C++ compiler. If not
          set, default to the detected host architecture: note that this
          may depend on the python you are using. This variable must be
          passed as an argument to the Environment() constructor; setting
          it later has no effect.

          Valid values are the same as for [1412]$TARGET_ARCH.

          This is currently only used on Windows, but in the future it may
          be used on other OSes as well.

   HOST_OS
          The name of the host operating system used to create the
          Environment. If a platform is specified when creating the
          Environment, then that Platform's logic will handle setting this
          value. This value is immutable, and should not be changed by the
          user after the Environment is initialized. Currently only set
          for Win32.

   IDLSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for IDL
          implicit dependencies (#include or import lines). The default
          list is:

[".idl", ".IDL"]

   IMPLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          Used to override
          [1413]$SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS/[1414]$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          when creating versioned import library for a shared
          library/loadable module. If not defined, then
          [1415]$SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS/[1416]$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          is used to determine whether to disable symlink generation or
          not.

   IMPLIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for import library names. For example, cygwin
          uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in pair with dynamic
          libraries (cygfoo.dll). The [1417]cyglink linker sets
          [1418]$IMPLIBPREFIX to 'lib' and [1419]$SHLIBPREFIX to 'cyg'.

   IMPLIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for import library names. For example, cygwin
          uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in pair with dynamic
          libraries (cygfoo.dll). The [1420]cyglink linker sets
          [1421]$IMPLIBSUFFIX to '.dll.a' and [1422]$SHLIBSUFFIX to
          '.dll'.

   IMPLIBVERSION
          Used to override [1423]$SHLIBVERSION/[1424]$LDMODULEVERSION when
          generating versioned import library for a shared
          library/loadable module. If undefined, the
          [1425]$SHLIBVERSION/[1426]$LDMODULEVERSION is used to determine
          the version of versioned import library.

   IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES
          Controls whether or not SCons will add implicit dependencies for
          the commands executed to build targets.

          By default, SCons will add to each target an implicit dependency
          on the command represented by the first argument of any command
          line it executes (which is typically the command itself). By
          setting such a dependency, SCons can determine that a target
          should be rebuilt if the command changes, such as when a
          compiler is upgraded to a new version. The specific file for the
          dependency is found by searching the PATH variable in the ENV
          dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the
          command. The default is the same as setting the construction
          variable $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES to a True-like value
          ("true", "yes", or "1" - but not a number greater than one, as
          that has a different meaning).

          Action strings can be segmented by the use of an AND operator,
          &&. In a segemented string, each segment is a separate "command
          line", these are run sequentially until one fails or the entire
          sequence has been executed. If an action string is segmented,
          then the selected behavior of $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is
          applied to each segment.

          If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to a False-like value
          ("none", "false", "no", "0", etc.), then the implicit dependency
          will not be added to the targets built with that construction
          environment.

          If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to "2" or higher, then
          that number of arguments in the command line will be scanned for
          relative or absolute paths. If any are present, they will be
          added as implicit dependencies to the targets built with that
          construction environment. The first argument in the command line
          will be searched for using the PATH variable in the ENV
          dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the
          command. The other arguments will only be found if they are
          absolute paths or valid paths relative to the working directory.

          If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to "all", then all
          arguments in the command line will be scanned for relative or
          absolute paths. If any are present, they will be added as
          implicit dependencies to the targets built with that
          construction environment. The first argument in the command line
          will be searched for using the PATH variable in the ENV
          dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the
          command. The other arguments will only be found if they are
          absolute paths or valid paths relative to the working directory.

env = Environment(IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES=False)

   INCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be prepended to the beginning
          of each directory in the $CPPPATH and $FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the $_CPPINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables
          are automatically generated.

   INCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          directory in the $CPPPATH and $FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the $_CPPINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables
          are automatically generated.

   INSTALL
          A function to be called to install a file into a destination
          file name. The default function copies the file into the
          destination (and sets the destination file's mode and permission
          bits to match the source file's). The function takes the
          following arguments:

def install(dest, source, env):

          dest is the path name of the destination file. source is the
          path name of the source file. env is the construction
          environment (a dictionary of construction values) in force for
          this file installation.

   INSTALLSTR
          The string displayed when a file is installed into a destination
          file name. The default is:

Install file: "$SOURCE" as "$TARGET"

   INTEL_C_COMPILER_VERSION
          Set by the "intelc" Tool to the major version number of the
          Intel C compiler selected for use.

   JAR
          The Java archive tool.

   JARCHDIR
          The directory to which the Java archive tool should change
          (using the -C option).

   JARCOM
          The command line used to call the Java archive tool.

   JARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when the Java archive tool is called If
          this is not set, then [1427]$JARCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

env = Environment(JARCOMSTR="JARchiving $SOURCES into $TARGET")

   JARFLAGS
          General options passed to the Java archive tool. By default this
          is set to cf to create the necessary jar file.

   JARSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java archives: .jar by default.

   JAVABOOTCLASSPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be added to the
          javac command line via the -bootclasspath option. The individual
          directory names will be separated by the operating system's path
          separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on Windows).

   JAVAC
          The Java compiler.

   JAVACCOM
          The command line used to compile a directory tree containing
          Java source files to corresponding Java class files. Any options
          specified in the [1428]$JAVACFLAGS construction variable are
          included on this command line.

   JAVACCOMSTR
          The string displayed when compiling a directory tree of Java
          source files to corresponding Java class files. If this is not
          set, then [1429]$JAVACCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVACCOMSTR="Compiling class files $TARGETS from $SOURCES")

   JAVACFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the Java compiler.

   JAVACLASSDIR
          The directory in which Java class files may be found. This is
          stripped from the beginning of any Java .class file names
          supplied to the JavaH builder.

   JAVACLASSPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for Java
          .class file. The directories in this list will be added to the
          javac and javah command lines via the -classpath option. The
          individual directory names will be separated by the operating
          system's path separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on
          Windows).

          Note that this currently just adds the specified directory via
          the -classpath option. SCons does not currently search the
          $JAVACLASSPATH directories for dependency .class files.

   JAVACLASSSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java class files; .class by default.

   JAVAH
          The Java generator for C header and stub files.

   JAVAHCOM
          The command line used to generate C header and stub files from
          Java classes. Any options specified in the [1430]$JAVAHFLAGS
          construction variable are included on this command line.

   JAVAHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when C header and stub files are generated
          from Java classes. If this is not set, then [1431]$JAVAHCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVAHCOMSTR="Generating header/stub file(s) $TARGETS from $SOU
RCES")

   JAVAHFLAGS
          General options passed to the C header and stub file generator
          for Java classes.

   JAVAINCLUDES
          Include path for Java header files (such as jni.h)

   JAVASOURCEPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for
          input .java file. The directories in this list will be added to
          the javac command line via the -sourcepath option. The
          individual directory names will be separated by the operating
          system's path separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on
          Windows).

          Note that this currently just adds the specified directory via
          the -sourcepath option. SCons does not currently search the
          $JAVASOURCEPATH directories for dependency .java files.

   JAVASUFFIX
          The suffix for Java files; .java by default.

   JAVAVERSION
          Specifies the Java version being used by the Java builder. This
          is not currently used to select one version of the Java compiler
          vs. another. Instead, you should set this to specify the version
          of Java supported by your javac compiler. The default is 1.4.

          This is sometimes necessary because Java 1.5 changed the file
          names that are created for nested anonymous inner classes, which
          can cause a mismatch with the files that SCons expects will be
          generated by the javac compiler. Setting $JAVAVERSION to 1.5 (or
          1.6, as appropriate) can make SCons realize that a Java 1.5 or
          1.6 build is actually up to date.

   LATEX
          The LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   LATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter. If this is not set, then [1432]$LATEXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LATEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES")

   LATEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXRETRIES
          The maximum number of times that LaTeX will be re-run if the
          .log generated by the [1433]$LATEXCOM command indicates that
          there are undefined references. The default is to try to resolve
          undefined references by re-running LaTeX up to three times.

   LATEXSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for LaTeX
          implicit dependencies (\include or \import files). The default
          list is:

[".tex", ".ltx", ".latex"]

   LDMODULE
          The linker for building loadable modules. By default, this is
          the same as [1434]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOM
          The command line for building loadable modules. On Mac OS X,
          this uses the [1435]$LDMODULE, [1436]$LDMODULEFLAGS and
          [1437]$FRAMEWORKSFLAGS variables. On other systems, this is the
          same as [1438]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when building loadable modules. If
          not set, then [1439]$LDMODULECOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   LDMODULEEMITTER
          Contains the emitter specification for the [1440]LoadableModule
          builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general
          information on specifying emitters.

   LDMODULEFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker for building loadable
          modules.

   LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          Instructs the [1441]LoadableModule builder to not automatically
          create symlinks for versioned modules. Defaults to
          $SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS

   LDMODULEPREFIX
          The prefix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          [1442]$SHLIBPREFIX.

   _LDMODULESONAME
          A macro that automatically generates loadable module's SONAME
          based on $TARGET, $LDMODULEVERSION and $LDMODULESUFFIX. Used by
          [1443]LoadableModule builder when the linker tool supports
          SONAME (e.g. [1444]gnulink).

   LDMODULESUFFIX
          The suffix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          $SHLIBSUFFIX.

   LDMODULEVERSION
          When this construction variable is defined, a versioned loadable
          module is created by [1445]LoadableModule builder. This
          activates the [1446]$_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS and thus modifies the
          [1447]$LDMODULECOM as required, adds the version number to the
          library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed.
          [1448]$LDMODULEVERSION versions should exist in the same format
          as [1449]$SHLIBVERSION.

   _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          This macro automatically introduces extra flags to
          [1450]$LDMODULECOM when building versioned [1451]LoadableModule
          (that is when [1452]$LDMODULEVERSION is set).
          _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS usually adds [1453]$SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and
          some extra dynamically generated options (such as
          -Wl,-soname=$_LDMODULESONAME). It is unused by plain
          (unversioned) loadable modules.

   LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          Extra flags added to [1454]$LDMODULECOM when building versioned
          [1455]LoadableModule. These flags are only used when
          [1456]$LDMODULEVERSION is set.

   LEX
          The lexical analyzer generator.

   LEXCOM
          The command line used to call the lexical analyzer generator to
          generate a source file.

   LEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          lexical analyzer generator. If this is not set, then
          [1457]$LEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LEXCOMSTR = "Lex'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   LEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the lexical analyzer generator.

   LEXUNISTD
          Used only on windows environments to set a lex flag to prevent
          'unistd.h' from being included. The default value is
          '--nounistd'.

   _LIBDIRFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for library. The value of $_LIBDIRFLAGS is created by
          respectively prepending and appending $LIBDIRPREFIX and
          $LIBDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $LIBPATH.

   LIBDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be prepended to the beginning of each
          directory in the $LIBPATH construction variable when the
          $_LIBDIRFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   LIBDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each directory
          in the $LIBPATH construction variable when the $_LIBDIRFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBEMITTER
          Contains the emitter specification for the [1458]StaticLibrary
          builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general
          information on specifying emitters.

   _LIBFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying libraries to be
          linked with the resulting target. The value of $_LIBFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending $LIBLINKPREFIX
          and $LIBLINKSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each filename in
          $LIBS.

   LIBLINKPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be prepended to the beginning of each
          library in the $LIBS construction variable when the $_LIBFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBLINKSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each library
          in the $LIBS construction variable when the $_LIBFLAGS variable
          is automatically generated.

   LIBPATH
          The list of directories that will be searched for libraries. The
          implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for
          include files. Don't explicitly put include directory arguments
          in $LINKFLAGS or $SHLINKFLAGS because the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. Note: directory names in LIBPATH will be
          looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are
          used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(LIBPATH='#/libs')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

libs = Dir('libs')
env = Environment(LIBPATH=libs)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_LIBDIRFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending
          the values of the $LIBDIRPREFIX and $LIBDIRSUFFIX construction
          variables to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $LIBPATH. Any command lines you define that need the LIBPATH
          directory list should include $_LIBDIRFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

   LIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBPREFIXES
          A list of all legal prefixes for library file names. When
          searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files
          with these prefixes, the base library name, and suffixes in the
          $LIBSUFFIXES list.

   LIBS
          A list of one or more libraries that will be linked with any
          executable programs created by this environment.

          The library list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_LIBFLAGS construction variable, which
          is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the
          values of the $LIBLINKPREFIX and $LIBLINKSUFFIX construction
          variables to the beginning and end of each filename in $LIBS.
          Any command lines you define that need the LIBS library list
          should include $_LIBFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

          If you add a File object to the $LIBS list, the name of that
          file will be added to $_LIBFLAGS, and thus the link line, as is,
          without $LIBLINKPREFIX or $LIBLINKSUFFIX. For example:

env.Append(LIBS=File('/tmp/mylib.so'))

          In all cases, scons will add dependencies from the executable
          program to all the libraries in this list.

   LIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBSUFFIXES
          A list of all legal suffixes for library file names. When
          searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files
          with prefixes, in the $LIBPREFIXES list, the base library name,
          and these suffixes.

   LINESEPARATOR
          The separator used by the [1459]Substfile and [1460]Textfile
          builders. This value is used between sources when constructing
          the target. It defaults to the current system line separator.

          linguas to be processed by [1461]POInit, [1462]POUpdate or
          [1463]MOFiles builders. It also affects [1464]Translate builder.
          If the variable contains a string, it defines name of the list
          file. The $LINGUAS_FILE may be a list of file names as well. If
          $LINGUAS_FILE is set to True (or non-zero numeric value), the
          list will be read from default file named LINGUAS.

          with the libraries listed in [1469]$LIBS, nor -L (or similar)
          library search path options that scons generates automatically
          from [1470]$LIBPATH. See [1471]$_LIBFLAGS above, for the
          variable that expands to library-link options, and
          [1472]$_LIBDIRFLAGS above, for the variable that expands to
          library search path options. See also [1473]$SHLINKFLAGS. for
          linking shared objects.

          [1475]$MAKEINDEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   MAKEINDEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the makeindex generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   MAXLINELENGTH
          The maximum number of characters allowed on an external command
          line. On Win32 systems, link lines longer than this many

   MSSDK_DIR
          The directory containing the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK
          or Windows SDK) to be used for compilation.

   MSSDK_VERSION
          The version string of the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK or
          Windows SDK) to be used for compilation. Supported versions
          include 6.1, 6.0A, 6.0, 2003R2 and 2003R1.

   MSVC_BATCH
          When set to any true value, specifies that SCons should batch
          compilation of object files when calling the Microsoft Visual
          C/C++ compiler. All compilations of source files from the same
          source directory that generate target files in a same output
          directory and were configured in SCons using the same
          construction environment will be built in a single call to the
          compiler. Only source files that have changed since their object
          files were built will be passed to each compiler invocation (via
          the [1508]$CHANGED_SOURCES construction variable). Any
          compilations where the object (target) file base name (minus the
          .obj) does not match the source file base name will be compiled
          separately.

   MSVC_USE_SCRIPT
          Use a batch script to set up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

          If set to the name of a Visual Studio .bat file (e.g.
          vcvars.bat), SCons will run that batch file instead of the
          auto-detected one, and extract the relevant variables from the
          result (typically %INCLUDE%, %LIB%, and %PATH%) for supplying to
          the build. This can be useful to force the use of a compiler
          version that SCons does not detect.

          Setting $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT to None bypasses the Visual Studio
          autodetection entirely; use this if you are running SCons in a
          Visual Studio cmd window and importing the shell's environment
          variables - that is, if you are sure everything is set correctly
          already and you don't want SCons to change anything.

          $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT overrides [1509]$MSVC_VERSION and
          [1510]$TARGET_ARCH.

   MSVC_UWP_APP
          Build libraries for a Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
          Application.

          If $MSVC_UWP_APP is set, the Visual C++ environment will be set
          up to point to the Windows Store compatible libraries and Visual
          C++ runtimes. In doing so, any libraries that are built will be
          able to be used in a UWP App and published to the Windows Store.
          This flag will only have an effect with Visual Studio 2015 or
          later. This variable must be passed as an argument to the
          Environment() constructor; setting it later has no effect.

          Valid values are '1' or '0'

   MSVC_VERSION
          Sets the preferred version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ to use.

          If $MSVC_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the
          latest version of Visual C/C++ installed on your system. If the
          specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will
          fail. This variable must be passed as an argument to the
          [1511]Environment constructor; setting it later has no effect.

          Valid values for Windows are 14.2, 14.1, 14.1Exp, 14.0, 14.0Exp,
          12.0, 12.0Exp, 11.0, 11.0Exp, 10.0, 10.0Exp, 9.0, 9.0Exp, 8.0,
          8.0Exp, 7.1, 7.0, and 6.0. Versions ending in Exp refer to
          "Express" or "Express for Desktop" editions.

   MSVS
          When the Microsoft Visual Studio tools are initialized, they set
          up this dictionary with the following keys:

        VERSION
                the version of MSVS being used (can be set via
                [1512]$MSVS_VERSION)

        VERSIONS
                the available versions of MSVS installed

        VCINSTALLDIR
                installed directory of Visual C++

        VSINSTALLDIR
                installed directory of Visual Studio

        FRAMEWORKDIR
                installed directory of the .NET framework

        FRAMEWORKVERSIONS
                list of installed versions of the .NET framework, sorted
                latest to oldest.

        FRAMEWORKVERSION
                latest installed version of the .NET framework

        FRAMEWORKSDKDIR
                installed location of the .NET SDK.

        PLATFORMSDKDIR
                installed location of the Platform SDK.

        PLATFORMSDK_MODULES
                dictionary of installed Platform SDK modules, where the
                dictionary keys are keywords for the various modules, and
                the values are 2-tuples where the first is the release
                date, and the second is the version number.

          If a value is not set, it was not available in the registry.

   MSVS_ARCH
          Sets the architecture for which the generated project(s) should
          build.

          The default value is x86. amd64 is also supported by SCons for
          most Visual Studio versions. Since Visual Studio 2015 arm is
          supported, and since Visual Studio 2017 arm64 is supported.
          Trying to set $MSVS_ARCH to an architecture that's not supported
          for a given Visual Studio version will generate an error.

   MSVS_PROJECT_GUID
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          file as the value of the ProjectGUID attribute. There is no
          default value. If not defined, a new GUID is generated.

   MSVS_SCC_AUX_PATH
          The path name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccAuxPath attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. There is no
          default value.

   MSVS_SCC_CONNECTION_ROOT
          The root path of projects in your SCC workspace, i.e the path
          under which all project and solution files will be generated. It
          is used as a reference path from which the relative paths of the
          generated Microsoft Visual Studio project and solution files are
          computed. The relative project file path is placed as the value
          of the SccLocalPath attribute of the project file and as the
          values of the SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection[i]
          (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of projects in the
          solution) attributes of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl)
          section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. Similarly
          the relative solution file path is placed as the values of the
          SccLocalPath[i] (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of
          projects in the solution) attributes of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. This is used only if the MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER
          construction variable is also set. The default value is the
          current working directory.

   MSVS_SCC_PROJECT_NAME
          The project name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccProjectName attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. In this
          case the string is also placed in the SccProjectName0 attribute
          of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft
          Visual Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          file as the value of the SccProvider attribute. The string is
          also placed in the SccProvider0 attribute of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_VERSION
          Sets the preferred version of Microsoft Visual Studio to use.

          If $MSVS_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the
          latest version of Visual Studio installed on your system. So, if
          you have version 6 and version 7 (MSVS .NET) installed, it will
          prefer version 7. You can override this by specifying the
          MSVS_VERSION variable in the Environment initialization, setting
          it to the appropriate version ('6.0' or '7.0', for example). If
          the specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will
          fail.

          This is obsolete: use $MSVC_VERSION instead. If $MSVS_VERSION is
          set and $MSVC_VERSION is not, $MSVC_VERSION will be set
          automatically to $MSVS_VERSION. If both are set to different
          values, scons will raise an error.

   MSVSBUILDCOM
          The build command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified build targets.

   MSVSCLEANCOM
          The clean command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with the -c option to remove any specified targets.

   MSVSENCODING
          The encoding string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is encoding Windows-1252.

   MSVSPROJECTCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files.

   MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio project (DSP) files.
          The default value is .vcproj when using Visual Studio version
          7.x (.NET) or later version, and .dsp when using earlier
          versions of Visual Studio.

   MSVSREBUILDCOM
          The rebuild command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified rebuild targets.

   MSVSSCONS
          The SCons used in generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files. The default is the version of SCons being used to
          generate the project file.

   MSVSSCONSCOM
          The default SCons command used in generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project files.

   MSVSSCONSCRIPT
          The sconscript file (that is, SConstruct or SConscript file)
          that will be invoked by Visual Studio project files (through the
          [1513]$MSVSSCONSCOM variable). The default is the same
          sconscript file that contains the call to MSVSProject to build
          the project file.

   MSVSSCONSFLAGS
          The SCons flags used in generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio solution
          files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio solution (DSW)
          files. The default value is .sln when using Visual Studio
          version 7.x (.NET), and .dsw when using earlier versions of
          Visual Studio.

   MT
          The program used on Windows systems to embed manifests into DLLs
          and EXEs. See also [1514]$WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST.

   MTEXECOM

          (Windows only).

   MTSHLIBCOM
          The Windows command line used to embed manifests into shared
          libraries (DLLs). See also [1517]$MTEXECOM.

   MWCW_VERSION
          The version number of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C compiler to
          be used.

   MWCW_VERSIONS

          compiler on this system.

   NAME
          Specfies the name of the project to package.

   no_import_lib
          When set to non-zero, suppresses creation of a corresponding
          Windows static import lib by the SharedLibrary builder when used
          with MinGW, Microsoft Visual Studio or Metrowerks. This also
          suppresses creation of an export (.exp) file when using
          Microsoft Visual Studio.

   OBJPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) object file names.

   OBJSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) object file names.

   PACKAGEROOT
          Specifies the directory where all files in resulting archive
          will be placed if applicable. The default value is
          "$NAME-$VERSION".

   PACKAGETYPE
          Selects the package type to build when using the [1518]Package
          builder. May be a string or list of strings. See the
          docuentation for the builder for the currently supported types.

          $PACKAGETYPE may be overridden with the --package-type command
          line option.

   PACKAGEVERSION
          The version of the package (not the underlying project). This is
          currently only used by the rpm packager and should reflect
          changes in the packaging, not the underlying project code
          itself.

   PCH
          The Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header that will be used
          when compiling object files. This variable is ignored by tools
          other than Microsoft Visual C++. When this variable is defined
          SCons will add options to the compiler command line to cause it
          to use the precompiled header, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PCH file. Example:

env['PCH'] = 'StdAfx.pch'

   PCHCOM
          The command line used by the [1519]PCH builder to generated a
          precompiled header.

   PCHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a precompiled header. If
          this is not set, then [1520]$PCHCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   PCHPDBFLAGS
          A construction variable that, when expanded, adds the /yD flag
          to the command line only if the [1521]$PDB construction variable
          is set.

   PCHSTOP
          This variable specifies how much of a source file is
          precompiled. This variable is ignored by tools other than
          Microsoft Visual C++, or when the PCH variable is not being
          used. When this variable is define it must be a string that is
          the name of the header that is included at the end of the
          precompiled portion of the source files, or the empty string if
          the "#pragma hrdstop" construct is being used:

env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'

   PDB
          The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging
          information for object files, shared libraries, and programs.
          This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual
          C++. When this variable is defined SCons will add options to the
          compiler and linker command line to cause them to generate
          external debugging information, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PDB file. Example:

env['PDB'] = 'hello.pdb'

          The Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default to
          generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with
          parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in
          the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single
          PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only
          way to get debug information embedded into a static library.
          Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance,
          although parallel builds will no longer work. You can generate
          PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the default
          [1522]$CCPDBFLAGS variable; see the entry for that variable for
          specific examples.

   PDFCOM
          A deprecated synonym for [1523]$DVIPDFCOM.

   PDFLATEX
          The pdflatex utility.

   PDFLATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the pdflatex utility.

   PDFLATEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the pdflatex utility. If this
          is not set, then [1524]$PDFLATEXCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

env = Environment(PDFLATEX;COMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES"
)

   PDFLATEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the pdflatex utility.

   PDFPREFIX
          The prefix used for PDF file names.

   PDFTEXCOM
          The command line used to call the pdftex utility.

   PDFTEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the pdftex utility. If this is
          not set, then [1525]$PDFTEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(PDFTEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

   PDFTEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the pdftex utility.

   PKGCHK
          On Solaris systems, the package-checking program that will be
          used (along with $PKGINFO) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is /usr/sbin/pgkchk.

   PKGINFO
          On Solaris systems, the package information program that will be
          used (along with $PKGCHK) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is pkginfo.

   PLATFORM
          The name of the platform used to create the Environment. If no
          platform is specified when the Environment is created, scons
          autodetects the platform.

env = Environment(tools = [])
if env['PLATFORM'] == 'cygwin':
    Tool('mingw')(env)
else:
    Tool('msvc')(env)

   POAUTOINIT
          The $POAUTOINIT variable, if set to True (on non-zero numeric
          value), let the [1526]msginit tool to automatically initialize
          missing PO files with msginit(1). This applies to both,
          [1527]POInit and [1528]POUpdate builders (and others that use
          any of them).

   POCREATE_ALIAS
          Common alias for all PO files created with POInit builder
          (default: 'po-create'). See [1529]msginit tool and [1530]POInit
          builder.

   POSUFFIX
          Suffix used for PO files (default: '.po') See [1531]msginit tool
          and [1532]POInit builder.

   POTDOMAIN
          The $POTDOMAIN defines default domain, used to generate POT
          filename as $POTDOMAIN.pot when no POT file name is provided by
          the user. This applies to [1533]POTUpdate, [1534]POInit and
          [1535]POUpdate builders (and builders, that use them, e.g.
          Translate). Normally (if $POTDOMAIN is not defined), the
          builders use messages.pot as default POT file name.

   POTSUFFIX
          Suffix used for PO Template files (default: '.pot'). See
          [1536]xgettext tool and [1537]POTUpdate builder.

   POTUPDATE_ALIAS
          Name of the common phony target for all PO Templates created
          with [1538]POUpdate (default: 'pot-update'). See [1539]xgettext
          tool and [1540]POTUpdate builder.

   POUPDATE_ALIAS
          Common alias for all PO files being defined with [1541]POUpdate
          builder (default: 'po-update'). See [1542]msgmerge tool and
          [1543]POUpdate builder.

   PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC
          A Python function used to print the command lines as they are
          executed (assuming command printing is not disabled by the -q or
          -s options or their equivalents). The function should take four
          arguments: s, the command being executed (a string), target, the
          target being built (file node, list, or string name(s)), source,
          the source(s) used (file node, list, or string name(s)), and
          env, the environment being used.

          The function must do the printing itself. The default
          implementation, used if this variable is not set or is None, is:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
  sys.stdout.write(s + "\n")

          Here's an example of a more interesting function:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
   sys.stdout.write("Building %s -> %s...\n" %
    (' and '.join([str(x) for x in source]),
     ' and '.join([str(x) for x in target])))
env=Environment(PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC=print_cmd_line)
env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

          This just prints "Building targetname from sourcename..."
          instead of the actual commands. Such a function could also log
          the actual commands to a log file, for example.

   PROGEMITTER
          Contains the emitter specification for the [1544]Program
          builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general
          information on specifying emitters.

   PROGPREFIX
          The prefix used for executable file names.

   PROGSUFFIX
          The suffix used for executable file names.

          file.

   PSCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a TeX DVI file is converted into a
          PostScript file. If this is not set, then [1545]$PSCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   PSPREFIX
          The prefix used for PostScript file names.

   PSSUFFIX
          The prefix used for PostScript file names.

          value is '[1547]$QTDIR/include'. Note: If you set this variable
          to None, the tool won't change the [1548]$CPPPATH construction
          variable.

   QT_DEBUG
          Prints lots of debugging information while scanning for moc
          files.

   QT_LIB
          Default value is 'qt'. You may want to set this to 'qt-mt'.

          the [1549]$LIBS variable.

   QT_LIBPATH
          The path where the qt libraries are installed. The default value
          is '[1550]$QTDIR/lib'. Note: If you set this variable to None,

          line) is displayed.

   QT_MOCFROMCXXFLAGS
          Default value is '-i'. These flags are passed to moc, when
          moccing a C++ file.

   QT_MOCFROMHCOM
          Command to generate a moc file from a header.

   QT_MOCFROMHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a moc file from a cpp file.
          If this is not set, then [1554]$QT_MOCFROMHCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

   QTDIR
          The qt tool tries to take this from os.environ. It also
          initializes all QT_* construction variables listed below. (Note
          that all paths are constructed with python's os.path.join()
          method, but are listed here with the '/' separator for easier
          reading.) In addition, the construction environment variables
          [1559]$CPPPATH, [1560]$LIBPATH and [1561]$LIBS may be modified
          and the variables [1562]$PROGEMITTER, [1563]$SHLIBEMITTER and
          [1564]$LIBEMITTER are modified. Because the build-performance is
          affected when using this tool, you have to explicitly specify it
          at Environment creation:

Environment(tools=['default','qt'])

          The qt tool supports the following operations:

          Automatic moc file generation from header files. You do not have
          to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you.
          However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header
          file must have the same filebase as your implementation file and
          must stay in the same directory. It must have one of the
          suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You can turn off automatic moc
          file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0. See also the
          corresponding Moc() builder method.

          Automatic moc file generation from cxx files. As stated in the
          qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of the cxx
          file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated
          by the transformation
          ${QT_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
          <basename>.moc. A warning is generated after building the moc
          file, if you do not include the correct file. If you are using
          VariantDir, you may need to specify duplicate=1. You can turn
          off automatic moc file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0.
          See also the corresponding Moc builder method.

          Automatic handling of .ui files. The implementation files
          generated from .ui files are handled much the same as yacc or
          lex files. Each .ui file given as a source of Program, Library
          or SharedLibrary will generate three files, the declaration
          file, the implementation file and a moc file. Because there are
          also generated headers, you may need to specify duplicate=1 in
          calls to VariantDir. See also the corresponding Uic builder
          method.

   RANLIB
          The archive indexer.

   RANLIBCOM
          The command line used to index a static library archive.

   RANLIBCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a static library archive is indexed.
          If this is not set, then [1565]$RANLIBCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

env = Environment(RANLIBCOMSTR = "Indexing $TARGET")

   RANLIBFLAGS
          General options passed to the archive indexer.

   RCINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          command-line options for specifying directories to be searched
          by the resource compiler. The value of $RCINCFLAGS is created by
          respectively prepending and appending [1567]$RCINCPREFIX and
          [1568]$RCINCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1569]$CPPPATH.

   RCINCPREFIX
          The prefix (flag) used to specify an include directory on the
          resource compiler command line. This will be prepended to the
          beginning of each directory in the [1570]$CPPPATH construction
          variable when the [1571]$RCINCFLAGS variable is expanded.

   RCINCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the resource
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          directory in the [1572]$CPPPATH construction variable when the
          [1573]$RCINCFLAGS variable is expanded.

   RDirs
          A function that converts a string into a list of Dir instances
          by searching the repositories.

   REGSVR
          The program used on Windows systems to register a newly-built
          DLL library whenever the SharedLibrary builder is passed a
          keyword argument of register=1.

   REGSVRCOM
          The command line used on Windows systems to register a
          newly-built DLL library whenever the SharedLibrary builder is
          passed a keyword argument of register=1.

   REGSVRCOMSTR
          The string displayed when registering a newly-built DLL file. If
          this is not set, then [1574]$REGSVRCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   REGSVRFLAGS
          Flags passed to the DLL registration program on Windows systems
          when a newly-built DLL library is registered. By default, this
          includes the /s that prevents dialog boxes from popping up and
          requiring user attention.

   RMIC
          The Java RMI stub compiler.

   RMICCOM
          The command line used to compile stub and skeleton class files
          from Java classes that contain RMI implementations. Any options
          specified in the [1575]$RMICFLAGS construction variable are
          included on this command line.

   RMICCOMSTR
          The string displayed when compiling stub and skeleton class
          files from Java classes that contain RMI implementations. If
          this is not set, then [1576]$RMICCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

env = Environment(RMICCOMSTR = "Generating stub/skeleton class files $TARGETS fr
om $SOURCES")

   RMICFLAGS
          General options passed to the Java RMI stub compiler.

   RPATH
          A list of paths to search for shared libraries when running
          programs. Currently only used in the GNU (gnulink), IRIX
          (sgilink) and Sun (sunlink) linkers. Ignored on platforms and
          toolchains that don't support it. Note that the paths added to
          RPATH are not transformed by scons in any way: if you want an
          absolute path, you must make it absolute yourself.

   _RPATH
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          rpath flags to be used when linking a program with shared
          libraries. The value of $_RPATH is created by respectively
          prepending $RPATHPREFIX and appending $RPATHSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each directory in $RPATH.

   RPATHPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared
          libraries when running programs. This will be prepended to the
          beginning of each directory in the $RPATH construction variable
          when the $_RPATH variable is automatically generated.

   RPATHSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared
          libraries when running programs. This will be appended to the
          end of each directory in the $RPATH construction variable when
          the $_RPATH variable is automatically generated.

   RPCGEN
          The RPC protocol compiler.

   RPCGENCLIENTFLAGS
          Options passed to the RPC protocol compiler when generating
          client side stubs. These are in addition to any flags specified
          in the [1577]$RPCGENFLAGS construction variable.

   RPCGENFLAGS
          General options passed to the RPC protocol compiler.

   RPCGENHEADERFLAGS

          [1704]$_LIBFLAGS above, for the variable that expands to
          library-link options, and [1705]$_LIBDIRFLAGS above, for the
          variable that expands to library search path options. See also
          [1706]$LINKFLAGS for linking static objects.

   SHOBJPREFIX
          The prefix used for shared object file names.

   SHOBJSUFFIX
          The suffix used for shared object file names.

   SONAME
          Variable used to hard-code SONAME for versioned shared
          library/loadable module.

env.SharedLibrary('test', 'test.c', SHLIBVERSION='0.1.2', SONAME='libtest.so.2')

          The variable is used, for example, by [1707]gnulink linker tool.

   SOURCE
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   SOURCE_URL
          The URL (web address) of the location from which the project was
          retrieved. This is used to fill in the Source: field in the
          controlling information for Ipkg and RPM packages.

   SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   SOVERSION
          This will construct the SONAME using on the base library name
          (test in the example below) and use specified SOVERSION to
          create SONAME.

env.SharedLibrary('test', 'test.c', SHLIBVERSION='0.1.2', SOVERSION='2')

          The variable is used, for example, by [1708]gnulink linker tool.

          In the example above SONAME would be libtest.so.2 which would be
          a symlink and point to libtest.so.0.1.2

   SPAWN
          A command interpreter function that will be called to execute
          command line strings. The function must expect the following
          arguments:

def spawn(shell, escape, cmd, args, env):

          sh is a string naming the shell program to use. escape is a
          function that can be called to escape shell special characters
          in the command line. cmd is the path to the command to be
          executed. args is the arguments to the command. env is a
          dictionary of the environment variables in which the command
          should be executed.

   STATIC_AND_SHARED_OBJECTS_ARE_THE_SAME
          When this variable is true, static objects and shared objects
          are assumed to be the same; that is, SCons does not check for
          linking static objects into a shared library.

   SUBST_DICT
          The dictionary used by the [1709]Substfile or [1710]Textfile
          builders for substitution values. It can be anything acceptable
          to the dict() constructor, so in addition to a dictionary, lists
          of tuples are also acceptable.

   SUBSTFILEPREFIX
          The prefix used for [1711]Substfile file names, an empty string
          by default.

   SUBSTFILESUFFIX
          The suffix used for [1712]Substfile file names, an empty string
          by default.

   SUMMARY
          A short summary of what the project is about. This is used to
          fill in the Summary: field in the controlling information for
          Ipkg and RPM packages, and as the Description: field in MSI
          packages.

   SWIG
          The scripting language wrapper and interface generator.

   SWIGCFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C source files
          generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface
          generator. The default value is _wrap[1713]$CFILESUFFIX. By
          default, this value is used whenever the -c++ option is not
          specified as part of the [1714]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGCOM
          The command line used to call the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generator.

   SWIGCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the scripting language wrapper
          and interface generator. If this is not set, then [1715]$SWIGCOM
          (the command line) is displayed.

   SWIGCXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ source files
          generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface
          generator. The default value is _wrap[1716]$CFILESUFFIX. By
          default, this value is used whenever the -c++ option is
          specified as part of the [1717]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGDIRECTORSUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ header files
          generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface
          generator. These are only generated for C++ code when the SWIG
          'directors' feature is turned on. The default value is _wrap.h.

   SWIGFLAGS
          General options passed to the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generator. This is where you should set -python,
          -perl5, -tcl, or whatever other options you want to specify to
          SWIG. If you set the -c++ option in this variable, scons will,
          by default, generate a C++ intermediate source file with the
          extension that is specified as the [1718]$CXXFILESUFFIX
          variable.

   _SWIGINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          SWIG command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for included files. The value of $_SWIGINCFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending $SWIGINCPREFIX
          and $SWIGINCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $SWIGPATH.

   SWIGINCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be prepended to the beginning of each
          directory in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the
          $_SWIGINCFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGINCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each directory
          in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the $_SWIGINCFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGOUTDIR
          Specifies the output directory in which the scripting language
          wrapper and interface generator should place generated
          language-specific files. This will be used by SCons to identify
          the files that will be generated by the swig call, and
          translated into the swig -outdir option on the command line.

   SWIGPATH
          The list of directories that the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generate will search for included files. The SWIG
          implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for
          include files. The default value is an empty list.

          Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in SWIGFLAGS;
          the result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          SWIGPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory
          when they are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a
          directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(SWIGPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(SWIGPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_SWIGINCFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending
          the values of the $SWIGINCPREFIX and $SWIGINCSUFFIX construction
          variables to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $SWIGPATH. Any command lines you define that need the SWIGPATH
          directory list should include $_SWIGINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(SWIGCOM="my_swig -o $TARGET $_SWIGINCFLAGS $SOURCES")

   SWIGVERSION
          The version number of the SWIG tool.

   TAR
          The tar archiver.

   TARCOM
          The command line used to call the tar archiver.

   TARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when archiving files using the tar
          archiver. If this is not set, then [1719]$TARCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   TARFLAGS
          General options passed to the tar archiver.

   TARGET
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   TARGET_ARCH
          The name of the target hardware architecture for the compiled
          objects created by this Environment. This defaults to the value
          of HOST_ARCH, and the user can override it. Currently only set
          for Win32.

          Sets the target architecture for the Visual C++ compiler (i.e.
          the arch of the binaries generated by the compiler). If not set,
          default to [1720]$HOST_ARCH, or, if that is unset, to the
          architecture of the running machine's OS (note that the python
          build or architecture has no effect). This variable must be
          passed as an argument to the Environment() constructor; setting
          it later has no effect. This is currently only used on Windows,
          but in the future it will be used on other OSes as well. If this
          is set and [1721]$MSVC_VERSION is not set, this will search for
          all installed MSVC's that support the $TARGET_ARCH, selecting
          the latest version for use.

          On Windows, valid target values are x86, arm, i386 for 32-bit
          targets and amd64, arm64, em64t, x86_64 and ia64 (Itanium) for
          64-bit targets. Note that not all target architectures are
          supported for all Visual Studio / MSVC versions. Check the
          relevant Microsoft documentation.

          For example, if you want to compile 64-bit binaries, you would
          set TARGET_ARCH='x86_64' in your SCons environment.

   TARGET_OS
          The name of the target operating system for the compiled objects
          created by this Environment. This defaults to the value of
          HOST_OS, and the user can override it. Currently only set for
          Win32.

   TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   TARSUFFIX
          The suffix used for tar file names.

   TEMPFILEARGJOIN
          The string (or character) to be used to join the arguments
          passed to TEMPFILE when command line exceeds the limit set by
          $MAXLINELENGTH. The default value is a space. However for MSVC,
          MSLINK the default is a line seperator characters as defined by
          os.linesep. Note this value is used literally and not expanded
          by the subst logic.

   TEMPFILEDIR
          The directory to create the tempfile in.

   TEMPFILEPREFIX
          The prefix for a temporary file used to store lines lines longer
          than $MAXLINELENGTH as operations which call out to a shell will
          fail if the line is too long, which particularly impacts
          linking. The default is '@', which works for the Microsoft and
          GNU toolchains on Windows. Set this appropriately for other
          toolchains, for example '-@' for the diab compiler or '-via' for
          ARM toolchain.

   TEMPFILESUFFIX
          The suffix used for the temporary file name used for long
          command lines. The name should include the dot ('.') if one is
          wanted as it will not be added automatically. The default is
          '.lnk'.

   TEX
          The TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXCOM
          The command line used to call the TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the TeX formatter and
          typesetter. If this is not set, then [1722]$TEXCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

   TEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXINPUTS
          List of directories that the LaTeX program will search for
          include directories. The LaTeX implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for \include and \import files.

   TEXTFILEPREFIX
          The prefix used for [1723]Textfile file names, an empty string
          by default.

   TEXTFILESUFFIX
          The suffix used for [1724]Textfile file names; .txt by default.

   TOOLS
          A list of the names of the Tool specifications that are part of
          this construction environment.

   UNCHANGED_SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   UNCHANGED_TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

          This is used to fill in the Vendor: field in the controlling
          information for RPM packages, and the Manufacturer: field in the
          controlling information for MSI packages.

   VERSION
          The version of the project, specified as a string.

   VSWHERE
          Specify the location of vswhere.exe.

          The vswhere.exe executable is distributed with Microsoft Visual
          Studio and Build Tools since the 2017 edition, but is also
          available standalone. It provides full information about
          installations of 2017 and later editions. With the -legacy
          argument, vswhere.exe can detect installations of the 2010
          through 2015 editions with limited data returned. If VSWHERE is
          set, SCons will use that location.

          Otherwise SCons will look in the following locations and set
          VSWHERE to the path of the first vswhere.exe located.

          + %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer
          + %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer
          + %ChocolateyInstall%\bin

          Note that VSWHERE must be set at the same time or prior to any
          of [1725]msvc, [1726]msvs , and/or [1727]mslink [1728]Tool being
          initialized. Either set it as follows

env = Environment(VSWHERE='c:/my/path/to/vswhere')

          or if your construction environment is created specifying an
          empty tools list (or a list of tools which omits all of default,
          msvs, msvc, and mslink), and also before [1729]env.Tool is
          called to ininitialize any of those tools:

    env = Environment(tools=[])
    env['VSWHERE'] = r'c:/my/vswhere/install/location/vswhere.exe'
    env.Tool('msvc')
    env.Tool('mslink')
    env.Tool('msvs')

          [1737]$MTSHLIBCOM.

   WINDOWS_INSERT_DEF
          When this is set to true, a library build of a Windows shared
          library (.dll file) will also build a corresponding .def file at
          the same time, if a .def file is not already listed as a build
          target. The default is 0 (do not build a .def file).

          return appended. This is useful if some specific RPM feature not
          otherwise anticipated by SCons needs to be turned on or off.
          Note if this variable is omitted, SCons will by default supply
          the value '%global debug_package %{nil}' to disable debug
          package generation. To enable debug package generation, include
          this variable set either to None, or to a custom list that does

          This is used to fill in the Provides: field in the RPM .spec
          file.

   X_RPM_REQUIRES
          This is used to fill in the Requires: field in the RPM .spec
          file.

   X_RPM_SERIAL
          This is used to fill in the Serial: field in the RPM .spec file.

   X_RPM_URL
          This is used to fill in the Url: field in the RPM .spec file.

   XGETTEXT
          Path to xgettext(1) program (found via Detect()). See
          [1738]xgettext tool and [1739]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTCOM
          Complete xgettext command line. See [1740]xgettext tool and
          [1741]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTCOMSTR
          A string that is shown when xgettext(1) command is invoked
          (default: '', which means "print [1742]$XGETTEXTCOM"). See
          [1743]xgettext tool and [1744]POTUpdate builder.

   _XGETTEXTDOMAIN
          Internal "macro". Generates xgettext domain name form source and
          target (default: '${TARGET.filebase}').

   XGETTEXTFLAGS
          Additional flags to xgettext(1). See [1745]xgettext tool and
          [1746]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTFROM
          Name of file containing list of xgettext(1)'s source files.
          Autotools' users know this as POTFILES.in so they will in most
          cases set XGETTEXTFROM="POTFILES.in" here. The $XGETTEXTFROM
          files have same syntax and semantics as the well known GNU
          POTFILES.in. See [1747]xgettext tool and [1748]POTUpdate
          builder.

   _XGETTEXTFROMFLAGS

          [1749]$XGETTEXTPATH list.

   XGETTEXTFROMPREFIX
          This flag is used to add single [1750]$XGETTEXTFROM file to
          xgettext(1)'s commandline (default: '-f').

   XGETTEXTFROMSUFFIX
          (default: '')

   XGETTEXTPATH
          List of directories, there xgettext(1) will look for source
          files (default: []).

Note

          This variable works only together with [1751]$XGETTEXTFROM

          See also [1752]xgettext tool and [1753]POTUpdate builder.

   _XGETTEXTPATHFLAGS
          Internal "macro". Generates list of -f<file> flags from
          [1754]$XGETTEXTFROM.

   XGETTEXTPATHPREFIX
          This flag is used to add single search path to xgettext(1)'s
          commandline (default: '-D').

   XGETTEXTPATHSUFFIX
          (default: '')

   YACC
          The parser generator.

   YACCCOM
          The command line used to call the parser generator to generate a
          source file.

   YACCCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          parser generator. If this is not set, then [1755]$YACCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(YACCCOMSTR = "Yacc'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   YACCFLAGS
          General options passed to the parser generator. If
          [1756]$YACCFLAGS contains a -d option, SCons assumes that the
          call will also create a .h file (if the yacc source file ends in
          a .y suffix) or a .hpp file (if the yacc source file ends in a
          .yy suffix)

   YACCHFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option is used. Note that setting this
          variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          header file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .h.

   YACCHXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C++ header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option is used. Note that setting this
          variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          header file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .hpp, except on Mac OS X, where the
          default is ${TARGET.suffix}.h. because the default bison parser
          generator just appends .h to the name of the generated C++ file.

   YACCVCGFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the file containing the VCG grammar automaton
          definition when the --graph= option is used. Note that setting
          this variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          VCG file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .vcg.

   ZIP
          The zip compression and file packaging utility.

   ZIP_OVERRIDE_TIMESTAMP
          An optional timestamp which overrides the last modification time
          of the file when stored inside the Zip archive. This is a tuple
          of six values: Year (>= 1980) Month (one-based) Day of month
          (one-based) Hours (zero-based) Minutes (zero-based) Seconds
          (zero-based)

   ZIPCOM
          The command line used to call the zip utility, or the internal
          Python function used to create a zip archive.

   ZIPCOMPRESSION
          The compression flag from the Python zipfile module used by the
          internal Python function to control whether the zip archive is
          compressed or not. The default value is zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED,
          which creates a compressed zip archive. This value has no effect
          if the zipfile module is unavailable.

   ZIPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when archiving files using the zip utility.
          If this is not set, then [1757]$ZIPCOM (the command line or
          internal Python function) is displayed.

env = Environment(ZIPCOMSTR = "Zipping $TARGET")

   ZIPFLAGS
          General options passed to the zip utility.

   ZIPROOT
          An optional zip root directory (default empty). The filenames
          stored in the zip file will be relative to this directory, if
          given. Otherwise the filenames are relative to the current
          directory of the command. For instance:

env = Environment()
env.Zip('foo.zip', 'subdir1/subdir2/file1', ZIPROOT='subdir1')

          will produce a zip file foo.zip containing a file with the name
          subdir2/file1 rather than subdir1/subdir2/file1.

   ZIPSUFFIX
          The suffix used for zip file names.

Configure Contexts

   SCons supports a configure context, an integrated mechanism similar to
   the various AC_CHECK macros in GNU Autoconf for testing the existence
   of external items needed for the build, such as C header files,
   libraries, etc. The mechanism is portable across platforms.

   scons does not maintain an explicit cache of the tested values (this is
   different than Autoconf), but uses its normal dependency tracking to
   keep the checked values up to date. However, users may override this
   behaviour with the --config command line option.

   Configure(env, [custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h, clean,
          help])
          env.Configure([custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h,
          clean, help])
          Create a configure context, which tracks information discovered
          while running tests. The context includes a local construction
          environment (available as context.env) which is used when
          running the tests and which can be updated with the check
          results. Only one context may be active at a time (since 4.0,
          scons will raise an exception on an attempt to create a new
          context when there is an active context), but a new context can
          be created after the active one is completed. For the global
          function form, the required env describes the initial values for
          the context's local construction environment; for the
          construction environment method form the instance provides the
          values.

          custom_tests specifies a dictionary containing custom tests (see
          the section on custom tests below). The default value is None,
          meaning no custom tests are added to the configure context.

          conf_dir specifies a directory where the test cases are built.
          This directory is not used for building normal targets. The
          default value is "#/.sconf_temp".

          log_file specifies a file which collects the output from
          commands that are executed to check for the existence of header
          files, libraries, etc. The default is "#/config.log". If you are
          using the VariantDir function, you may want to specify a
          subdirectory under your variant directory.

          config_h specifies a C header file where the results of tests
          will be written. The results will consist of lines like #define
          HAVE_STDIO_H, #define HAVE_LIBM, etc. Customarily, the name
          chosen is "config.h". The default is to not write a config_h
          file. You can specify the same config_h file in multiple calls
          to Configure, in which case SCons will concatenate all results
          in the specified file. Note that SCons uses its normal
          dependency checking to decide if it's necessary to rebuild the
          specified config_h file. This means that the file is not
          necessarily re-built each time scons is run, but is only rebuilt
          if its contents will have changed and some target that depends
          on the config_h file is being built.

          The clean and help arguments can be used to suppress execution
          of the configuration tests when the -c/--clean or -H/-h/--help
          options are used, respectively. The default behavior is always
          to execute configure context tests, since the results of the
          tests may affect the list of targets to be cleaned or the help
          text. If the configure tests do not affect these, then you may
          add the clean=False or help=False arguments (or both) to avoid
          unnecessary test execution.

   SConf.Finish(context)
          context.Finish()
          This method must be called after configuration is done. Though
          required, this is not enforced except if Configure is called
          again while there is still an active context, in which case an
          exception is raised. Finish returns the environment as modified
          during the course of running the configuration checks. After
          this method is called, no further checks can be performed with
          this configuration context. However, you can create a new
          configure context to perform additional checks.

   Example of a typical Configure usage:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckCHeader("math.h"):
    print("We really need math.h!")
    Exit(1)
if conf.CheckLibWithHeader("qt", "qapp.h", "c++", "QApplication qapp(0,0);"):
    # do stuff for qt - usage, e.g.
    conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES="WITH_QT")
env = conf.Finish()

   A configure context has the following predefined methods which can be
   used to perform checks. Where language is a required or optional
   parameter, the choice can currently be C or C++. The spellings accepted
   for C are "C" or "c"; for C++ the value can be "CXX", "cxx", "C++" or
   "c++".

   SConf.CheckHeader(context, header, [include_quotes, language])
          context.CheckHeader(header, [include_quotes, language])
          Checks if header is usable in the specified language. header may
          be a list, in which case the last item in the list is the header
          file to be checked, and the previous list items are header files
          whose #include lines should precede the header line being
          checked for. The optional argument include_quotes must be a two
          character string, where the first character denotes the opening
          quote and the second character denotes the closing quote. By
          default, both characters are " (double quote). The optional
          argument language should be either C or C++ and selects the
          compiler to be used for the check. Returns a boolean indicating
          success or failure.

   SConf.CheckCHeader(context, header, [include_quotes])
          context.CheckCHeader(header, [include_quotes])
          This is a wrapper around SConf.CheckHeader which checks if
          header is usable in the C language. header may be a list, in
          which case the last item in the list is the header file to be
          checked, and the previous list items are header files whose
          #include lines should precede the header line being checked for.
          The optional argument include_quotes must be a two character
          string, where the first character denotes the opening quote and
          the second character denotes the closing quote. By default, both
          characters are " (double quote). Returns a boolean indicating
          success or failure.

   SConf.CheckCXXHeader(context, header, [include_quotes])
          context.CheckCXXHeader(header, [include_quotes])
          This is a wrapper around SConf.CheckHeader which checks if
          header is usable in the C++ language. header may be a list, in
          which case the last item in the list is the header file to be
          checked, and the previous list items are header files whose
          #include lines should precede the header line being checked for.
          The optional argument include_quotes must be a two character
          string, where the first character denotes the opening quote and
          the second character denotes the closing quote. By default, both
          characters are " (double quote). Returns a boolean indicating
          success or failure.

   SConf.CheckFunc(context, function_name, [header, language])
          context.CheckFunc(function_name, [header, language])
          Checks if the specified C or C++ library function is available
          based on the context's local environment settings (that is,
          using the values of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LIBS or other relevant
          construction variables).

          function_name is the name of the function to check for. The
          optional header argument is a string that will be placed at the
          top of the test file that will be compiled to check if the
          function exists; the default is:

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
#endif
char function_name();

          Returns an empty string on success, a string containing an error
          message on failure.

   SConf.CheckLib(context, [library, symbol, header, language,
          autoadd=True])
          context.CheckLib([library, symbol, header, language,
          autoadd=True])
          Checks if library provides symbol. If autoadd is true (the
          default) and the library provides the specified symbol, appends
          the library to the LIBS construction variable library may also
          be None (the default), in which case symbol is checked with the
          current LIBS variable, or a list of library names, in which case
          each library in the list will be checked for symbol. If symbol
          is not set or is None, then SConf.CheckLib just checks if you
          can link against the specified library. Note though it is legal
          syntax, it would not be very useful to call this method with
          library and symbol both omitted or None. Returns a boolean
          indicating success or failure.

   SConf.CheckLibWithHeader(context, library, header, language, [call,
          autoadd=True])
          context.CheckLibWithHeader(library, header, language, [call,
          autoadd=True])
          Provides a more sophisticated way to check against libraries
          then the SConf.CheckLib call. library specifies the library or a
          list of libraries to check. header specifies a header to check
          for. header may be a list, in which case the last item in the
          list is the header file to be checked, and the previous list
          items are header files whose #include lines should precede the
          header line being checked for. call can be any valid expression
          (with a trailing ';'). If call is not set, the default simply
          checks that you can link against the specified library. autoadd
          (default true) specifies whether to add the library to the
          environment if the check succeeds. Returns a boolean indicating
          success or failure.

   SConf.CheckType(context, type_name, [includes, language])
          context.CheckType(type_name, [includes, language])
          Checks for the existence of a type defined by typedef. type_name
          specifies the typedef name to check for. includes is a string
          containing one or more #include lines that will be inserted into
          the program that will be run to test for the existence of the
          type. Example:

sconf.CheckType('foo_type', '#include "my_types.h"', 'C++')

          Returns an empty string on success, a string containing an error
          message on failure.

   SConf.CheckCC(context)
          context.CheckCC()
          Checks whether the C compiler (as defined by the CC construction
          variable) works by trying to compile a small source file.
          Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

          By default, SCons only detects if there is a program with the
          correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler.

          This uses the exact same command as the one used by the object
          builder for C source files, so it can be used to detect if a
          particular compiler flag works or not.

   SConf.CheckCXX(context)
          context.CheckCXX()
          Checks whether the C++ compiler (as defined by the CXX
          construction variable) works by trying to compile a small source
          file. By default, SCons only detects if there is a program with
          the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler. Returns a
          boolean indicating success or failure.

          This uses the exact same command as the one used by the object
          builder for C++ source files, so it can be used to detect if a
          particular compiler flag works or not.

   SConf.CheckSHCC(context)
          context.CheckSHCC()
          Checks whether the shared-object C compiler (as defined by the
          SHCC construction variable) works by trying to compile a small
          source file. By default, SCons only detects if there is a
          program with the correct name, not if it is a functioning
          compiler. Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

          This uses the exact same command as the one used by the object
          builder for C source file, so it can be used to detect if a
          particular compiler flag works or not. This does not check
          whether the object code can be used to build a shared library,
          only that the compilation (not link) succeeds.

   SConf.CheckSHCXX(context)
          context.CheckSHCXX()
          Checks whether the shared-object C++ compiler (as defined by the
          SHCXX construction variable) works by trying to compile a small
          source file. By default, SCons only detects if there is a
          program with the correct name, not if it is a functioning
          compiler. Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

          This uses the exact same command as the one used by the object
          builder for C++ source files, so it can be used to detect if a
          particular compiler flag works or not. This does not check
          whether the object code can be used to build a shared library,
          only that the compilation (not link) succeeds.

   SConf.CheckTypeSize(context, type_name, [header, language, expect])
          context.CheckTypeSize(type_name, [header, language, expect])
          Checks for the size of a type defined by typedef. type_name
          specifies the typedef name to check for. The optional header
          argument is a string that will be placed at the top of the test
          file that will be compiled to check if the type exists; the
          default is empty. If the optional expect, is supplied, it should
          be an integer size; CheckTypeSize will fail unless type_name is
          actually that size. Returns the size in bytes, or zero if the
          type was not found (or if the size did not match expect).

          For example,

CheckTypeSize('short', expect=2)

          will return the size 2 only if short is actually two bytes.

   SConf.CheckDeclaration(context, symbol, [includes, language])
          context.CheckDeclaration(symbol, [includes, language])
          Checks if the specified symbol is declared. includes is a string
          containing one or more #include lines that will be inserted into
          the program that will be run to test for the existence of the
          symbol. Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

   SConf.Define(context, symbol, [value, comment])
          context.Define(symbol, [value, comment])
          This function does not check for anything, but defines a
          preprocessor symbol that will be added to the configuration
          header file. It is the equivalent of AC_DEFINE, and defines the
          symbol name with the optional value and the optional comment
          comment.

          Define Examples:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL
conf.Define("A_SYMBOL")

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL 1
conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", 1)

          Be careful about quoting string values, though:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL YA
conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", "YA")

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL "YA"
conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", '"YA"')

          For comment:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)

# Puts the following lines in the config header file:
#    /* Set to 1 if you have a symbol */
#    #define A_SYMBOL 1
conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", 1, "Set to 1 if you have a symbol")

   You can define your own custom checks in addition to the predefined
   checks. You pass a dictionary of these to the Configure function as the
   custom_tests argument. This dictionary maps the names of the checks to
   the user defined Python callables (either Python functions or class
   instances implementing a __call__ method). Each custom check will be
   called with a first argument of a CheckContext, instance followed by
   the arguments, which must be supplied by the user of the check. A
   CheckContext instance defines the following methods:

   context.Message(text)
          Displays a message, as an indicator of progess. text will be
          displayed, e.g. Checking for library X.... Usually called before
          the check is started.

   context.Result(res)
          Displays a "result" message, as an indicator of progress. res
          can be either an integer or a string. If an integer, displays
          yes (if res evaluates True) or no (if res evaluates False). If a
          string, it is displayed as-is. Usually called after the check
          has completed.

   context.TryCompile(text, extension='')
          Checks if a file with the specified extension (e.g. '.c')
          containing text can be compiled using the environment's Object
          builder. Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

   context.TryLink(text, extension='')
          Checks, if a file with the specified extension (e.g. '.c')
          containing text can be compiled using the environment's Program
          builder. Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

   context.TryRun(text, extension='')
          Checks if a file with the specified extension (e.g. '.c')
          containing text can be compiled using the environment's Program
          builder. On success, the program is run. If the program executes
          successfully (that is, its return status is 0), a tuple (1,
          outputStr) is returned, where outputStr is the standard output
          of the program. If the program fails execution (its return
          status is non-zero), then (0, '') is returned.

   context.TryAction(action, [text, extension=''])
          Checks if the specified action with an optional source file
          (contents text, extension extension) can be executed. action may
          be anything which can be converted to a scons Action. On
          success, (1, outputStr) is returned, where outputStr is the
          content of the target file. On failure (0, '') is returned.

   context.TryBuild(builder[, text, extension=''])
          Low level implementation for testing specific builds; the
          methods above are based on this method. Given the Builder
          instance builder and the optional text of a source file with
          optional extension, returns a boolean indicating success or
          failure. In addition, context.lastTarget is set to the build
          target node if the build was successful.

   Example of implementing and using custom tests:
def CheckQt(context, qtdir):
    context.Message( 'Checking for qt ...' )
    lastLIBS = context.env['LIBS']
    lastLIBPATH = context.env['LIBPATH']
    lastCPPPATH= context.env['CPPPATH']
    context.env.Append(LIBS='qt', LIBPATH=qtdir + '/lib', CPPPATH=qtdir + '/incl
ude')
    ret = context.TryLink("""
#include <qapp.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  QApplication qapp(argc, argv);
  return 0;
}
""")
    if not ret:
        context.env.Replace(LIBS=lastLIBS, LIBPATH=lastLIBPATH, CPPPATH=lastCPPP
ATH)
    context.Result( ret )
    return ret

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env, custom_tests={'CheckQt': CheckQt})
if not conf.CheckQt('/usr/lib/qt'):
    print('We really need qt!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

Command-Line Construction Variables

   Often when building software, some variables need to be specified at
   build time. For example, libraries needed for the build may be in
   non-standard locations, or site-specific compiler options may need to
   be passed to the compiler. SCons provides a Variables object to support
   overriding construction variables with values obtained from various
   sources, often from the command line:
scons VARIABLE=foo

   The variable values can also be specified in a configuration file or an
   SConscript file.

   To obtain the object for manipulating values, call the Variables
   function:

   Variables([files, [args]])
          If files is a file or list of files, those are executed as
          Python scripts, and the values of (global) Python variables set
          in those files are added as construction variables in the
          Default Environment. If no files are specified, or the files
          argument is None, then no files will be read (supplying None is
          necessary if there are no files but you want to specify args as
          a positional argument).

          The following example file contents could be used to set an
          alternative C compiler:

CC = 'my_cc'

          If args is specified, it is a dictionary of values that will
          override anything read from files. This is primarily intended to
          pass the ARGUMENTS dictionary that holds variables specified on
          the command line. Example:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars = Variables('overrides.py', ARGUMENTS)
vars = Variables(None, {FOO:'expansion', BAR:7})

          Calling Variables with no arguments is equivalent to:

vars = Variables(files=None, args=ARGUMENTS)

          Note that since the variables are eventually added as
          construction variables, you should choose variable names which
          do not unintentionally change pre-defined construction variables
          that your project will make use of (see [1758]the section called
          "Construction Variables").

   Variables objects have the following methods:

   vars.Add(key, [help, default, validator, converter])
          Add a customizable construction variable to the Variables
          object. key is the name of the variable. help is the help text
          for the variable. default is the default value of the variable;
          if the default value is None and there is no explicit value
          specified, the construction variable will not be added to the
          construction environment. If set, validator is called to
          validate the value of the variable. A function supplied as a
          validator shall accept arguments: key, value, and env. The
          recommended way to handle an invalid value is to raise an
          exception (see example below). If set, converter is called to
          convert the value before putting it in the environment, and
          should take either a value, or the value and environment, as
          parameters. The converter function must return a value, which
          will be converted into a string before being validated by the
          validator (if any) and then added to the construction
          environment.

          Examples:

vars.Add('CC', help='The C compiler')

def valid_color(key, val, env):
    if not val in ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']:
        raise Exception("Invalid color value '%s'" % val)

vars.Add('COLOR', validator=valid_color)

   vars.AddVariables(args)
          A convenience method that adds multiple customizable
          construction variables to a Variables object in one call;
          equivalent to calling Add multiple times. The args are tuples
          (or lists) that contain the arguments for an individual call to
          the Add method. Since tuples are not Python mappings, the
          arguments cannot use the keyword form, but rather are positional
          arguments as documented for Add: a required name, the rest
          optional but must be in the specified in order if used.

opt.AddVariables(
    ("debug", "", 0),
    ("CC", "The C compiler"),
    ("VALIDATE", "An option for testing validation", "notset", validator, None),
)

   vars.Update(env, [args])
          Update a construction environment env with the customized
          construction variables . Any specified variables that are not
          configured for the Variables object will be saved and may be
          retrieved using the UnknownVariables method, below.

          Normally this method is not called directly, but rather invoked
          indirectly by passing the Variables object to the
          [1759]Environment function:

env = Environment(variables=vars)

   vars.UnknownVariables()
          Returns a dictionary containing any variables that were
          specified either in the files or the dictionary with which the
          Variables object was initialized, but for which the Variables
          object was not configured.

env = Environment(variables=vars)
for key, value in vars.UnknownVariables():
    print("unknown variable:  %s=%s" % (key, value))

   vars.Save(filename, env)
          Save the currently set variables into a script file named by
          filename that can be used on the next invocation to
          automatically load the current settings. This method combined
          with the Variables method can be used to support caching of
          variables between runs.

env = Environment()
vars = Variables(['variables.cache', 'custom.py'])
vars.Add(...)
vars.Update(env)
vars.Save('variables.cache', env)

   vars.GenerateHelpText(env, [sort])
          Generate help text documenting the customizable construction
          variables, suitable for passing in to the [1760]Help function.
          env is the construction environment that will be used to get the
          actual values of the customizable variables. If the (optional)
          value of sort is callable, it is used as a comparison function
          to determine how to sort the added variables. This function must
          accept two arguments, compare them, and return a negative
          integer if the first is less-than the second, zero for equality,
          or a positive integer for greater-than. Optionally a Boolean
          value of True for sort will cause a standard alphabetical sort
          to be performed.

Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

def cmp(a, b):
    return (a > b) - (a < b)

Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env, sort=cmp))

   vars.FormatVariableHelpText(env, opt, help, default, actual)
          Returns a formatted string containing the printable help text
          for one option. It is normally not called directly, but is
          called by the GenerateHelpText method to create the returned
          help text. It may be overridden with your own function that
          takes the arguments specified above and returns a string of help
          text formatted to your liking. Note that GenerateHelpText will
          not put any blank lines or extra characters in between the
          entries, so you must add those characters to the returned string
          if you want the entries separated.

def my_format(env, opt, help, default, actual):
    fmt = "\n%s: default=%s actual=%s (%s)\n"
    return fmt % (opt, default, actual, help)
vars.FormatVariableHelpText = my_format

   To make it more convenient to work with customizable Variables, scons
   provides a number of functions that make it easy to set up various
   types of Variables. Each of these return a tuple ready to be passed to
   the Add or AddVariables method:

   BoolVariable(key, help, default)
          Returns a tuple of arguments to set up a Boolean option. The
          option will use the specified name key, have a default value of
          default, and help will form the descriptive part of the help
          text. The option will interpret the values y, yes, t, true, 1,
          on and all as true, and the values n, no, f, false, 0, off and
          none as false.

   EnumVariable(key, help, default, allowed_values, [map, ignorecase])
          Returns a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value may
          be one of a specified list of legal enumerated values. The
          option will use the specified name key, have a default value of
          default, and help will form the descriptive part of the help
          text. The option will only support those values in the
          allowed_values list. The optional map argument is a dictionary
          that can be used to convert input values into specific legal
          values in the allowed_values list. If the value of ignore_case
          is 0 (the default), then the values are case-sensitive. If the
          value of ignore_case is 1, then values will be matched
          case-insensitively. If the value of ignore_case is 2, then
          values will be matched case-insensitively, and all input values
          will be converted to lower case.

   ListVariable(key, help, default, names, [map])
          Returns a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value may
          be one or more of a specified list of legal enumerated values.
          The option will use the specified name key, have a default value
          of default, and help will form the descriptive part of the help
          text. The option will only accept the values "all", "none", or
          the values in the names list. More than one value may be
          specified, separated by commas. The default may be a string of
          comma-separated default values, or a list of the default values.
          The optional map argument is a dictionary that can be used to
          convert input values into specific legal values in the names
          list. (Note that the additional values accepted through the use
          of a map are not reflected in the generated help message).

   PackageVariable(key, help, default)
          Returns a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value is
          a path name of a package that may be enabled, disabled or given
          an explicit path name. The option will use the specified name
          key, have a default value of default, and help will form the
          descriptive part of the help text. The option will support the
          values yes, true, on, enable or search, in which case the
          specified default will be used, or the option may be set to an
          arbitrary string (typically the path name to a package that is
          being enabled). The option will also support the values no,
          false, off or disable to disable use of the specified option.

   PathVariable(key, help, default, [validator])
          Returns a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value is
          expected to be a path name. The option will use the specified
          name key, have a default value of default, and help will form
          the descriptive part of the help text. An additional validator
          may be specified that will be called to verify that the
          specified path is acceptable. SCons supplies the following
          ready-made validators:

        PathVariable.PathExists
                Verify that the specified path exists (this the default
                behavior if no validator is supplied).

        PathVariable.PathIsFile
                Verify that the specified path exists and is a regular
                file.

        PathVariable.PathIsDir
                Verify that the specified path exists and is a directory.

        PathVariable.PathIsDirCreate
                Verify that the specified path exists and is a directory;
                if it does not exist, create the directory.

        PathVariable.PathAccept
                Accept the specific path name argument without validation,
                suitable for when you want your users to be able to
                specify a directory path that will be created as part of
                the build process, for example.

          You may supply your own validator function, which must accept
          three arguments (key, the name of the variable to be set; val,
          the specified value being checked; and env, the construction
          environment) and should raise an exception if the specified
          value is not acceptable.

   These functions make it convenient to create a number of variables with
   consistent behavior in a single call to the AddVariables method:
vars.AddVariables(
    BoolVariable(
        "warnings",
        help="compilation with -Wall and similar",
        default=1,
    ),
    EnumVariable(
        "debug",
        help="debug output and symbols",
        default="no",
        allowed_values=("yes", "no", "full"),
        map={},
        ignorecase=0,  # case sensitive
    ),
    ListVariable(
        "shared",
        help="libraries to build as shared libraries",
        default="all",
        names=list_of_libs,
    ),
    PackageVariable(
        "x11",
        help="use X11 installed here (yes = search some places)",
        default="yes",
    ),
    PathVariable(
        "qtdir",
        help="where the root of Qt is installed",
        default=qtdir),
    PathVariable(
        "foopath",
        help="where the foo library is installed",
        default=foopath,
        validator=PathVariable.PathIsDir,
    ),
)

File and Directory Nodes

   The [1761]File and [1762]Dir functions/methods return File and
   Directory Nodes, respectively. Such nodes are Python objects with
   several user-visible attributes and methods that are often useful to
   access in SConscript files:

   n.path
          The build path of the given file or directory. This path is
          relative to the top-level directory (where the SConstruct file
          is found). The build path is the same as the source path if
          variant_dir is not being used.

   n.abspath
          The absolute build path of the given file or directory.

   n.srcnode()
          The srcnode method returns another File or Directory Node
          representing the source path of the given File or Directory
          Node.

   For example:
# Get the current build dir's path, relative to top.
Dir('.').path
# Current dir's absolute path
Dir('.').abspath
# Next line is always '.', because it is the top dir's path relative to itself.
Dir('#.').path
File('foo.c').srcnode().path   # source path of the given source file.

# Builders also return File objects:
foo = env.Program('foo.c')
print("foo will be built in", foo.path)

   File and Directory Node objects have methods to create File and
   Directory Nodes relative to the original Node.

   If the object is a Directory Node, these methods will place the the new
   Node within the directory the Node represents:

   d.Dir(name)
          Returns a directory Node for a subdirectory of d named name.

   d.File(name)
          Returns a file Node for a file within d named name.

   d.Entry(name)
          Returns an unresolved Node within d named name.

   If the object is a File Node, these methods will place the the new Node
   in the same directory as the one the Node represents:

   f.Dir(name)
          Returns a directory named name within the parent directory of f.

   f.File(name)
          Returns a file named name within the parent directory of f.

   f.Entry(name)
          Returns an unresolved Node named name within the parent
          directory of f.

   For example:
# Get a Node for a file within a directory
incl = Dir('include')
f = incl.File('header.h')

# Get a Node for a subdirectory within a directory
dist = Dir('project-3.2.1')
src = dist.Dir('src')

# Get a Node for a file in the same directory
cfile = File('sample.c')
hfile = cfile.File('sample.h')

# Combined example
docs = Dir('docs')
html = docs.Dir('html')
index = html.File('index.html')
css = index.File('app.css')

EXTENDING SCONS

Builder Objects

   scons can be extended to build different types of targets by adding new
   Builder objects to a construction environment. In general, you should
   only need to add a new Builder object when you want to build a new type
   of file or other external target. If you just want to invoke a
   different compiler or other tool to build Program, Object, Library, or
   any other type of output file for which scons already has an existing
   Builder, it is generally much easier to use those existing Builders in
   a construction environment that sets the appropriate construction
   variables (CC, LINK, etc.).

   Builder objects are created using the [1763]Builder factory function.
   The Builder function accepts the following keyword arguments:

   action
          The command line string used to build the target from the
          source. action can also be: a list of strings representing the
          command to be executed and its arguments (suitable for enclosing
          white space in an argument), a dictionary mapping source file
          name suffixes to any combination of command line strings (if the
          builder should accept multiple source file extensions), a Python
          function; an Action object (see the next section); or a list of
          any of the above.

          An action function takes three arguments:

          source - a list of source nodes;.
          target - a list of target nodes;.
          env - the construction environment.

          The action and generator arguments must not both be used for the
          same Builder.

   prefix
          The prefix that will be prepended to the target file name.
          prefix may be:

          + a string
          + a callable object - a function or other callable that takes
            two arguments (a construction environment and a list of
            sources) and returns a prefix
          + a dictionary - specifies a mapping from a specific source
            suffix (of the first source specified) to a corresponding
            target prefix. Both the source suffix and target prefix
            specifications may use environment variable substitution, and
            the target prefix (the 'value' entries in the dictionary) may
            also be a callable object. The default target prefix may be
            indicated by a dictionary entry with a key value of None.

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
            prefix = "file-")

def gen_prefix(env, sources):
    return "file-" + env['PLATFORM'] + '-'
b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
            prefix = gen_prefix)

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
            suffix = { None: "file-",
                       "$SRC_SFX_A": gen_prefix })

   suffix
          The suffix that will be appended to the target file name. This
          may be specified in the same manner as the prefix above. If the
          suffix is a string, then scons will append a '.' to the
          beginning of the suffix if it's not already there. The string
          returned by callable object (or obtained from the dictionary) is
          untouched and must append its own '.' to the beginning if one is
          desired.

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET"
            suffix = "-file")

def gen_suffix(env, sources):
    return "." + env['PLATFORM'] + "-file"
b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
            suffix = gen_suffix)

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
            suffix = { None: ".sfx1",
                       "$SRC_SFX_A": gen_suffix })

   ensure_suffix
          When set to any true value, causes scons to add the target
          suffix specified by the suffix keyword to any target strings
          that have a different suffix. (The default behavior is to leave
          untouched any target file name that looks like it already has
          any suffix.)

b1 = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET"
             suffix = ".out")
b2 = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET"
             suffix = ".out",
             ensure_suffix)
env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS']['B1'] = b1
env['BUILDERS']['B2'] = b2

# Builds "foo.txt" because ensure_suffix is not set.
env.B1('foo.txt', 'foo.in')

# Builds "bar.txt.out" because ensure_suffix is set.
env.B2('bar.txt', 'bar.in')

   src_suffix
          The expected source file name suffix. This may be a string or a
          list of strings.

   target_scanner
          A Scanner object that will be invoked to find implicit
          dependencies for this target file. This keyword argument should
          be used for Scanner objects that find implicit dependencies
          based only on the target file and the construction environment,
          not for implicit dependencies based on source files. See
          [1764]the section called "Scanner Objects" for information about
          creating Scanner objects.

   source_scanner
          A Scanner object that will be invoked to find implicit
          dependencies in any source files used to build this target file.
          This is where you would specify a scanner to find things like
          #include lines in source files. The pre-built DirScanner Scanner
          object may be used to indicate that this Builder should scan
          directory trees for on-disk changes to files that scons does not
          know about from other Builder or function calls. See [1765]the
          section called "Scanner Objects" for information about creating
          your own Scanner objects.

   target_factory
          A factory function that the Builder will use to turn any targets
          specified as strings into SCons Nodes. By default, SCons assumes
          that all targets are files. Other useful target_factory values
          include Dir, for when a Builder creates a directory target, and
          Entry, for when a Builder can create either a file or directory
          target.

          Example:

MakeDirectoryBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, target_factory=Dir)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS={'MakeDirectory': MakeDirectoryBuilder})
env.MakeDirectory('new_directory', [])

          Note that the call to this MakeDirectory Builder needs to
          specify an empty source list to make the string represent the
          builder's target; without that, it would assume the argument is
          the source, and would try to deduce the target name from it,
          which in the absence of an automatically-added prefix or suffix
          would lead to a matching target and source name and a circular
          dependency.

   source_factory
          A factory function that the Builder will use to turn any sources
          specified as strings into SCons Nodes. By default, SCons assumes
          that all source are files. Other useful source_factory values
          include Dir, for when a Builder uses a directory as a source,
          and Entry, for when a Builder can use files or directories (or
          both) as sources.

          Example:

CollectBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, source_factory=Entry)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS={'Collect': CollectBuilder})
env.Collect('archive', ['directory_name', 'file_name'])

   emitter
          A function or list of functions to manipulate the target and
          source lists before dependencies are established and the
          target(s) are actually built. emitter can also be a string
          containing a construction variable to expand to an emitter
          function or list of functions, or a dictionary mapping source
          file suffixes to emitter functions. (Only the suffix of the
          first source file is used to select the actual emitter function
          from an emitter dictionary.)

          An emitter function takes three arguments:

          source - a list of source nodes.
          target - a list of target nodes.
          env - the construction environment.

          An emitter must return a tuple containing two lists, the list of
          targets to be built by this builder, and the list of sources for
          this builder.

          Example:

def e(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['foo.foo'], source + ['foo.src'])

# Simple association of an emitter function with a Builder.
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = e)

def e2(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['bar.foo'], source + ['bar.src'])

# Simple association of a list of emitter functions with a Builder.
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = [e, e2])

# Calling an emitter function through a construction variable.
env = Environment(MY_EMITTER=e)
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter='$MY_EMITTER')

# Calling a list of emitter functions through a construction variable.
env = Environment(EMITTER_LIST=[e, e2])
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter='$EMITTER_LIST')

# Associating multiple emitters with different file
# suffixes using a dictionary.
def e_suf1(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['another_target_file'], source)
def e_suf2(target, source, env):
    return (target, source + ['another_source_file'])
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter={'.suf1' : e_suf1,
                     '.suf2' : e_suf2})

   multi
          Specifies whether this builder is allowed to be called multiple
          times for the same target file(s). The default is 0, which means
          the builder can not be called multiple times for the same target
          file(s). Calling a builder multiple times for the same target
          simply adds additional source files to the target; it is not
          allowed to change the environment associated with the target,
          specify additional environment overrides, or associate a
          different builder with the target.

   env
          A construction environment that can be used to fetch source code
          using this Builder. (Note that this environment is not used for
          normal builds of normal target files, which use the environment
          that was used to call the Builder for the target file.)

   generator
          A function that returns a list of actions that will be executed
          to build the target(s) from the source(s). The returned
          action(s) may be an Action object, or anything that can be
          converted into an Action object (see the next section).

          The generator function takes four arguments:

          source - A list of source nodes;.
          target - A list of target nodes;.
          env - the construction environment.
   for_signature - A Boolean value that specifies whether the generator is
   being called for generating a build signature (as opposed to actually
   executing the command).

          Example:

def g(source, target, env, for_signature):
    return [["gcc", "-c", "-o"] + target + source]

b = Builder(generator=g)

          The generator and action arguments must not both be used for the
          same Builder.

   src_builder
          Specifies a builder to use when a source file name suffix does
          not match any of the suffixes of the builder. Using this
          argument produces a multi-stage builder.

   single_source
          Specifies that this builder expects exactly one source file per
          call. Giving more than one source file without target files
          results in implicitly calling the builder multiple times (once
          for each source given). Giving multiple source files together
          with target files results in a UserError exception.

   source_ext_match
          When the specified action argument is a dictionary, the default
          behavior when a builder is passed multiple source files is to
          make sure that the extensions of all the source files match. If
          it is legal for this builder to be called with a list of source
          files with different extensions, this check can be suppressed by
          setting source_ext_match to None or some other non-true value.
          When source_ext_match is disable, scons will use the suffix of
          the first specified source file to select the appropriate action
          from the action dictionary.

          In the following example, the setting of source_ext_match
          prevents scons from exiting with an error due to the mismatched
          suffixes of foo.in and foo.extra.

b = Builder(action={'.in' : 'build $SOURCES > $TARGET'},
            source_ext_match = None)

env = Environment(BUILDERS={'MyBuild':b})
env.MyBuild('foo.out', ['foo.in', 'foo.extra'])

   env
          A construction environment that can be used to fetch source code
          using this Builder. (Note that this environment is not used for
          normal builds of normal target files, which use the environment
          that was used to call the Builder for the target file.)

b = Builder(action="build < $SOURCE > $TARGET")
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('foo.out', 'foo.in', my_arg='xyzzy')

   chdir
          A directory from which scons will execute the action(s)
          specified for this Builder. If the chdir argument is a string or
          a directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory.
          If the chdir is not a string or Node and is non-zero, then scons
          will change to the target file's directory.

          Note that scons will not automatically modify its expansion of
          construction variables like $TARGET and $SOURCE when using the
          chdir keyword argument--that is, the expanded file names will
          still be relative to the top-level directory containing the
          SConstruct file, and consequently incorrect relative to the
          chdir directory. Builders created using chdir keyword argument,
          will need to use construction variable expansions like
          ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to use just the filename
          portion of the targets and source.

b = Builder(action="build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}",
            chdir=1)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in')

Warning

          Python only keeps one current directory location even if there
          are multiple threads. This means that use of the chdir argument
          will not work with the SCons -j option, because individual
          worker threads spawned by SCons interfere with each other when
          they start changing directory.

   Any additional keyword arguments supplied when a Builder object is
   created (that is, when the [1766]Builder function is called) will be
   set in the executing construction environment when the Builder object
   is called. The canonical example here would be to set a construction
   variable to the repository of a source code system.

   Any additional keyword arguments supplied when a Builder object is
   called will only be associated with the target created by that
   particular Builder call (and any other files built as a result of the
   call).

   These extra keyword arguments are passed to the following functions:
   command generator functions, function Actions, and emitter functions.

Action Objects

   The [1767]Builder function will turn its action keyword argument into
   an appropriate internal Action object, as will the [1768]Command
   function. You can also explicitly create Action objects for passing to
   Builder, or other functions that take actions as arguments, by calling
   the [1769]Action factory function. This may more efficient when
   multiple Builder objects need to do the same thing rather than letting
   each of those Builder objects create a separate Action object. It also
   allows more flexible configuration of an Action object. For example, to
   control the message printed when the action is taken you need to create
   the action object using Action.

   The Action factory function returns an appropriate object for the
   action represented by the type of the action argument (the first
   positional parmeter):
     * If the action argument is already an Action object, the object is
       simply returned.
     * If the action argument is a string, a command-line Action is
       returned. If such a string begins with @, it indicates printing of
       the command line is to be suppressed. If the string begins with -
       (hyphen), it indicates the exit status from the specified command
       is to be ignored, allowing execution to continue even if the
       command reports failure:
Action('$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES')

# Doesn't print the line being executed.
Action('@build $TARGET $SOURCES')

# Ignores return value
Action('-build $TARGET $SOURCES')

     * If the action argument is a list, then a list of Action objects is
       returned. An Action object is created as necessary for each element
       in the list. If an element within the list is itself a list, the
       internal list is taken as the command and arguments to be executed
       via the command line. This allows white space to be enclosed in an
       argument rather than taken as a separator by defining a command in
       a list within a list:
Action([['cc', '-c', '-DWHITE SPACE', '-o', '$TARGET', '$SOURCES']])

     * If the action argument is a Python function, a function Action is
       returned. The Python function must accept three keyword arguments:

       target - a Node object representing the target file.
       source - a Node object representing the source file.
       env - the construction environment used for building the target file.
       The target and source arguments may be lists of Node objects if
       there is more than one target file or source file. The actual
       target and source file name(s) may be retrieved from their Node
       objects via the built-in Python str function:
target_file_name = str(target)
source_file_names = [str(x) for x in source]

       The function should return 0 or None to indicate a successful build
       of the target file(s). The function may raise an exception or
       return a non-zero exit status to indicate an unsuccessful build.
def build_it(target=None, source=None, env=None):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

a = Action(build_it)

     * If the action argument is not one of the above types, None is
       returned.

   As usual the environment method form [1770]env.Action will expand
   construction variables in any argument strings, including the action
   argument, at the time it is called, using the construction variables in
   the construction environment through which it was called. The global
   function form [1771]Action delays variable expansion until the Action
   object is actually used.

   The optional second argument to Action is used to control the output
   which is printed when the Action is actually performed. If this
   parameter is omitted, or if the value is an empty string, a default
   output depending on the type of the action is used. For example, a
   command-line action will print the executed command. The following
   argument types are accepted:
     * If the output argument is a function, the function will be called
       to obtain a string describing the action being executed. The
       function must accept these three keyword arguments:

       source - a Node object representing the source file.
       target - a Node object representing the target file.
       env - the construction environment.
       The target and source arguments may be lists of Node objects if
       there is more than one target file or source file.
     * If the output argument is a string, substitution is performed on
       the string before it is printed. The string typically contains
       variables, notably $TARGET(S) and $SOURCE(S), or consists of just a
       single variable, which is optionally defined somewhere else. SCons
       itself heavily uses the latter variant.
     * If the argument is None, output is suppressed entirely.

   Instead of using a positional argument, the cmdstr keyword argument may
   be used to specify the output string, or the strfunction keyword
   argument may be used to specify a function to return the output string,
   Use cmdstr=None to suppress output.

   Examples:
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

def string_it(target, source, env):
    return "building '%s' from '%s'" % (target[0], source[0])

# Use a positional argument.
f = Action(build_it, string_it)
s = Action(build_it, "building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'")

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
f = Action(build_it, strfunction=string_it)
s = Action(build_it, cmdstr="building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'")

# You can provide a configurable variable.
l = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT')

   Any additional positional arguments, if present, may either be
   construction variables or lists of construction variables whose values
   will be included in the signature of the Action when deciding whether a
   target should be rebuilt because the action changed. Such variables may
   also be specified using the varlist keyword parameter; both positional
   and keyword forms may be present, and will be combined. This is
   necessary whenever you want a target to be rebuilt when a specific
   construction variable changes. This is not often needed for a string
   action, as the expanded variables will normally be part of the command
   line, but may be needed if a Python function action uses the value of a
   construction variable when generating the command line.
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the 'XXX' construction variable
    with open(target[0], 'w') as f:
        f.write(env['XXX'])
    return 0

# Use positional arguments.
a = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT', ['XXX'])

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
a = Action(build_it, varlist=['XXX'])

   The Action factory function can be passed the following optional
   keyword arguments to modify the Action object's behavior:

   chdir
          Specifies that scons will execute the action after changing to
          the specified directory. If the chdir argument is a string or a
          directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory. If
          the chdir argument is not a string or Node and is non-zero, then
          scons will change to the target file's directory.

          Note that scons will not automatically modify its expansion of
          construction variables like $TARGET and $SOURCE when using the
          chdir keyword argument--that is, the expanded file names will
          still be relative to the top-level directory containing the
          SConstruct file, and consequently incorrect relative to the
          chdir directory. Builders created using chdir keyword argument,
          will need to use construction variable expansions like
          ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to use just the filename
          portion of the targets and source. Example:

a = Action("build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}",
           chdir=1)

   exitstatfunc
          A function that is passed the exit status (or return value) from
          the specified action and can return an arbitrary or modified
          value. This can be used, for example, to specify that an Action
          object's return value should be ignored under special conditions
          and SCons should, therefore, consider that the action always
          succeeds. Example:

def always_succeed(s):
    # Always return 0, which indicates success.
    return 0

a = Action("build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}",
           exitstatfunc=always_succeed)

   batch_key
          Specifies that the Action can create multiple target files by
          processing multiple independent source files simultaneously.
          (The canonical example is "batch compilation" of multiple object
          files by passing multiple source files to a single invocation of
          a compiler such as Microsoft's Visual C / C++ compiler.) If the
          batch_key argument evaluates True and is not a callable object,
          the configured Action object will cause scons to collect all
          targets built with the Action object and configured with the
          same construction environment into single invocations of the
          Action object's command line or function. Command lines will
          typically want to use the $CHANGED_SOURCES construction variable
          (and possibly $CHANGED_TARGETS as well) to only pass to the
          command line those sources that have actually changed since
          their targets were built. Example:

a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=True)

          The batch_key argument may also be a callable function that
          returns a key that will be used to identify different "batches"
          of target files to be collected for batch building. A batch_key
          function must accept the following arguments:

          action - The action object.
          env - The construction environment configured for the target.
          target - The list of targets for a particular configured action.
          source - The list of source for a particular configured action.

          The returned key should typically be a tuple of values derived
          from the arguments, using any appropriate logic to decide how
          multiple invocations should be batched. For example, a batch_key
          function may decide to return the value of a specific
          construction variable from the env argument which will cause
          scons to batch-build targets with matching values of that
          variable, or perhaps return the Python id() of the entire
          construction environment, in which case scons will batch-build
          all targets configured with the same construction environment.
          Returning None indicates that the particular target should not
          be part of any batched build, but instead will be built by a
          separate invocation of action's command or function. Example:

def batch_key(action, env, target, source):
    tdir = target[0].dir
    if tdir.name == 'special':
        # Don't batch-build any target
        # in the special/ subdirectory.
        return None
    return (id(action), id(env), tdir)
a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=batch_key)

Miscellaneous Action Functions

   scons supplies a number of functions that arrange for various common
   file and directory manipulations to be performed. These are similar in
   concept to "tasks" in the Ant build tool, although the implementation
   is slightly different. These functions do not actually perform the
   specified action at the time the function is called, but rather are
   factory functions which return an Action object that can be executed at
   the appropriate time.

   In practice, there are two natural ways that these Action Functions are
   intended to be used.

   First, if you need to perform the action at the time the SConscript
   file is being read, you can use the [1772]Execute global function to do
   so:
Execute(Touch('file'))

   Second, you can use these functions to supply Actions in a list for use
   by the [1773]env.Command method. This can allow you to perform more
   complicated sequences of file manipulation without relying on
   platform-specific external commands:
env = Environment(TMPBUILD='/tmp/builddir')
env.Command(
    target='foo.out',
    source='foo.in',
    action=[
        Mkdir('$TMPBUILD'),
        Copy('$TMPBUILD', '${SOURCE.dir}'),
        "cd $TMPBUILD && make",
        Delete('$TMPBUILD'),
    ],
)

   Chmod(dest, mode)
          Returns an Action object that changes the permissions on the
          specified dest file or directory to the specified mode which can
          be octal or string, similar to the bash command. Examples:

Execute(Chmod('file', 0o755))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'),
             Chmod('$TARGET', 0o755)])

Execute(Chmod('file', "ugo+w"))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'),
             Chmod('$TARGET', "ugo+w")])

   Copy(dest, src)
          Returns an Action object that will copy the src source file or
          directory to the dest destination file or directory. Examples:

Execute(Copy('foo.output', 'foo.input'))

env.Command('bar.out', 'bar.in', Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'))

   Delete(entry, [must_exist])
          Returns an Action that deletes the specified entry, which may be
          a file or a directory tree. If a directory is specified, the
          entire directory tree will be removed. If the must_exist flag is
          set to a true value, then a Python error will be raised if the
          specified entry does not exist; the default is false, that is,
          the Action will silently do nothing if the entry does not exist.
          Examples:

Execute(Delete('/tmp/buildroot'))

env.Command(
    'foo.out',
    'foo.in',
    action=[
        Delete('${TARGET.dir}'),
        MyBuildAction,
    ],
)

Execute(Delete('file_that_must_exist', must_exist=True))

   Mkdir(dir)
          Returns an Action that creates the specified directory dir.
          Examples:

Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/outputdir'))

env.Command(
    'foo.out',
    'foo.in',
    action=[
        Mkdir('/tmp/builddir'),
        Copy('/tmp/builddir/foo.in', '$SOURCE'),
        "cd /tmp/builddir && make",
        Copy('$TARGET', '/tmp/builddir/foo.out'),
    ],
)

   Move(dest, src)
          Returns an Action that moves the specified src file or directory
          to the specified dest file or directory. Examples:

Execute(Move('file.destination', 'file.source'))

env.Command(
    'output_file',
    'input_file',
    action=[MyBuildAction, Move('$TARGET', 'file_created_by_MyBuildAction')],
)

   Touch(file)
          Returns an Action that updates the modification time on the
          specified file. Examples:

Execute(Touch('file_to_be_touched'))

env.Command('marker', 'input_file', action=[MyBuildAction, Touch('$TARGET')])

Variable Substitution

   Before executing a command, scons performs variable substitution on the
   string that makes up the action part of the builder. Variables to be
   interpolated are indicated in the string with a leading $, to
   distinguish them from plain text which is not to be substituted. The
   name may be surrounded by curly braces (${}) to separate the name from
   surrounding characters if necessary. Curly braces are required when you
   use Python list subscripting/slicing notation on a variable to select
   one or more items from a list, or access a variable's special
   attributes, or use Python expression substitution.

   Besides regular construction variables, scons provides the following
   special variables for use in expanding commands:

   $CHANGED_SOURCES
          The file names of all sources of the build command that have
          changed since the target was last built.

   $CHANGED_TARGETS
          The file names of all targets that would be built from sources
          that have changed since the target was last built.

   $SOURCE
          The file name of the source of the build command, or the file
          name of the first source if multiple sources are being built.

   $SOURCES
          The file names of the sources of the build command.

   $TARGET
          The file name of the target being built, or the file name of the
          first target if multiple targets are being built.

   $TARGETS
          The file names of all targets being built.

   $UNCHANGED_SOURCES
          The file names of all sources of the build command that have not
          changed since the target was last built.

   $UNCHANGED_TARGETS
          The file names of all targets that would be built from sources
          that have not changed since the target was last built.

   These names are reserved and may not be assigned to or used as
   construction variables.

   For example, the following builder call:
env = Environment(CC='cc')
env.Command(
    target=['foo'],
    source=['foo.c', 'bar.c'],
    action='@echo $CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES'
)

   would produce the following output:
cc -c -o foo foo.c bar.c

   In the previous example, a string ${SOURCES[1]} would expand to: bar.c.

   A variable name may have the following modifiers appended within the
   enclosing curly braces to access properties of the interpolated string.
   These are known as special attributes.
   base - The base path of the file name, including the directory path but
   excluding any suffix.
   dir - The name of the directory in which the file exists.
   file - The file name, minus any directory portion.
   filebase - Like file but minus its suffix.
   suffix - Just the file suffix.
   abspath - The absolute path name of the file.
   posix - The path with directories separated by forward slashes (/).
   Sometimes necessary on Windows systems when a path references a file on
   other (POSIX) systems.
   windows - The path with directories separated by backslashes (\\).
   Sometimes necessary on POSIX-style systems when a path references a
   file on other (Windows) systems. win32 is a (deprecated) synonym for
   windows.
   srcpath - The directory and file name to the source file linked to this
   file through VariantDir(). If this file isn't linked, it just returns
   the directory and filename unchanged.
   srcdir - The directory containing the source file linked to this file
   through VariantDir(). If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
   directory part of the filename.
   rsrcpath - The directory and file name to the source file linked to
   this file through VariantDir(). If the file does not exist locally but
   exists in a Repository, the path in the Repository is returned. If this
   file isn't linked, it just returns the directory and filename
   unchanged.
   rsrcdir - The Repository directory containing the source file linked to
   this file through VariantDir(). If this file isn't linked, it just
   returns the directory part of the filename.

   For example, the specified target will expand as follows for the
   corresponding modifiers:
$TARGET              => sub/dir/file.x
${TARGET.base}       => sub/dir/file
${TARGET.dir}        => sub/dir
${TARGET.file}       => file.x
${TARGET.filebase}   => file
${TARGET.suffix}     => .x
${TARGET.abspath}    => /top/dir/sub/dir/file.x

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='sub/dir')
$SOURCE              => sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.srcpath}    => src/file.x
${SOURCE.srcdir}     => src

Repository('/usr/repository')
$SOURCE              => sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcpath}   => /usr/repository/src/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcdir}    => /usr/repository/src

   Some modifiers can be combined, like ${TARGET.srcpath.base),
   ${TARGET.file.suffix}, etc.

   The curly brace notation may also be used to enclose a Python
   expression to be evaluated. See [1774]the section called "Python Code
   Substitution" below for a description.

   A variable name may also be a Python function associated with a
   construction variable in the environment. The function should accept
   four arguments:
   target - a list of target nodes
   source - a list of source nodes
   env - the construction environment
   for_signature - a Boolean value that specifies whether the function is
   being called for generating a build signature.

   SCons will insert whatever the called function returns into the
   expanded string:
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return "bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="$FOO baz")

   As a reminder, this evaluation happens when $BAR is actually used in a
   builder action. The value of env['BAR'] will be exactly as it was set:
   "$FOO baz".

   You can use this feature to pass arguments to a Python function by
   creating a callable class that stores one or more arguments in an
   object, and then uses them when the __call__() method is called. Note
   that in this case, the entire variable expansion must be enclosed by
   curly braces so that the arguments will be associated with the
   instantiation of the class:
class foo:
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
        return self.arg + " bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "my argument bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="${FOO('my argument')} baz")

   The special pseudo-variables $( and $) may be used to surround parts of
   a command line that may change without causing a rebuild--that is,
   which are not included in the signature of target files built with this
   command. All text between $( and $) will be removed from the command
   line before it is added to file signatures, and the $( and $) will be
   removed before the command is executed. For example, the command line:
echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $). > $TARGET

   would execute the command:
echo Last build occurred $TODAY. > $TARGET

   but the command signature added to any target files would be:
echo Last build occurred  . > $TARGET

Python Code Substitution

   If a substitutable expression using the notation ${something} does not
   appear to match one of the other substitution patterns, it is evaluated
   as a Python expression. This uses Python's eval function, with the
   globals parameter set to the current environment's set of construction
   variables, and the result substituted in. So in the following case:
env.Command(
    'foo.out', 'foo.in', "echo ${COND==1 and 'FOO' or 'BAR'} > $TARGET"
)

   the command executed will be either
echo FOO > foo.out

   or
echo BAR > foo.out

   according to the current value of env['COND'] when the command is
   executed. The evaluation takes place when the target is being built,
   not when the SConscript is being read. So if env['COND'] is changed
   later in the SConscript, the final value will be used.

   Here's a more complete example. Note that all of COND, FOO, and BAR are
   construction variables, and their values are substituted into the final
   command. FOO is a list, so its elements are interpolated separated by
   spaces.
env=Environment()
env['COND'] = 1
env['FOO'] = ['foo1', 'foo2']
env['BAR'] = 'barbar'
env.Command(
    'foo.out', 'foo.in', "echo ${COND==1 and FOO or BAR} > $TARGET"
)

   will execute:
echo foo1 foo2 > foo.out

   In point of fact, Python expression evaluation is how the special
   attributes are substituted: they are simply attributes of the Python
   objects that represent $TARGET, $SOURCES, etc., which SCons passes to
   eval which returns the value.

   SCons uses the following rules when converting construction variables
   into command lines:

   string
          When the value is a string it is interpreted as a space
          delimited list of command line arguments.

   list
          When the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command
          line arguments. Each element of the list is converted to a
          string.

   other
          Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string
          and interpreted as a single command line argument.

   newline
          Newline characters (\n) delimit lines. The newline parsing is
          done after all other parsing, so it is not possible for
          arguments (e.g. file names) to contain embedded newline
          characters.

Note

   Use of the Python eval function is considered to have security
   implications, since, depending on input sources, arbitrary unchecked
   strings of code can be executed by the Python interpreter. Although
   SCons makes use of it in a somewhat restricted context, you should be
   aware of this issue when using the ${python-expression-for-subst} form.

Scanner Objects

   You can use the [1775]Scanner function to define objects to scan new
   file types for implicit dependencies. The Scanner function accepts the
   following arguments:

   function
          This can be either:

          + a Python function that will process the Node (file) and return
            a list of File Nodes representing the implicit dependencies
            (file names) found in the contents.
          + a dictionary that maps keys (typically the file suffix, but
            see below for more discussion) to other Scanners that should
            be called.

          If the argument is a Python function, the function must accept
          three required arguments and an optional fourth:

   node - The internal SCons node representing the file. Use str(node) to
   fetch the name of the file, and node.get_contents() to fetch the
   contents of the file as bytes or node.get_text_contents() to fetch the
   contents as text. Note that the file is not guaranteed to exist before
   the scanner is called, so the scanner function should check that if
   there's any chance that the scanned file might not exist (for example,
   if it's built from other files).
          env - The construction environment for the scan.
   path - A tuple (or list) of directories that can be searched for files.
   This will usually be the tuple returned by the path_function argument
   (see below).
   arg - The argument supplied when the scanner was created, if any
   (default None.

   name
          The name of the Scanner. This is mainly used to identify the
          Scanner internally. The default value is "NONE".

   argument
          An optional argument that, if specified, will be passed to the
          scanner function (described above) and the path function
          (specified below).

   skeys
          An optional list that can be used to determine which scanner
          should be used for a given Node. In the usual case of scanning
          for file names, this argument will be a list of suffixes for the
          different file types that this Scanner knows how to scan. If the
          argument is a string, then it will be expanded into a list by
          the current environment.

   path_function
          A Python function that takes four or five arguments: a
          construction environment, a Node for the directory containing
          the SConscript file in which the first target was defined, a
          list of target nodes, a list of source nodes, and an optional
          argument supplied when the scanner was created. The
          path_function returns a tuple of directories that can be
          searched for files to be returned by this Scanner object. (Note
          that the [1776]FindPathDirs function can be used to return a
          ready-made path_function for a given construction variable name,
          instead of having to write your own function from scratch.)

   node_class
          The class of Node that should be returned by this Scanner
          object. Any strings or other objects returned by the scanner
          function that are not of this class will be run through the
          function supplied by the node_factory argument.

   node_factory
          A Python function that will take a string or other object and
          turn it into the appropriate class of Node to be returned by
          this Scanner object.

   scan_check
          An optional Python function that takes two arguments, a Node
          (file) and a construction environment, and returns whether the
          Node should, in fact, be scanned for dependencies. This check
          can be used to eliminate unnecessary calls to the scanner
          function when, for example, the underlying file represented by a
          Node does not yet exist.

   recursive
          An optional flag that specifies whether this scanner should be
          re-invoked on the dependency files returned by the scanner. When
          this flag is not set, the Node subsystem will only invoke the
          scanner on the file being scanned, and not (for example) also on
          the files specified by the #include lines in the file being
          scanned. recursive may be a callable function, in which case it
          will be called with a list of Nodes found and should return a
          list of Nodes that should be scanned recursively; this can be
          used to select a specific subset of Nodes for additional
          scanning.

   Note that scons has a global SourceFileScanner object that is used by
   the [1777]Object, [1778]SharedObject and [1779]StaticObject builders to
   decide which scanner should be used for different file extensions. You
   can use the SourceFileScanner.add_scanner() method to add your own
   Scanner object to the SCons infrastructure that builds target programs
   or libraries from a list of source files of different types:
def xyz_scan(node, env, path):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    # Scan the contents and return the included files.

XYZScanner = Scanner(xyz_scan)

SourceFileScanner.add_scanner('.xyz', XYZScanner)

env.Program('my_prog', ['file1.c', 'file2.f', 'file3.xyz'])

SYSTEM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR

   scons and its configuration files are very portable, due largely to its
   implementation in Python. There are, however, a few portability issues
   waiting to trap the unwary.

.C file suffix

   scons handles the upper-case .C file suffix differently, depending on
   the capabilities of the underlying system. On a case-sensitive system
   such as Linux or UNIX, scons treats a file with a .C suffix as a C++
   source file. On a case-insensitive system such as Windows, scons treats
   a file with a .C suffix as a C source file.

Fortran file suffixes

   scons handles upper-case Fortran file suffixes differently depending on
   the capabilities of the underlying system. On a case-sensitive system
   such as Linux or UNIX, scons treats a file with a .F as a Fortran
   source file that is to be first run through the standard C
   preprocessor, while the lower-case version is not. This matches the
   convention of gfortran, which may also be followed by other Fortran
   compilers. This also applies to other naming variants, .FOR, .FTN,
   .F90, .F95, .F03 and .F08; files suffixed with .FPP and .fpp are both
   run through the preprocessor, as indicated by the pp part of the name.
   On a case-insensitive system such as Windows, scons treats a file with
   a .F suffix as a Fortran source file that should not be run through the
   C preprocessor.

   Run through the C preprocessor here means that a different set of
   construction variables will be applied in constructed commands, for
   example [1780]$FORTRANPPCOM and [1781]$FORTRANPPCOMSTR instead of
   [1782]$FORTRANCOM and [1783]$FORTRANCOMSTR. See the Fortran-related
   construction variables for more details.

Windows: Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs. Windows Pythons

   Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities that let users work on a
   Windows system using a more POSIX-like environment. The Cygwin tools,
   including Cygwin Python, do this, in part, by sharing an ability to
   interpret UNIX-like path names. For example, the Cygwin tools will
   internally translate a Cygwin path name like /cygdrive/c/mydir to an
   equivalent Windows pathname of C:/mydir (equivalent to C:\mydir).

   Versions of Python that are built for native Windows execution, such as
   the python.org and ActiveState versions, do not have the Cygwin path
   name semantics. This means that using a native Windows version of
   Python to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools (such as gcc,
   bison and flex) may yield unpredictable results. "Mixing and matching"
   in this way can be made to work, but it requires careful attention to
   the use of path names in your SConscript files.

   In practice, users can sidestep the issue by adopting the following
   rules: When using gcc, use the Cygwin-supplied Python interpreter to
   run scons; when using Microsoft Visual C/C++ (or some other Windows
   compiler) use the python.org or Microsoft Store or ActiveState version
   of Python to run scons.

Windows: scons.bat file

   On Windows systems, scons is executed via a wrapper scons.bat file.
   This has (at least) two ramifications:

   First, Windows command-line users that want to use variable assignment
   on the command line may have to put double quotes around the
   assignments:
scons "FOO=BAR" "BAZ=BLEH"

   Second, the Cygwin shell does not recognize this file as being the same
   as an scons command issued at the command-line prompt. You can work
   around this either by executing scons.bat from the Cygwin command line,
   or by creating a wrapper shell script named scons.

MinGW

   The MinGW bin directory must be in your PATH environment variable or
   the ['ENV']['PATH'] construction variable for scons to detect and use
   the MinGW tools. When running under the native Windows Python
   interpreter, scons will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin tools,
   if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin
   directories in the PATH variable. If you have both MSVC and MinGW
   installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC, then you must
   explicitly tell scons to use MinGW by passing tools=['mingw'] to the
   Environment function, because scons will prefer the MSVC tools over the
   MinGW tools.

ENVIRONMENT

   In general, scons is not controlled by environment variables set in the
   shell used to invoke it, leaving it up to the SConscript file author to
   import those if desired. However the following variables are imported
   by scons itself if set:

   SCONS_LIB_DIR
          Specifies the directory that contains the scons Python module
          directory. Normally scons can deduce this, but in some
          circumstances, such as working with a source release, it may be
          necessary to specify (for example,
          /home/aroach/scons-src-0.01/src/engine).

   SCONSFLAGS
          A string of options that will be used by scons in addition to
          those passed on the command line.

   SCONS_CACHE_MSVC_CONFIG
          (Windows only). If set, save the shell environment variables
          generated when setting up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
          (and/or Build Tools) to a file to give these settings, which are
          expensive to generate, persistence across scons invocations. Use
          of this option is primarily intended to aid performance in
          tightly controlled Continuous Integration setups.

          If set to a True-like value ("1", "true" or "True") will cache
          to a file named .scons_msvc_cache in the user's home directory.
          If set to a pathname, will use that pathname for the cache.

          Note: use this cache with caution as it might be somewhat
          fragile: while each major toolset version (e.g. Visual Studio
          2017 vs 2019) and architecture pair will get separate cache
          entries, if toolset updates cause a change to settings within a
          given release series, scons will not detect the change and will
          reuse old settings. Remove the cache file in case of problems
          with this. scons will ignore failures reading or writing the
          file and will silently revert to non-cached behavior in such
          cases.

          Available since scons 3.1 (experimental).
