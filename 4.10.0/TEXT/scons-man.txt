   scons -- a software construction tool

Synopsis

   scons [options...] [name=val...] [targets...]

DESCRIPTION

   SCons is an extensible open source build system that orchestrates the
   construction of software (and other tangible products such as
   documentation files) by determining which component pieces must be
   built or rebuilt and invoking the necessary commands to build them.
   SCons offers many features to improve developer productivity such as
   parallel builds, caching of build artifacts, automatic dependency
   scanning, and a database of information about previous builds so
   details do not have to be recalculated each run.

   scons requires Python 3.7 or later to run; there should be no other
   dependencies or requirements, unless the experimental Ninja tool is
   used (requires the ninja package).

   Changed in version 4.3.0: support for Python 3.5 is removed. The
   CPython project retired 3.5 in Sept 2020:
   [1]https://peps.python.org/pep-0478.

   Changed in version 4.9.0: support for Python 3.6 is removed. The
   CPython project retired 3.6 in Sept 2021:
   [2]https://peps.python.org/pep-0494.

   You set up an SCons build by writing a script that describes things to
   build (targets), and, if necessary, the rules to build those files
   (actions). SCons comes with a collection of Builder methods which
   supply premade Actions for building many common software components
   such as executable programs, object files and libraries, so that for
   many software projects, only the targets and input files (sources) need
   be specified in a call to a builder.

   SCons operates at a level of abstraction above that of pure filenames.
   For example if you specify a shared library target named "foo", SCons
   keeps track of the actual operating system dependent filename (such as
   libfoo.so on a GNU/Linux system and foo.dll on Windows), and gives you
   a handle to refer to that target in other steps, so you don't have to
   use system-specific strings yourself. SCons can also scan automatically
   for dependency information, such as header files included by source
   code files (for example, #include preprocessor directives in C or C++
   files), so these implicit dependencies do not have to be specified
   manually. SCons supports the ability to define new scanners to support
   additional input file types.

   Information about files involved in the build, including a
   cryptographic hash of the contents of source files, is cached for later
   reuse. By default, this hash (the content signature) is used to decide
   if a file has changed since the last build, although other algorithms
   can be used by selecting an appropriate [3]Decider function. Implicit
   dependency files are also part of out-of-date computation. The scanned
   implicit dependency information can optionally be cached and used to
   speed up future builds. A hash of each executed build action (the build
   signature) is also cached, so that changes to build instructions
   (changing flags, etc.) or to the build tools themselves (e.g. a
   compiler upgrade) can also trigger a rebuild.

   SCons supports separated source and build directories (also called
   "out-of-tree builds") through the definition of variant directories
   Using a separated build directory helps keep the source directory clean
   of artifacts when doing searches, allows setting up differing builds
   ("variants") without conflicts, and allows resetting the build by just
   removing the build directory (note that SCons does have a "clean" mode
   as well). See the [4]VariantDir description for more details.

   When invoked, scons looks for a file describing the build configuration
   in the current directory and reads that in. The file is by default
   named SConstruct, although some variants of that, or a developer-chosen
   name, are also accepted (see [5]the section called "SConscript Files").
   If found, the current directory is set as the project top directory.
   Certain command-line options specify alternate places to look for
   SConstruct (see [6]-C, [7]-D, [8]-u and [9]-U), which will set the
   project top directory to the path found. A path to the build
   configuration can also be specified with the [10]-f option, which
   leaves the current directory as the project top directory.

   The build configuration may be split into multiple files: the
   SConstruct file can specify additional configuration files by calling
   the [11]SConscript function, and any file thus invoked may include
   further files in the same way. By convention, these subsidiary files
   are named SConscript, although any name may be used. As a result of
   this naming convention, the term SConscript files is used to refer
   generically to the complete set of configuration files for a project
   (including the SConstruct file), regardless of the actual file names or
   number of such files. A hierarchical build is not recursive - all of
   the SConscript files are processed in a single pass so that scons has a
   picture of the complete dependency tree when it begins considering what
   needs building. Each SConscript file is processed in a separate context
   so settings made in one script do not leak into another; information
   can however be shared explicitly between scripts.

   Before reading the SConscript files, scons looks for a site directory -
   a directory named site_scons is searched for in various system
   directories and in the project top directory, or if the [12]--site-dir
   option is given, checks only for that directory. Found site directories
   are prepended to the Python module search path (sys.path), thus
   allowing modules in such directories to be imported in the normal
   Python way in SConscript files. For each found site directory, (1) if
   it contains a file site_init.py that file is evaluated, and (2) if it
   contains a directory site_tools the path to that directory is prepended
   to the default toolpath. See the [13]--site-dir and [14]--no-site-dir
   options for details on default paths and controlling the site
   directories.

   SConscript files are written in the Python programming language. For
   many tasks, the simple syntax can be understood from examples, so it is
   normally not necessary to be a Python programmer to use SCons
   effectively. SConscript files are executed in a context that makes the
   facilities described in this manual page directly available (that is,
   no need to import). Standard Python scripting capabilities such as flow
   control, data manipulation, and imported Python modules are available
   to use in more complicated build configurations. Other Python files can
   be made a part of the build system, but they do not automatically have
   the SCons context and need to import it if they need access (described
   later).

   SCons reads and executes all of the included SConscript files before it
   begins building any targets. Progress messages show this behavior (the
   state change lines - those beginning with the scons: tag - may be
   suppressed using the [15]-Q option):
$ scons foo.out
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets  ...
cp foo.in foo.out
scons: done building targets.
$

   To assure reproducible builds, SCons uses a restricted execution
   environment for running external commands used to build targets, rather
   than propagating the full environment in effect at the time scons was
   called. This helps avoid problems like picking up accidental or
   malicious settings, temporary debug values that are no longer needed,
   or a developer having different settings than another (or than the CI
   pipeline). Environment variables needed for the proper operation of
   such commands must be set in the execution environment explicitly,
   either by assigning the desired values, or by picking those values
   individually or collectively out of environment variables exposed by
   the Python os.environ dictionary (as external program inputs they
   should be validated before use). The execution environment for a given
   construction environment is its [16]$ENV value. A small number of
   environment variables are picked up automatically by scons itself (see
   [17]the section called "ENVIRONMENT").

   In particular, if a compiler or other external command needed to build
   a target file is not in scons' idea of a standard system location, it
   will not be found at runtime unless you explicitly add the location
   into the execution environment's PATH element. This is a particular
   consideration on Windows platforms, where it is common for a command to
   install into an app-specific location and depend on setting PATH in
   order for them to be found, which does not automatically work for
   SCons.

   One example approach is to extract the entire PATH environment variable
   and set that into the execution environment:
import os
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})

   Similarly, if the commands use specific external environment variables
   that scons does not recognize, they can be propagated into the
   execution environment:
import os

env = Environment(
    ENV={
        'PATH': os.environ['PATH'],
        'MODULEPATH': os.environ['MODULEPATH'],
        'PKG_CONFIG_PATH': os.environ['PKG_CONFIG_PATH'],
    }
)

   Or you can explicitly propagate the invoking user's complete external
   environment:
import os
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())

   This comes at the expense of making your build dependent on the user's
   environment being set correctly, but it may be more convenient for some
   configurations. It should not cause problems if done in a build setup
   which tightly controls how the environment is set up before invoking
   scons, as in many continuous integration setups.

Note

   The above fragments are intended to illustrate a concept. It is
   normally not a good idea to wipe out the entire default value of the
   execution environment (env["ENV"]), as it may carry important
   information for the execution of build commands.

   scons is normally executed in a top-level directory containing an
   SConstruct file (the project top directory). When scons is invoked, the
   command line (including the contents of the [18]SCONSFLAGS environment
   variable, if set) is processed. Command-line options (see [19]the
   section called "OPTIONS") are consumed. Any variable argument
   assignments are collected, and remaining arguments are taken as targets
   to build.

   Values of variables to be passed to the SConscript files may be
   specified on the command line:
scons debug=1

   These variables are available through the [20]ARGUMENTS dictionary, and
   can be used in the SConscript files to modify the build in any way:
if ARGUMENTS.get("debug", ""):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS="-g")
else:
    env = Environment()

   The command-line variable arguments are also available in the
   [21]ARGLIST list, indexed by their order on the command line. This
   allows you to process them in order rather than by name, if necessary.
   Each ARGLIST entry is a tuple consisting of the name and the value.

   See [22]the section called "Command-Line Construction Variables" for
   more information.

   scons can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can be shared
   between multiple builds. When derived-file caching is enabled in an
   SConscript file, any target files built by scons will be copied to the
   cache. If an up-to-date target file is found in the cache, it will be
   retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally. Caching
   behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
   [23]--cache-force, [24]--cache-disable, [25]--cache-readonly, and
   [26]--cache-show command-line options. The [27]--random option is
   useful to prevent multiple builds from trying to update the cache
   simultaneously.

   By default, scons searches for known programming tools on various
   systems and initializes itself based on what is found. On Windows
   systems which identify as win32, scons searches in order for the
   Microsoft Visual C++ tools, the MinGW tool chain, the Intel compiler
   tools, the GCC tools, the LLVM/clang tools, and the PharLap ETS
   compiler. On Windows system which identify as cygwin (that is, if scons
   is invoked from a cygwin shell), the order changes to prefer the GCC
   toolchain over the MSVC tools. On OS/2 systems, scons searches in order
   for the OS/2 compiler, the GCC tool chain, and the Microsoft Visual C++
   tools, On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP-UX, and Oracle Solaris
   systems, scons searches for the native compiler tools (MIPSpro, Visual
   Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively) and the GCC tool chain. On all
   other platforms, including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) and macOS platforms,
   scons searches in order for the GCC tool chain, the LLVM/clang tools,
   and the Intel compiler tools. The default tool selection can be
   pre-empted through the use of the tools argument to construction
   environment creation methods, explicitly calling the [28]Tool loader,
   the through the setting of various setting of construction variables.

Target Selection

   SCons acts on the selected targets, whether the requested operation is
   build, no-exec or clean. Targets are selected as follows:
    1. Targets specified on the command line. These may be files,
       directories, or phony targets defined using the [29]Alias function.
       Directory targets are scanned by scons for any targets that may be
       found with a destination in or under that directory. The targets
       listed on the command line are made available in the
       [30]COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS list.
    2. If no targets are specified on the command line, scons will select
       those targets specified in the SConscript files via calls to the
       [31]Default function. These are known as the default targets, and
       are made available in the [32]DEFAULT_TARGETS list.
    3. If no targets are selected by the previous steps, scons selects the
       current directory for scanning, unless command-line options which
       affect the directory for target scanning are present ([33]-C,
       [34]-D, [35]-u, [36]-U). Since targets thus selected were not the
       result of user instructions, this target list is not made available
       for direct inspection; use the [37]--debug=explain option if they
       need to be examined.
    4. scons always adds to the selected targets any intermediate targets
       which are necessary to build the specified ones. For example, if
       constructing a shared library or dll from C source files, scons
       will also build the object files which will make up the library.

   To ignore the default targets specified through calls to Default and
   instead build all target files in or below the current directory
   specify the current directory (.) as a command-line target:
scons .

   To build all target files, including any files outside of the current
   directory, supply a command-line target of the root directory (on POSIX
   systems):
scons /

   or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets should be
   built (on Windows systems):
scons C:\ D:\

   A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by remaining at the
   project top directory and specifying the subdirectory as the target to
   build:
scons src/subdir

   or by changing directory and invoking scons with the [38]-u option,
   which traverses up the directory hierarchy until it finds the
   SConstruct file, and then builds targets relatively to the current
   subdirectory (see also the related [39]-D and [40]-U options):
cd src/subdir
scons -u .

   In all cases, more files may be built than are requested, as scons
   needs to make sure any dependent files are built.

   Specifying "cleanup" targets in SConscript files is usually not
   necessary. The [41]-c flag removes all selected targets:
scons -c .

   to remove all target files in or under the current directory, or:
scons -c build export

   to remove target files under build and export.

   Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
   [42]Clean function in the SConscript files. Conversely, targets that
   would normally be removed by the -c invocation can be retained by
   calling the [43]NoClean function with those targets.

   scons supports building multiple targets in parallel via a [44]-j
   option that takes, as its argument, the number of simultaneous tasks
   that may be spawned:
scons -j 4

   builds four targets in parallel, for example.

OPTIONS

   In general, scons supports the same command-line options as GNU Make
   and many of those supported by cons.

   -b
          Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of Make

   -c, --clean, --remove
          Set clean mode. Clean up by removing the selected targets, well
          as any files or directories associated with a selected target
          through calls to the [45]Clean function. Will not remove any
          targets which are marked for preservation through calls to the
          [46]NoClean function.

          While clean mode removes targets rather than building them, work
          which is done directly in Python code in SConscript files will
          still be carried out. If it is important to avoid some such work
          from taking place in clean mode, it should be protected. An
          SConscript file can determine which mode is active by querying
          [47]GetOption, as in the call if GetOption("clean"):

   --cache-debug=file
          Write debug information about derived-file caching to the
          specified file. If file is a hyphen (-), the debug information
          is printed to the standard output. The printed messages describe
          what signature-file names are being looked for in, retrieved
          from, or written to the derived-file cache specified by
          [48]CacheDir.

   --cache-disable, --no-cache
          Disable derived-file caching. scons will neither retrieve files
          from the cache nor copy files to the cache. This option can be
          used to temporarily disable the cache without modifying the
          build scripts.

   --cache-force, --cache-populate
          When using [49]CacheDir, populate a derived-file cache by
          copying any already-existing, up-to-date derived files to the
          cache, in addition to files built by this invocation. This is
          useful to populate a new cache with all the current derived
          files, or to add to the cache any derived files recently built
          with caching disabled via the --cache-disable option.

   --cache-readonly
          Use the derived-file cache, if enabled, to retrieve files, but
          do not not update the cache with any files actually built during
          this invocation.

   --cache-show
          When using a derived-file cache, show the command that would
          have been executed to build the file (or the corresponding
          *COMSTR contents if set) even if the file is retrieved from
          cache. Without this option, scons shows a cache retrieval
          message if the file is fetched from cache. This allows producing
          consistent output for build logs, regardless of whether a target
          file was rebuilt or retrieved from the cache.

   --config=mode
          Control how the [50]Configure call should use or generate the
          results of configuration tests. mode should be one of the
          following choices:

        auto
                SCons will use its normal dependency mechanisms to decide
                if a test must be rebuilt or not. This saves time by not
                running the same configuration tests every time you invoke
                scons, but will overlook changes in system header files or
                external commands (such as compilers) if you don't specify
                those dependencies explicitly. This is the default
                behavior.

        force
                If this mode is specified, all configuration tests will be
                re-run regardless of whether the cached results are
                out-of-date. This can be used to explicitly force the
                configuration tests to be updated in response to an
                otherwise unconfigured change in a system header file or
                compiler.

        cache
                If this mode is specified, no configuration tests will be
                rerun and all results will be taken from cache. scons will
                report an error if --config=cache is specified and a
                necessary test does not have any results in the cache.

   -C directory, --directory=directory
          Run as if scons was started in directory instead of the current
          working directory. That is, change directory before searching
          for the SConstruct, Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py,
          Sconstruct.py or sconstruct.py file or doing anything else. When
          multiple -C options are given, each subsequent non-absolute -C
          directory is interpreted relative to the preceding one. See also
          options [51]-u, [52]-U and [53]-D to change the SConstruct
          search behavior when this option is used.

   -D
          Works exactly the same way as the [54]-u option except for the
          way default targets are handled. When this option is used and no
          targets are specified on the command line, all default targets
          are built, whether or not they are below the current directory.

   --debug=type[,type...]
          Debug the build process. type specifies the kind of debugging
          info to emit. Multiple types may be specified, separated by
          commas. The following types are recognized:

        action-timestamps
                Prints additional time profiling information. For each
                command, shows the absolute start and end times. This may
                be useful in debugging parallel builds. Implies the
                --debug=time option.

                New in version 3.1.

        count
                Print how many objects are created of the various classes
                used internally by SCons before and after reading the
                SConscript files and before and after building targets.
                This is not supported when SCons is executed with the
                Python -O (optimized) option or when the SCons modules
                have been compiled with optimization (that is, when
                executing from *.pyo files).

        duplicate
                Print a line for each unlink/relink (or copy) of a file in
                a variant directory from its source file. Includes
                debugging info for unlinking stale variant directory
                files, as well as unlinking old targets before building
                them.

        explain
                Print an explanation of why scons is deciding to
                (re-)build the targets it selects for building.

        findlibs
                Instruct the scanner that searches for libraries to print
                a message about each potential library name it is
                searching for, and about the actual libraries it finds.

        includes
                Print the include tree after each top-level target is
                built. This is generally used to find out what files are
                included by the sources of a given derived file:

$ scons --debug=includes foo.o

        json
                Write info to a JSON file for any of the following debug
                options if they are enabled: memory, count, time,
                action-timestamps

                The default output file is scons_stats.json

                The file name/path can be modified by using
                [55]DebugOptions for example
                DebugOptions(json='path/to/file.json')

$ scons --debug=memory,json foo.o

        memoizer
                Prints a summary of hits and misses using the Memoizer, an
                internal subsystem that counts how often SCons uses cached
                values in memory instead of recomputing them each time
                they're needed.

        memory
                Prints how much memory SCons uses before and after reading
                the SConscript files and before and after building
                targets.

        objects
                Prints a list of the various objects of the various
                classes used internally by SCons.

        pdb
                Run scons under control of the pdb Python debugger.

$ scons --debug=pdb
> /usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/SCons/Script/Main.py(869)_main()
-> options = parser.values
(Pdb)

Note

                pdb will stop at the beginning of the scons main routine
                on startup. The search path (sys.path) at that point will
                include the location of the running scons, but not of the
                project itself. If you need to set breakpoints in your
                project files, you will either need to add to the path, or
                use absolute pathnames when referring to project files. A
                .pdbrc file in the project root can be used to add the
                current directory to the search path to avoid having to
                enter it by hand, along these lines:

sys.path.append('.')

                Due to the implementation of the pdb module, the break,
                tbreak and clear commands only understand references to
                filenames which have a .py extension. (although the suffix
                itself can be omitted), except if you use an absolute
                path. As a special exception to that rule, the names
                SConstruct and SConscript are recognized without needing
                the .py extension.

                Changed in version 4.6.0: The names SConstruct and
                SConscript are now recognized without requiring .py
                suffix.

                Changed in version 4.8.0: The name SCsub is now recognized
                without requiring .py suffix.

        prepare
                Print a line each time any target (internal or external)
                is prepared for building. scons prints this for each
                target it considers, even if that target is up-to-date
                (see also --debug=explain). This can help debug problems
                with targets that aren't being built; it shows whether
                scons is at least considering them or not.

        presub
                Print the raw command line used to build each target
                before the construction environment variables are
                substituted. Also shows which targets are being built by
                this command. Output looks something like this:

$ scons --debug=presub
Building myprog.o with action(s):
  $SHCC $SHCFLAGS $SHCCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES
...

        stacktrace
                Prints an internal Python stack trace when encountering an
                otherwise unexplained error.

        time
                Prints various time profiling information:

               o The time spent executing each individual build command
               o The total build time (time SCons ran from beginning to
                 end)
               o The total time spent reading and executing SConscript
                 files
               o The total time SCons itself spent running (that is, not
                 counting reading and executing SConscript files)
               o The total time spent executing all build commands
               o The elapsed wall-clock time spent executing those build
                 commands
               o The time spent processing each file passed to the
                 [56]SConscript function

                (When scons is executed without the [57]-j option, the
                elapsed wall-clock time will typically be slightly longer
                than the total time spent executing all the build
                commands, due to the SCons processing that takes place in
                between executing each command. When scons is executed
                with the [58]-j option, and your build configuration
                allows good parallelization, the elapsed wall-clock time
                should be significantly smaller than the total time spent
                executing all the build commands, since multiple build
                commands and intervening SCons processing should take
                place in parallel.)

        sconscript
                Enables output indicating entering and exiting each
                SConscript file.

   --diskcheck=type
          Enable specific checks for whether or not there is a file on
          disk where the SCons configuration expects a directory (or vice
          versa) when searching for source and include files. type can be
          an available diskcheck type or the special tokens all or none. A
          comma-separated string can be used to select multiple checks.
          The default setting is all.

          Current available checks are:

        match
                to check that files and directories on disk match SCons'
                expected configuration.

          Disabling some or all of these checks can provide a performance
          boost for large configurations, or when the configuration will
          check for files and/or directories across networked or shared
          file systems, at the slight increased risk of an incorrect build
          or of not handling errors gracefully.

   --duplicate=ORDER
          There are three ways to duplicate files in a build tree: hard
          links, soft (symbolic) links and copies. The default policy is
          to prefer hard links to soft links to copies. You can specify a
          different policy with this option. ORDER must be one of
          hard-soft-copy (the default), soft-hard-copy, hard-copy,
          soft-copy or copy. SCons will attempt to duplicate files using
          the mechanisms in the specified order.

   --enable-virtualenv
          Import virtualenv-related variables to SCons.

   --experimental=feature
          Enable experimental features and/or tools. feature can be an
          available feature name or the special tokens all or none. A
          comma-separated string can be used to select multiple features.
          The default setting is none.

          Current available features are: ninja (New in version 4.2),
          legacy_sched (New in version 4.6.0).

Caution

          No Support offered for any features or tools enabled by this
          flag.

          New in version 4.2 (experimental).

   -f file, --file=file, --makefile=file, --sconstruct=file
          Use file as the initial SConscript file. Multiple -f options may
          be specified, in which case scons will read all of the specified
          files.

   -h, --help
          Print a local help message for this project, if one is defined
          in the SConscript files (see the [59]Help function), plus a line
          that refers to the standard SCons help message. If no local help
          message is defined, prints the standard SCons help message (as
          for the -H option) plus help for any local options defined
          through [60]AddOption. Exits after displaying the appropriate
          message.

          Note that use of this option requires SCons to process the
          SConscript files, so syntax errors may cause the help message
          not to be displayed.

   --hash-chunksize=KILOBYTES
          Set the block size used when computing content signatures to
          KILOBYTES. This value determines the size of the chunks which
          are read in at once when computing signature hashes. Files below
          that size are fully stored in memory before performing the
          signature computation while bigger files are read in
          block-by-block. A huge block-size leads to high memory
          consumption while a very small block-size slows down the build
          considerably.

          The default value is to use a chunk size of 64 kilobytes, which
          should be appropriate for most uses.

          New in version 4.1.

   --hash-format=ALGORITHM
          Set the hashing algorithm used by SCons to ALGORITHM. This value
          determines the hashing algorithm used in generating content
          signatures, build signatures and CacheDir keys.

          The supported list of values are: md5, sha1 and sha256. However,
          the Python interpreter used to run scons must have the
          corresponding support available in the hashlib module to use the
          specified algorithm.

          If this option is omitted, the first supported hash format found
          is selected. Typically, this is MD5, however, on a
          FIPS-compliant system using a version of Python older than 3.9,
          SHA1 or SHA256 is chosen as the default. Python 3.9 and onwards
          clients always default to MD5, even in FIPS mode.

          Specifying this option changes the name of the SConsign
          database. The default database is .sconsign.dblite. In the
          presence of this option, ALGORITHM is included in the name to
          indicate the difference, even if the argument is md5. For
          example, --hash-format=sha256 uses a SConsign database named
          .sconsign_sha256.dblite.

          New in version 4.1.

   -H, --help-options
          Print the standard help message about SCons command-line options
          and exit.

   -i, --ignore-errors
          Ignore all errors from commands executed to rebuild files.

   -I directory, --include-dir=directory
          Specifies a directory to search for imported Python modules. If
          several -I options are used, the directories are searched in the
          order specified.

   --ignore-virtualenv
          Suppress importing virtualenv-related variables to SCons.

   --implicit-cache
          Cache implicit dependencies. This causes scons to use the
          implicit (scanned) dependencies from the last time it was run
          instead of scanning the files for implicit dependencies. This
          can significantly speed up SCons, but with the following
          limitations:

          scons will not detect changes to implicit dependency search
          paths (e.g. [61]$CPPPATH, [62]$LIBPATH) that would ordinarily
          cause different versions of same-named files to be used.

          scons will miss changes in the implicit dependencies in cases
          where a new implicit dependency is added earlier in the implicit
          dependency search path (e.g. [63]$CPPPATH, [64]$LIBPATH) than a
          current implicit dependency with the same name.

   --implicit-deps-changed
          Forces SCons to ignore the cached implicit dependencies. This
          causes the implicit dependencies to be rescanned and recached.
          This implies --implicit-cache.

   --implicit-deps-unchanged
          Force SCons to ignore changes in the implicit dependencies. This
          causes cached implicit dependencies to always be used. This
          implies --implicit-cache.

   --install-sandbox=sandbox_path
          When using the Install builders, prepend sandbox_path to the
          installation paths such that all installed files will be placed
          under that directory. This option is unavailable if one of
          [65]Install, [66]InstallAs or [67]InstallVersionedLib is not
          used in the SConscript files.

   --interactive
          Starts SCons in interactive mode. The SConscript files are read
          once and a scons>>> prompt is printed. Targets may now be
          rebuilt by typing commands at interactive prompt without having
          to re-read the SConscript files and re-initialize the dependency
          graph from scratch.

          SCons interactive mode supports the following commands:

        build [OPTIONS] [TARGETS] ...
                Builds the specified TARGETS (and their dependencies) with
                the specified SCons command-line OPTIONS. b and scons are
                synonyms for build.

                The following SCons command-line options affect the build
                command:

--cache-debug=FILE
--cache-disable, --no-cache
--cache-force, --cache-populate
--cache-readonly
--cache-show
--debug=TYPE
-i, --ignore-errors
-j N, --jobs=N
-k, --keep-going
-n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
-Q
-s, --silent, --quiet
--taskmastertrace=FILE
--tree=OPTIONS

                Any other SCons command-line options that are specified do
                not cause errors but have no effect on the build command
                (mainly because they affect how the SConscript files are
                read, which only happens once at the beginning of
                interactive mode).

        clean [OPTIONS] [TARGETS] ...
                Cleans the specified TARGETS (and their dependencies) with
                the specified OPTIONS. c is a synonym. This command is
                itself a synonym for build --clean

        exit
                Exits SCons interactive mode. You can also exit by
                terminating input (Ctrl+D UNIX or Linux systems, (Ctrl+Z
                on Windows systems).

        help [COMMAND]
                Provides a help message about the commands available in
                SCons interactive mode. If COMMAND is specified, h and ?
                are synonyms.

        shell [COMMANDLINE]
                Executes the specified COMMANDLINE in a subshell. If no
                COMMANDLINE is specified, executes the interactive command
                interpreter specified in the SHELL environment variable
                (on UNIX and Linux systems) or the COMSPEC environment
                variable (on Windows systems). sh and ! are synonyms.

        version
                Prints SCons version information.

          An empty line repeats the last typed command. Command-line
          editing can be used if the readline module is available.

$ scons --interactive
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons>>> build -n prog
scons>>> exit

   -j N, --jobs=N
          Specifies the maximum number of concurrent jobs (commands) to
          run. If there is more than one -j option, the last one is
          effective.

   -k, --keep-going
          Continue as much as possible after an error. The target that
          failed and those that depend on it will not be remade, but other
          targets specified on the command line will still be processed.

   -m
          Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of Make.

   --max-drift=SECONDS
          Set the maximum expected drift in the modification time of files
          to SECONDS. This value determines how long a file must be
          unmodified before its cached content signature will be used
          instead of calculating a new content signature (hash) of the
          file's contents. The default value is 2 days, which means a file
          must have a modification time of at least two days ago in order
          to have its cached content signature used. A negative value
          means to never cache the content signature and to ignore the
          cached value if there already is one. A value of 0 means to
          always use the cached signature, no matter how old the file is.

   --md5-chunksize=KILOBYTES
          A deprecated synonym for [68]--hash-chunksize.

          Changed in version 4.2: deprecated.

   -n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
          Set no-exec mode. Print the commands that would be executed to
          build any out-of-date targets, but do not execute those
          commands.

          Only target building is suppressed - any work in the build
          system that is done directly (in regular Python code) will still
          be carried out. You can add guards around code which should not
          be executed in no-exec mode by checking the value of the option
          at run time with [69]GetOption:

if not GetOption("no_exec"):
    # run regular instructions

          The output is a best effort, as SCons cannot always precisely
          determine what would be built. For example, if a file generated
          by a builder action is also used as a source in the build, that
          file is not available to scan for dependencies at all in an
          unbuilt tree, and may contain out-of-date information in a
          previously built tree.

          SCons cannot perform [70]Configure checks in no-exec mode, as
          they would make changes to the filesystem (see [71]$CONFIGUREDIR
          and [72]$CONFIGURELOG). It can use stored information from a
          previous build, if it is not out-of-date, so a "priming" build
          may make subsequent no-exec runs more useful.

   --no-site-dir
          Do not read site directories. Neither the standard site
          directories (site_scons) nor the path specified via a previous
          --site-dir option are added to the module search path sys.path,
          searched for a site_init.py file, or have their site_tools
          directory included in the tool search path. Can be overridden by
          a subsequent --site-dir option.

   --package-type=type
          The type of package to create when using the [73]Package
          builder. Multiple types can be specified by using a
          comma-separated string, in which case SCons will try to build
          for all of those package types. Note this option is only
          available if the [74]packaging tool has been enabled.

   --profile=file
          Run SCons under the Python profiler and save the results to
          file. The results may be analyzed using the Python pstats
          module.

   -q, --question
          Do not run any commands, or print anything. Just return an exit
          status that is zero if the specified targets are already
          up-to-date, non-zero otherwise.

   -Q
          Suppress status messages about reading SConscript files,
          building targets and entering directories. Commands that are
          executed to rebuild target files are still printed.

   --random
          Build dependencies in a random order. This is useful when
          building multiple trees simultaneously with caching enabled, to
          prevent multiple builds from simultaneously trying to build or
          retrieve the same target files.

   -s, --silent, --quiet
          Silent. Do not print commands that are executed to rebuild
          target files. Also suppresses SCons status messages.

   -S, --no-keep-going, --stop
          Ignored for compatibility with GNU Make

   --site-dir=path
          Use path as the site directory rather than searching the list of
          default site directories. This directory will be prepended to
          sys.path, the module path/site_init.py will be loaded if it
          exists, and path/site_tools will be included in the tool search
          path. The option is not additive - if given more than once, the
          last path wins.

          The default set of site directories searched when --site-dir is
          not specified depends on the system platform, as follows. Users
          or system administrators can tune site-specific or
          project-specific SCons behavior by setting up a site directory
          in one or more of these locations. Directories are examined in
          the order given, from most generic ("system" directories) to
          most specific (in the current project), so the last-executed
          site_init.py file is the most specific one, giving it the chance
          to override everything else), and the directories are prepended
          to the paths, again so the last directory examined comes first
          in the resulting path.

        Windows:

./site_scons

                Note earlier versions of the documentation listed a
                different path for the "system" site directory, this path
                is still checked but its use is discouraged:

   --stack-size=KILOBYTES
          Set the size stack used to run threads to KILOBYTES. This value
          determines the stack size of the threads used to run jobs. These
          threads execute the actions of the builders for the nodes that
          are out-of-date. This option has no effect unless the number of
          concurrent build jobs is larger than one (as set by -j N or
          --jobs=N on the command line or SetOption in a script).

          Using a stack size that is too small may cause stack overflow
          errors. This usually shows up as segmentation faults that cause
          scons to abort before building anything. Using a stack size that
          is too large will cause scons to use more memory than required
          and may slow down the entire build process. The default value is
          to use a stack size of 256 kilobytes, which should be
          appropriate for most uses. You should not need to increase this
          value unless you encounter stack overflow errors.

   -t, --touch
          Ignored for compatibility with GNU Make. (Touching a file to
          make it appear up-to-date is unnecessary when using scons.)

   --taskmastertrace=file
          Prints trace information to the specified file about how the
          internal Taskmaster object evaluates and controls the order in
          which Nodes are built. A file name of - may be used to specify
          the standard output.

   --tree=type[,type...]
          Prints a tree of the dependencies after each top-level target is
          built. This prints out some or all of the tree, in various
          formats, depending on the type specified:

        all
                Print the entire dependency tree after each top-level
                target is built. This prints out the complete dependency
                tree, including implicit dependencies and ignored
                dependencies.

        derived
                Restricts the tree output to only derived (target) files,
                not source files.

        linedraw
                Draw the tree output using Unicode line-drawing characters
                instead of plain ASCII text. This option acts as a
                modifier to the selected type(s). If specified alone,
                without any type, it behaves as if all had been specified.

                New in version 4.0.

        status
                Prints status information for each displayed node.

        prune
                Prunes the tree to avoid repeating dependency information
                for nodes that have already been displayed. Any node that
                has already been displayed will have its name printed in
                [square brackets], as an indication that the dependencies
                for that node can be found by searching for the relevant
                output higher up in the tree.

          Multiple type choices may be specified, separated by commas:

# Prints only derived files, with status information:
scons --tree=derived,status

# Prints all dependencies of target, with status information
# and pruning dependencies of already-visited Nodes:
scons --tree=all,prune,status target

   -u, --up, --search-up
          Walks up the directory structure until an SConstruct,
          Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py, Sconstruct.py or
          sconstruct.py file is found, and uses that as the project top
          directory. If no targets are specified on the command line, only
          targets at or below the current directory will be built.

   -U
          Works exactly the same way as the -u option except for the way
          default targets are handled. When this option is used and no
          targets are specified on the command line, all default targets
          that are defined in the SConscript file(s) in the current
          directory are built, regardless of what directory the resultant
          targets end up in.

   -v, --version
          Print the scons version, copyright information, list of authors,
          and any other relevant information. Then exit.

   -w, --print-directory
          Print a message containing the working directory before and
          after other processing.

   --no-print-directory
          Turn off -w, even if it was turned on implicitly.

   --warn=type, --warn=no-type
          Enable or disable (with the prefix "no-") warnings (--warning is
          a synonym). type specifies the type of warnings to be enabled or
          disabled:

        all
                All warnings.

        cache-version
                Warnings about the derived-file cache directory specified
                by [75]CacheDir not using the latest configuration
                information. These warnings are enabled by default.

        cache-write-error
                Warnings about errors trying to write a copy of a built
                file to a specified derived-file cache specified by
                [76]CacheDir. These warnings are disabled by default.

        cache-cleanup-error
                Warnings about errors when a file retrieved from the
                derived-file cache could not be removed.

        corrupt-sconsign
                Warnings about unfamiliar signature data in .sconsign
                files. These warnings are enabled by default.

        dependency
                Warnings about dependencies. These warnings are disabled
                by default.

        deprecated
                Warnings about use of currently deprecated features. These
                warnings are enabled by default. Not all deprecation
                warnings can be disabled with the --warn=no-deprecated
                option as some deprecated features which are late in the
                deprecation cycle may have been designated as mandatory
                warnings, and these will still display. Warnings for
                certain deprecated features may also be enabled or
                disabled individually; see below.

        duplicate-environment
                Warnings about attempts to specify a build of a target
                with two different construction environments that use the
                same action. These warnings are enabled by default.

        fortran-cxx-mix
                Warnings about linking Fortran and C++ object files in a
                single executable, which can yield unpredictable behavior
                with some compilers.

        future-reserved-variable
                Warnings about construction variables which are currently
                allowed, but will become reserved variables in a future
                release.

        future-deprecated
                Warnings about features that will be deprecated in the
                future. Such warnings are disabled by default. Enabling
                future deprecation warnings is recommended for projects
                that redistribute SCons configurations for other users to
                build, so that the project can be warned as soon as
                possible about to-be-deprecated features that may require
                changes to the configuration.

        link
                Warnings about link steps.

        misleading-keywords
                Warnings about the use of two commonly misspelled keywords
                targets and sources to [77]Builder calls. The correct
                spelling is the singular form, even though target and
                source can themselves refer to lists of names or nodes.

        tool-qt-deprecated
                Warnings about the [78]qt tool being deprecated. These
                warnings are disabled by default for the first phase of
                deprecation. Enable to be reminded about use of this tool
                module. New in version 4.3.

        no-object-count
                Warnings about the --debug=object feature not working when
                scons is run with the Python -O option or from optimized
                Python (.pyo) modules.

                Note the "no-" prefix is part of the name of this warning.
                Add another "-no" to disable.

        no-parallel-support
                Warnings about the version of Python not being able to
                support parallel builds when the [79]-j option is used.
                These warnings are enabled by default.

                Note the "no-" prefix is part of the name of this warning.
                Add another "-no" to disable.

        python-version
                Warnings about running SCons using a version of Python
                that has been deprecated. These warnings are enabled by
                default.

        reserved-variable
                Warnings about attempts to set the reserved construction
                variable names $CHANGED_SOURCES, $CHANGED_TARGETS,
                $TARGET, $TARGETS, $SOURCE, $SOURCES, $UNCHANGED_SOURCES
                or $UNCHANGED_TARGETS. These warnings are disabled by
                default.

        stack-size
                Warnings about requests to set the stack size that could
                not be honored. These warnings are enabled by default.

        target-not-built
                Warnings about a build rule not building the expected
                targets. These warnings are disabled by default.

   -Y repository, --repository=repository, --srcdir=repository
          Search repository for any input and target files not found in
          the local directory hierarchy. Multiple -Y options may be
          specified, with repositories searched in the given order. See
          [80]Repository for more information.

SCONSCRIPT FILE REFERENCE

SConscript Files

   The build configuration is described by one or more files, known as
   SConscript files. There must be at least one file for a valid build
   (scons will quit if it does not find one). scons by default looks for
   this file by the name SConstruct in the directory from which you run
   scons, though if necessary, also looks for alternative file names
   Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py, Sconstruct.py and sconstruct.py
   in that order. A different file name (which can include a pathname
   part) may be specified via the -f option. Except for the SConstruct
   file, these files are not searched for automatically; you add
   additional configuration files to the build by calling the
   [81]SConscript function. This allows parts of the build to be
   conditionally included or excluded at run-time depending on how scons
   is invoked.

   Each SConscript file in a build configuration is invoked independently
   in a separate context. This provides necessary isolation so that
   different parts of the build don't accidentally step on each other. You
   have to be explicit about sharing information, by using the [82]Export
   function or the exports argument to the [83]SConscript function, as
   well as the [84]Return function in a called SConscript file, and
   consume shared information by using the [85]Import function.

   The following sections describe the various SCons facilities that can
   be used in SConscript files. Quick links:
   [86]Construction Environments
   [87]Tools
   [88]Builder Methods
   [89]Functions and Environment Methods
   [90]SConscript Variables
   [91]Construction Variables
   [92]Configure Contexts
   [93]Command-Line Construction Variables
   [94]Node Objects

Construction Environments

   A Construction Environment is the basic means by which you communicate
   build information to SCons. A new construction environment is created
   using the [95]Environment function:
env = Environment()

   Construction environment attributes called Construction Variables may
   be set either by specifying them as keyword arguments when the object
   is created or by assigning them a value after the object is created.
   These two are nominally equivalent:
env = Environment(FOO='foo')
env['FOO'] = 'foo'

   Note that certain settings which affect tool detection are referenced
   only when the tools are initialized, so you need either to supply them
   as part of the call to [96]Environment, or defer tool initialization.
   For example, initializing the Microsoft Visual C++ version you wish to
   use:
# initializes msvc to v14.1
env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION="14.1")

env = Environment()
# msvc tool was initialized to default, does not reinitialize
env['MSVC_VERSION'] = "14.1"

env = Environment(tools=[])
env['MSVC_VERSION'] = "14.1"
# msvc tool initialization was deferred, so will pick up new value
env.Tool('default')

   As a convenience, construction variables may also be set or modified by
   the parse_flags keyword argument during object creation, which has the
   effect of the [97]env.MergeFlags method being applied to the argument
   value after all other processing is completed. This is useful either if
   the exact content of the flags is unknown (for example, read from a
   control file) or if the flags need to be distributed to a number of
   construction variables. [98]env.ParseFlags describes how these
   arguments are distributed to construction variables.
env = Environment(parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

   This example adds 'include' to the [99]$CPPPATH construction variable,
   'EBUG' to [100]$CPPDEFINES, and 'm' to [101]$LIBS.

   An existing construction environment can be duplicated by calling the
   [102]env.Clone method. Without arguments, it will be a copy with the
   same settings. Otherwise, env.Clone takes the same arguments as
   [103]Environment, and uses the arguments to create a modified copy.

   SCons provides a special construction environment called the Default
   Environment. The default environment is used only for global functions,
   that is, build requests called without the context of a regular
   construction environment. See [104]DefaultEnvironment for more
   information.

   By default, a new construction environment is initialized with a set of
   builder methods and construction variables that are appropriate for the
   current platform. The optional platform keyword argument may be used to
   specify that the construction environment should be initialized for a
   different platform:
env = Environment(platform='cygwin')

   Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate construction
   variables in the environment to use and generate file names with
   prefixes and suffixes appropriate for that platform.

   Note that the win32 platform adds the SystemDrive and SystemRoot
   variables from the user's external environment to the construction
   environment's ENV dictionary. This is so that any executed commands
   that use sockets to connect with other systems will work on Windows
   systems.

   The platform argument may be a string value representing one of the
   pre-defined platforms (aix, cygwin, darwin, hpux, irix, os2, posix,
   sunos or win32), or a callable platform object returned by a call to
   [105]Platform selecting a pre-defined platform, or it may be a
   user-supplied callable, in which case the Environment method will call
   it to update the new construction environment:
def my_platform(env):
    env['VAR'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(platform=my_platform)

   Note that supplying a non-default platform or custom function for
   initialization may bypass settings that should happen for the host
   system and should be used with care. It is most useful in the case
   where the platform is an alternative for the one that would be
   auto-detected, such as platform="cygwin" on a system which would
   otherwise identify as win32.

   The optional tools and toolpath keyword arguments affect the way tools
   available to the environment are initialized. See [106]the section
   called "Tools" for details.

   The optional variables keyword argument allows passing a Variables
   object which will be used in the initialization of the construction
   environment See [107]the section called "Command-Line Construction
   Variables" for details.

Tools

   SCons has many included tool modules (more properly, tool specification
   modules) which are used to help initialize the construction environment
   prior to building, and more can be written to suit a particular
   purpose, or added from external sources (a repository of contributed
   tools is available). More information on writing custom tools can be
   found in the [108]Extending SCons section and specifically [109]Tool
   Modules.

   An SCons tool is only responsible for setup. For example, if an
   SConscript file declares the need to construct an object file from a
   C-language source file by calling the [110]Object builder, then a tool
   module representing an available C compiler needs to have run first, to
   set up that builder and all the construction variables it needs in the
   associated construction environment. The tool itself is not called in
   the process of the build. Tool setup happens when a construction
   environment is constructed, and in the basic case needs no intervention
   - platform-specific lists of default tools are used to examine the
   specific capabilities of that platform and configure the environment,
   skipping those tools which are not applicable.

   If necessary, a specific set of tools to initialize in an environment
   during creation may be specified using the optional keyword argument
   tools. tools must be a list, even if there are one (or zero) tools.
   This is useful to override the defaults, to specify non-default
   built-in tools, and to cause added tools to be called:
env = Environment(tools=['msvc', 'lex'])

   The tools argument overrides the default tool list, it does not add to
   it, so be sure to include all the tools you need. For example, if you
   are building a c/c++ program, you must specify a tool for at least a
   compiler and a linker, as in tools=['clang', 'link'].

   If the tools argument is omitted, or if tools includes the reserved
   name 'default', then SCons will auto-detect usable tools, using the
   search path from the execution environment (that is,
   env['ENV']['PATH']) for looking up any external programs, and the
   platform name in effect to determine the default tools for that
   platform. Note the contents of PATH from the external environment
   os.environ is not used. Changing the PATH in the execution environment
   after the construction environment is constructed will not cause the
   tools to be re-detected.

   Tools can also be directly called by using the [111]Tool method (see
   below).

   default
          Sets construction variables for a default list of Tool modules.
          Use default in the tools list to retain the original defaults,
          since the tools parameter is treated as a literal statement of
          the tools to be made available in that construction environment,
          not an addition.

          The list of tools selected by default is not static, but is
          dependent both on the platform and on the software installed on
          the platform. Some tools will not initialize if an underlying
          command is not found, and some tools are selected from a list of
          choices on a first-found basis. The finished tool list can be
          examined by inspecting the [259]$TOOLS construction variable in
          the construction environment.

          On all platforms, the tools from the following list are selected
          if their respective conditions are met: filesystem;, wix,
          [260]lex, [261]yacc, [262]rpcgen, [263]swig, [264]jar,
          [265]javac, [266]javah, [267]rmic, [268]dvipdf, [269]dvips,
          [270]gs, [271]tex, [272]latex, [273]pdflatex, [274]pdftex,
          [275]tar, [276]zip, [277]textfile.

          On Linux systems, the default tools list selects (first-found):
          a C compiler from [278]gcc, [279]intelc, [280]icc, [281]cc; a
          C++ compiler from [282]g++, [283]intelc, [284]icc, [285]cXX; an
          assembler from [286]gas, [287]nasm, [288]masm; a linker from
          [289]gnulink, [290]ilink; a Fortran compiler from [291]gfortran,
          [292]g77, [293]ifort, [294]ifl, [295]f95, [296]f90, [297]f77;
          and a static archiver [298]ar. It also selects all found from
          the list [299]m4 rpm.

          On Windows systems, the default tools list selects
          (first-found): a C compiler from [300]msvc, [301]mingw,
          [302]gcc, [303]intelc, [304]icl, [305]icc, [306]cc, [307]bcc32;
          a C++ compiler from [308]msvc, [309]intelc, [310]icc, [311]g++,
          [312]cXX, [313]bcc32; an assembler from [314]masm, [315]nasm,
          [316]gas, [317]386asm; a linker from [318]mslink, [319]gnulink,
          [320]ilink, [321]linkloc, [322]ilink32; a Fortran compiler from
          [323]gfortran, [324]g77, [325]ifl, [326]cvf, [327]f95, [328]f90,
          [329]fortran; and a static archiver from [330]mslib, [331]ar,
          [332]tlib; It also selects all found from the list [333]msvs,
          [334]midl.

          On MacOS systems, the default tools list selects (first-found):
          a C compiler from [335]gcc, [336]cc; a C++ compiler from
          [337]g++, [338]cXX; an assembler [339]as; a linker from
          [340]applelink, [341]gnulink; a Fortran compiler from
          [342]gfortran, [343]f95, [344]f90, [345]g77; and a static
          archiver [346]ar. It also selects all found from the list
          [347]m4, rpm.

          Default lists for other platforms can be found by examining the
          scons source code (see SCons/Tool/__init__.py).

   dmd
          Sets construction variables for D language compiler DMD.

   docbook
          This tool tries to make working with Docbook in SCons a little
          easier. It provides several toolchains for creating different
          output formats, like HTML or PDF. Contained in the package is a
          distribution of the Docbook XSL stylesheets as of version
          1.76.1. As long as you don't specify your own stylesheets for
          customization, these official versions are picked as
          default...which should reduce the inevitable setup hassles for
          you.

          Implicit dependencies to images and XIncludes are detected
          automatically if you meet the HTML requirements. The additional
          stylesheet utils/xmldepend.xsl by Paul DuBois is used for this
          purpose.

          Note, that there is no support for XML catalog resolving
          offered! This tool calls the XSLT processors and PDF renderers
          with the stylesheets you specified, that's it. The rest lies in
          your hands and you still have to know what you're doing when
          resolving names via a catalog.

          For activating the tool "docbook", you have to add its name to
          the Environment constructor, like this

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])

          On its startup, the docbook tool tries to find a required
          xsltproc processor, and a PDF renderer, e.g. fop. So make sure
          that these are added to your system's environment PATH and can
          be called directly without specifying their full path.

          For the most basic processing of Docbook to HTML, you need to
          have installed

          + the Python lxml binding to libxml2, or
          + a standalone XSLT processor, currently detected are xsltproc,
            saxon, saxon-xslt and xalan.

          Rendering to PDF requires you to have one of the applications
          fop or xep installed.

          Creating a HTML or PDF document is very simple and
          straightforward. Say

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')
env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          to get both outputs from your XML source manual.xml. As a
          shortcut, you can give the stem of the filenames alone, like
          this:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual')
env.DocbookPdf('manual')

          and get the same result. Target and source lists are also
          supported:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml(['manual.html','reference.html'], ['manual.xml','reference.xml']
)

          or even

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml(['manual','reference'])

Important

          Whenever you leave out the list of sources, you may not specify
          a file extension! The Tool uses the given names as file stems,
          and adds the suffixes for target and source files accordingly.

          The rules given above are valid for the Builders
          [384]DocbookHtml, [385]DocbookPdf, [386]DocbookEpub,
          [387]DocbookSlidesPdf and [388]DocbookXInclude. For the
          [389]DocbookMan transformation you can specify a target name,
          but the actual output names are automatically set from the
          refname entries in your XML source.

          The Builders [390]DocbookHtmlChunked, [391]DocbookHtmlhelp and
          [392]DocbookSlidesHtml are special, in that:

         1. they create a large set of files, where the exact names and
            their number depend on the content of the source file, and
         2. the main target is always named index.html, i.e. the output
            name for the XSL transformation is not picked up by the
            stylesheets.

          As a result, there is simply no use in specifying a target HTML
          name. So the basic syntax for these builders is always:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

          If you want to use a specific XSL file, you can set the
          additional xsl parameter to your Builder call as follows:

env.DocbookHtml('other.html', 'manual.xml', xsl='html.xsl')

          Since this may get tedious if you always use the same local
          naming for your customized XSL files, e.g. html.xsl for HTML and
          pdf.xsl for PDF output, a set of variables for setting the
          default XSL name is provided. These are:

DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLCHUNKED
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLHELP
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_EPUB
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_MAN
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESPDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESHTML

          and you can set them when constructing your environment:

env = Environment(
    tools=['docbook'],
    DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML='html.xsl',
    DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF='pdf.xsl',
)
env.DocbookHtml('manual')  # now uses html.xsl

   gettext
          A toolset supporting internationalization and localization of
          software being constructed with SCons. The toolset loads the
          following tools:

          + [588]xgettext - extract internationalized messages from source
            code to POT file(s).
          + [589]msginit - initialize PO files during initial translation
            of a project.
          + [590]msgmerge - update PO files that already contain
            translated messages,
          + [591]msgfmt - compile textual PO files to binary installable
            MO files.

          When you enable gettext, it internally loads all the
          above-mentioned tools, so you're encouraged to see their
          individual documentation.

          Each of the above tools provides its own builder(s) which may be
          used to perform particular activities related to software
          internationalization. You may be however interested in top-level
          [592]Translate builder.

          To use the gettext tools, add the 'gettext' tool to your
          construction environment:

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'gettext'])

   qt
          Placeholder tool to alert anyone still using qt tools to switch
          to qt3 or newer tool.

   qt3
          Sets construction variables for building Qt3 applications.

Note

          This tool is only suitable for building targeted to Qt3, which
          is obsolete (the tool is deprecated since 4.3, and was renamed
          to qt3 in 4.5.0. ). There are contributed tools for Qt4 and Qt5,
          see [1063]https://github.com/SCons/scons-contrib. Qt4 has also
          passed end of life for standard support (in Dec 2015).

          Note paths for these construction variables are assembled using
          the os.path.join method so they will have the appropriate
          separator at runtime, but are listed here in the various entries
          only with the '/' separator for simplicity.

          In addition, the construction variables [1064]$CPPPATH,
          [1065]$LIBPATH and [1066]$LIBS may be modified and the variables
          [1067]$PROGEMITTER, [1068]$SHLIBEMITTER and [1069]$LIBEMITTER
          are modified. Because the build-performance is affected when
          using this tool, you have to explicitly specify it at
          Environment creation:

Environment(tools=['default','qt3'])

          The qt3 tool supports the following operations:

          Automatic moc file generation from header files. You do not have
          to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you.
          However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header
          file must have the same basename as your implementation file and
          must stay in the same directory. It must have one of the
          suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You can turn off automatic moc
          file generation by setting [1070]$QT3_AUTOSCAN to False. See
          also the corresponding [1071]Moc Builder.

          Automatic moc file generation from C++ files. As described in
          the Qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of the C++
          file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated
          by the transformation
          ${QT3_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT3_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
          <basename>.mo. A warning is generated after building the moc
          file if you do not include the correct file. If you are using
          [1072]VariantDir, you may need to specify duplicate=True. You
          can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting
          $QT3_AUTOSCAN to False. See also the corresponding [1073]Moc
          Builder.

          Automatic handling of .ui files. The implementation files
          generated from .ui files are handled much the same as yacc or
          lex files. Each .ui file given as a source of [1074]Program,
          [1075]Library or [1076]SharedLibrary will generate three files:
          the declaration file, the implementation file and a moc file.
          Because there are also generated headers, you may need to
          specify duplicate=True in calls to [1077]VariantDir. See also
          the corresponding [1078]Uic Builder.

Builder Methods

   You tell SCons what to build by calling Builders, functions which take
   particular action(s) to produce target(s) of a particular type
   (conventionally hinted at by the builder name, e.g. Program) from the
   specified source files. A builder call is a declaration: SCons enters
   the specified relationship into its internal dependency node graph, and
   only later makes the decision on whether anything is actually built,
   since this depends on command-line options, target selection rules, and
   whether the target(s) are out-of-date with respect to the sources.

   SCons provides a number of builders, and you can also write your own
   (see [1252]Builder Objects). Builders are created dynamically at
   run-time, often (though not always) by tools which determine whether
   the external dependencies for the builder are satisfied, and which
   perform the necessary setup (see [1253]Tools). Builders are attached to
   a construction environment as methods. The available builder methods
   are registered as key-value pairs in the [1254]$BUILDERS attribute of
   the construction environment, so the available builders can be
   examined. This example displays them for debugging purposes:
env = Environment()
print("Builders:", list(env['BUILDERS']))

   Builder methods take two required arguments: target and source. The
   target and source arguments can be specified either as positional
   arguments, in which case target comes first, or as keyword arguments,
   using target= and source=. Although both arguments are nominally
   required, if there is a single source and the target can be inferred
   the target argument can be omitted (see below). Builder methods also
   take a variety of keyword arguments, described below.

   Because long lists of file names can lead to a lot of quoting in a
   builder call, SCons supplies a [1255]Split global function and a
   same-named environment method that splits a single string into a list,
   using strings of white-space characters as the delimiter (similar to
   the Python string split method, but succeeds even if the input isn't a
   string).

   The following are equivalent examples of calling the Program builder
   method:
env.Program('bar', ['bar.c', 'foo.c'])
env.Program('bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(source=['bar.c', 'foo.c'], target='bar')
env.Program(target='bar', source=Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(target='bar', source=env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', source='bar.c foo.c'.split())

   Sources and targets can be specified as a scalar or as a list, composed
   of either strings or nodes (more on nodes below). When specifying path
   strings, Python follows the POSIX pathname convention: if a string
   begins with the operating system pathname separator (on Windows both
   the slash and backslash separator are accepted, and any leading drive
   specifier is ignored for the determination) it is considered an
   absolute path, otherwise it is a relative path. If the path string
   contains no separator characters, it is searched for as a file in the
   current directory. If it contains separator characters, the search
   follows down from the starting point, which is the top of the directory
   tree for an absolute path and the current directory for a relative
   path. The "current directory" in this context is the directory of the
   SConscript file currently being processed.

   SCons also recognizes a third way to specify path strings: if the
   string begins with the # character it is top-relative - it works like a
   relative path, but the search follows down from the project top
   directory rather than from the current directory. The # can optionally
   be followed by a pathname separator, which is ignored if found in that
   position. Top-relative paths only work in places where scons will
   interpret the path (see some examples below). To be used in other
   contexts the string will need to be converted to a relative or absolute
   path first.

   Examples:
# The comments describing the targets that will be built
# assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the
# a subdirectory named "subdir".

# Builds the program "subdir/foo" from "subdir/foo.c":
env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

# Builds the program "/tmp/bar" from "subdir/bar.c":
env.Program('/tmp/bar', 'bar.c')

# An initial '#' or '#/' are equivalent; the following
# calls build the programs "foo" and "bar" (in the
# top-level SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c" and
# "subdir/bar.c", respectively:
env.Program('#foo', 'foo.c')
env.Program('#/bar', 'bar.c')

# Builds the program "other/foo" (relative to the top-level
# SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c":
env.Program('#other/foo', 'foo.c')

# This will not work, only SCons interfaces understand '#',
# os.path.exists is pure Python:
if os.path.exists('#inc/foo.h'):
    env.Append(CPPPATH='#inc')

   When the target shares the same base name as the source and only the
   suffix varies, and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the
   target file type, then the target argument may be omitted completely,
   and scons will deduce the target file name from the source file name.
   The following examples all build the executable program bar (on POSIX
   systems) or bar.exe (on Windows systems) from the bar.c source file:
env.Program(target='bar', source='bar.c')
env.Program('bar', source='bar.c')
env.Program(source='bar.c')
env.Program('bar.c')

   The optional srcdir keyword argument specifies that all source file
   strings that are not absolute paths or top-relative paths shall be
   interpreted relative to the specified srcdir. The following example
   will build the build/prog (or build/prog.exe on Windows) program from
   the files src/f1.c and src/f2.c:
env.Program('build/prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c'], srcdir='src')

   The optional parse_flags keyword argument causes behavior similar to
   the [1256]env.MergeFlags method, where the argument value is broken
   into individual settings and merged into the appropriate construction
   variables.
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

   This example adds 'include' to the [1257]$CPPPATH construction
   variable, 'EBUG' to [1258]$CPPDEFINES, and 'm' to [1259]$LIBS.

   The optional chdir keyword argument specifies that the Builder's
   action(s) should be executed after changing directory. If the chdir
   argument is a path string or a directory Node, scons will change to the
   specified directory. If the chdir is not a string or Node and evaluates
   true, then scons will change to the target file's directory. The
   original directory is restored after the action is complete.
# scons will change to the "sub" subdirectory
# before executing the "cp" command.
env.Command(
    target='sub/dir/foo.out',
    source='sub/dir/foo.in',
    action="cp dir/foo.in dir/foo.out",
    chdir='sub',
)

# Because chdir is not a string, scons will change to the
# target's directory ("sub/dir") before executing the
# "cp" command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in', "cp foo.in foo.out", chdir=True
)

Warning

   Python only tracks one current directory location, even if there are
   multiple executing threads. This means that use of the chdir argument
   will not work with SCons in multi-threaded mode (the [1260]-j option),
   because individual worker threads spawned by SCons interfere with each
   other when they start changing directory.

   Note that SCons will not automatically modify its expansion of
   construction variables like [1261]$TARGET and [1262]$SOURCE when using
   the chdir keyword argument--that is, the expanded file names will still
   be relative to the project top directory, and consequently incorrect
   relative to the chdir directory. If you use the chdir keyword argument,
   you will typically need to supply a different command line using
   expansions like ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to use just the
   filename portion of the target and source.

   Keyword arguments that are not specifically recognized are treated as
   construction variable overrides, which replace or add those variables
   on a limited basis. These overrides will only be in effect when
   building the target of the builder call, and will not affect other
   parts of the build. For example, if you want to specify some libraries
   needed by just one program:
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])

   or generate a shared library with a non-standard suffix:
env.SharedLibrary(
    target='word',
    source='word.cpp',
    SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx',
    LIBSUFFIXES=['.ocx'],
)

   Note that both the [1263]$SHLIBSUFFIX and [1264]$LIBSUFFIXES
   construction variables must be set if you want scons to search
   automatically for dependencies on the non-standard library names; see
   the descriptions of these variables for more information.

   Although the builder methods defined by scons are, in fact, methods of
   a construction environment object, many may also be called without an
   explicit environment:
Program('hello', 'hello.c')
SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp')

   If called this way, the builder will internally use the Default
   Environment that consists of the tools and values that scons has
   determined are appropriate for the local system.

   Builder methods that can be called without an explicit environment
   (indicated in the listing of builders below without a leading env.) may
   be called from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript
   file by adding the following to the Python module:
from SCons.Script import *

   A builder may add additional targets beyond those requested if an
   attached Emitter chooses to do so (see [1265]the section called
   "Builder Objects" for more information. [1266]$PROGEMITTER is an
   example). For example, the GNU linker takes a command-line argument
   -Map=mapfile, which causes it to produce a linker map file in addition
   to the executable file actually being linked. If the [1267]Program
   builder's emitter is configured to add this mapfile if the option is
   set, then two targets will be returned when you only provided for one.

   For this reason, builder methods always return a NodeList, a list-like
   object whose elements are Nodes. Nodes are the internal representation
   of build targets or sources (see [1268]the section called "Node
   Objects" for more information). The returned NodeList object can be
   passed to other builder methods as source(s) or to other SCons
   functions or methods where a path string would normally be accepted.

   For example, to add a specific preprocessor define when compiling one
   specific object file but not the others:
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
env.Program("prog", ['foo.c', bar_obj_list, 'main.c'])

   Using a Node as in this example makes for a more portable build by
   avoiding having to specify a platform-specific object suffix when
   calling the [1269]Program builder method.

   The NodeList object is also convenient to pass to the [1270]Default
   function, for the same reason of avoiding a platform-specific name:
tgt = env.Program("prog", ["foo.c", "bar.c", "main.c"])
Default(tgt)

   The Node representing the explicitly-requested target is always the
   first element of the returned NodeList, and can be retrieved via list
   indexing (e.g. bar_obj_list[0]). The path name for a Node's file can be
   obtained by using Python's string constructor str (e.g.
   str(bar_obj_list[0])).

   Builder calls will automatically "flatten" lists passed as source and
   target, so they are free to contain elements which are themselves
   lists, such as bar_obj_list returned by the [1271]StaticObject call. If
   you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by builders directly in
   Python code, you can either build a new list by hand:
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = ['begin.o'] + foo + ['middle.o'] + bar + ['end.o']
for obj in objects:
    print(str(obj))

   Or you can use the [1272]Flatten function supplied by SCons to create a
   list containing just the Nodes, which may be more convenient:
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = Flatten(['begin.o', foo, 'middle.o', bar, 'end.o'])
for obj in objects:
    print(str(obj))

   Since builder calls return a list-like object, not an actual Python
   list, it is not appropriate to use the Python add operator (+ or +=) to
   append builder results to a Python list. Because the list and the
   object are different types, Python will not update the original list in
   place, but will instead create a new NodeList object containing the
   concatenation of the list elements and the builder results. This will
   cause problems for any other Python variables in your SCons
   configuration that still hold on to a reference to the original list.
   Instead, use the Python list extend method to make sure the list is
   updated in-place. Example:
object_files = []

# Do NOT use += here:
#    object_files += Object('bar.c')
#
# It will not update the object_files list in place.
#
# Instead, use the list extend method:
object_files.extend(Object('bar.c'))

bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
print("The path to bar_obj is:", str(bar_obj_list[0]))

   All targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources.
   An explicit dependency can be specified using the [1273]env.Depends
   method of a construction environment (see below).

   In addition, scons automatically scans source files for various
   programming languages, so the dependencies do not need to be specified
   explicitly. By default, SCons can C source files, C++ source files,
   Fortran source files with .F (POSIX systems only), .fpp, or .FPP file
   extensions, and assembly language files with .S (POSIX systems only),
   .spp, or .SPP files extensions for C preprocessor dependencies. SCons
   also has default support for scanning D source files, You can also
   write your own Scanners to add support for additional source file
   types. These can be added to the default Scanner object used by the
   [1274]Object, [1275]StaticObject and [1276]SharedObject Builders by
   adding them to the SourceFileScanner object. See [1277]the section
   called "Scanner Objects" for more information about defining your own
   Scanner objects and using the SourceFileScanner object.

   The following builder methods are predefined in the SCons core software
   distribution. Depending on the setup of a particular construction
   environment and on the type and software installation status of the
   underlying system, not all builders may be available in that
   construction environment. Since the function calling signature is the
   same for all builders:
Buildername(target, source, [key=val, ...])

   it is omitted in this listing for brevity.

   CFile()
          env.CFile()
          Builds a C source file given a lex (.l) or yacc (.y) input file.
          The suffix specified by the [1278]$CFILESUFFIX construction
          variable (.c by default) is automatically added to the target if
          it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.c
env.CFile(target='foo.c', source='foo.l')

# builds bar.c
env.CFile(target='bar', source='bar.y')

   Command()
          env.Command()
          There is actually no Builder named Command, rather the term
          "Command Builder" refers to a function which, on each call,
          creates and calls an anonymous Builder. This is useful for
          "one-off" builds where a full Builder is not needed. Since the
          anonymous Builder is never hooked into the standard Builder
          framework, an Action must always be specified. See the
          [1279]Command function description for the calling syntax and
          details.

   CompilationDatabase()
          env.CompilationDatabase()
          CompilationDatabase is a special builder which adds a target to
          create a JSON formatted compilation database compatible with
          clang tooling (see the [1280]LLVM specification). This database
          is suitable for consumption by various tools and editors who can
          use it to obtain build and dependency information which
          otherwise would be internal to SCons. The builder does not
          require any source files to be specified, rather it arranges to
          emit information about all of the C, C++ and assembler
          source/output pairs identified in the build that are not
          excluded by the optional filter
          [1281]$COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER. The target is subject to the
          usual SCons target selection rules.

          If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a
          target name of compile_commands.json.

          If called with a single positional argument, scons will "deduce"
          the target name from that source argument, giving it the same
          name, and then ignore the source. This is the usual way to call
          the builder if a non-default target name is wanted.

          If called with either the target= or source= keyword arguments,
          the value of the argument is taken as the target name. If called
          with both, the target= value is used and source= is ignored. If
          called with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored,
          since there is no way to deduce what the intent was; in this
          case the default target name will be used.

Note

          You must load the compilation_db tool prior to specifying any
          part of your build or some source/output files will not show up
          in the compilation database.

          Available since scons 4.0.

   CXXFile()
          env.CXXFile()
          Builds a C++ source file given a lex (.ll) or yacc (.yy) input
          file. The suffix specified by the [1282]$CXXFILESUFFIX
          construction variable (.cc by default) is automatically added to
          the target if it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.cc
env.CXXFile(target='foo.cc', source='foo.ll')

# builds bar.cc
env.CXXFile(target='bar', source='bar.yy')

   DocbookEpub()
          env.DocbookEpub()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for EPUB output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookEpub('manual.epub', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookEpub('manual')

   DocbookHtml()
          env.DocbookHtml()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual')

   DocbookHtmlChunked()
          env.DocbookHtmlChunked()
          A pseudo-Builder providing a Docbook toolchain for chunked HTML
          output. It supports the base.dir parameter. The chunkfast.xsl
          file (requires "EXSLT") is used as the default stylesheet. Basic
          syntax:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file.

          If you use the root.filename parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to specify the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You
          can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given
          prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookHtmlhelp()
          env.DocbookHtmlhelp()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTMLHELP
          output. Its basic syntax is:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file.

          If you use the root.filename parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to specify the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You
          can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given
          prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookMan()
          env.DocbookMan()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for Man page
          output. Its basic syntax is:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookMan('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file. Note, that you can specify a
          target name, but the actual output names are automatically set
          from the refname entries in your XML source.

   DocbookPdf()
          env.DocbookPdf()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookPdf('manual')

   DocbookSlidesHtml()
          env.DocbookSlidesHtml()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML slides
          output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual')

          If you use the titlefoil.html parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to give the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('mymanual.html','manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You
          can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given
          prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookSlidesPdf()
          env.DocbookSlidesPdf()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF slides
          output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual')

   DocbookXInclude()
          env.DocbookXInclude()
          A pseudo-Builder, for resolving XIncludes in a separate
          processing step.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookXInclude('manual_xincluded.xml', 'manual.xml')

   DocbookXslt()
          env.DocbookXslt()
          A pseudo-Builder, applying a given XSL transformation to the
          input file.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookXslt('manual_transformed.xml', 'manual.xml', xsl='transform.xslt')

          Note, that this builder requires the xsl parameter to be set.

   DVI()
          env.DVI()
          Builds a .dvi file from a .tex, .ltx or .latex input file. If
          the source file suffix is .tex, scons will examine the contents
          of the file; if the string \documentclass or \documentstyle is
          found, the file is assumed to be a LaTeX file and the target is
          built by invoking the [1283]$LATEXCOM command line; otherwise,
          the [1284]$TEXCOM command line is used. If the file is a LaTeX
          file, the DVI builder method will also examine the contents of
          the .aux file and invoke the [1285]$BIBTEX command line if the
          string bibdata is found, start [1286]$MAKEINDEX to generate an
          index if a .ind file is found and will examine the contents .log
          file and re-run the [1287]$LATEXCOM command if the log file says
          it is necessary.

          The suffix .dvi (hard-coded within TeX itself) is automatically
          added to the target if it is not already present. Examples:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.DVI(target = 'aaa.dvi', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.dvi
env.DVI(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.ltx')
# builds from ccc.latex
env.DVI(target = 'ccc.dvi', source = 'ccc.latex')

   Gs()
          env.Gs()
          A Builder for explicitly calling the gs executable. Depending on
          the underlying OS, the different names gs, gsos2 and gswin32c
          are tried.

env = Environment(tools=['gs'])
env.Gs(
    'cover.jpg',
    'scons-scons.pdf',
    GSFLAGS='-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=jpeg -dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=1 -q',
)

   Install()
          env.Install()
          Installs one or more source files or directories in the
          specified target, which must be a directory. The names of the
          specified source files or directories remain the same within the
          destination directory. The sources may be given as a string or
          as a node returned by a builder.

env.Install(target='/usr/local/bin', source=['foo', 'bar'])

          Note that if target paths chosen for the Install builder (and
          the related InstallAs and InstallVersionedLib builders) are
          outside the project tree, such as in the example above, they may
          not be selected for "building" by default, since in the absence
          of other instructions scons builds targets that are underneath
          the top directory (the directory that contains the SConstruct
          file, usually the current directory). Use command line targets
          or the Default function in this case.

          If the --install-sandbox command line option is given, the
          target directory will be prefixed by the directory path
          specified. This is useful to test installation behavior without
          installing to a "live" location in the system.

          See also [1288]FindInstalledFiles. For more thoughts on
          installation, see the User Guide (particularly the section on
          Command-Line Targets and the chapters on Installing Files and on
          Alias Targets).

   InstallAs()
          env.InstallAs()
          Installs one or more source files or directories to specific
          names, allowing changing a file or directory name as part of the
          installation. It is an error if the target and source arguments
          list different numbers of files or directories.

env.InstallAs(target='/usr/local/bin/foo',
              source='foo_debug')
env.InstallAs(target=['../lib/libfoo.a', '../lib/libbar.a'],
              source=['libFOO.a', 'libBAR.a'])

          See the note under Install.

   InstallVersionedLib()
          env.InstallVersionedLib()
          Installs a versioned shared library. The symlinks appropriate to
          the architecture will be generated based on symlinks of the
          source library.

env.InstallVersionedLib(target='/usr/local/bin/foo',
                        source='libxyz.1.5.2.so')

          See the note under Install.

   Jar()
          env.Jar()
          Builds a Java archive (.jar) file from the specified list of
          sources. Any directories in the source list will be searched for
          .class files). Any .java files in the source list will be
          compiled to .class files by calling the [1289]Java Builder.

          If the [1290]$JARCHDIR value is set, the jar command will change
          to the specified directory using the -C option. If $JARCHDIR is
          not set explicitly, SCons will use the top of any subdirectory
          tree in which Java .class were built by the [1291]Java Builder.

          If the contents any of the source files begin with the string
          Manifest-Version, the file is assumed to be a manifest and is
          passed to the jar command with the m option set.

env.Jar(target = 'foo.jar', source = 'classes')

env.Jar(target = 'bar.jar',
        source = ['bar1.java', 'bar2.java'])

   Java()
          env.Java()
          Builds one or more Java class files. The sources may be any
          combination of explicit .java files, or directory trees which
          will be scanned for .java files.

          SCons will parse each source .java file to find the classes
          (including inner classes) defined within that file, and from
          that figure out the target .class files that will be created.
          The class files will be placed underneath the specified target
          directory.

          SCons will also search each Java file for the Java package name,
          which it assumes can be found on a line beginning with the
          string package in the first column; the resulting .class files
          will be placed in a directory reflecting the specified package
          name. For example, the file Foo.java defining a single public
          Foo class and containing a package name of sub.dir will generate
          a corresponding sub/dir/Foo.class class file.

          Examples:

env.Java(target='classes', source='src')
env.Java(target='classes', source=['src1', 'src2'])
env.Java(target='classes', source=['File1.java', 'File2.java'])

          Java source files can use the native encoding for the underlying
          OS. Since SCons compiles in simple ASCII mode by default, the
          compiler will generate warnings about unmappable characters,
          which may lead to errors as the file is processed further. In
          this case, the user must specify the LANG environment variable
          to tell the compiler what encoding is used. For portability,
          it's best if the encoding is hard-coded, so that the compilation
          works when run on a system with a different encoding.

env = Environment()
env['ENV']['LANG'] = 'en_GB.UTF-8'

   JavaH()
          env.JavaH()
          Builds C header and source files for implementing Java native
          methods. The target can be either a directory in which the
          header files will be written, or a header file name which will
          contain all of the definitions. The source can be the names of
          .class files, the names of .java files to be compiled into
          .class files by calling the [1292]Java builder method, or the
          objects returned from the Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [1293]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the JavaH builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

          Examples:

# builds java_native.h
classes = env.Java(target="classdir", source="src")
env.JavaH(target="java_native.h", source=classes)

# builds include/package_foo.h and include/package_bar.h
env.JavaH(target="include", source=["package/foo.class", "package/bar.class"])

# builds export/foo.h and export/bar.h
env.JavaH(
    target="export",
    source=["classes/foo.class", "classes/bar.class"],
    JAVACLASSDIR="classes",
)

Note

          Java versions starting with 10.0 no longer use the javah command
          for generating JNI headers/sources, and indeed have removed the
          command entirely (see Java Enhancement Proposal [1294]JEP 313),
          making this tool harder to use for that purpose. SCons may
          autodiscover a javah belonging to an older release if there are
          multiple Java versions on the system, which will lead to
          incorrect results. To use with a newer Java, override the
          default values of [1295]$JAVAH (to contain the path to the
          javac) and [1296]$JAVAHFLAGS (to contain at least a -h flag) and
          note that generating headers with javac requires supplying
          source .java files only, not .class files.

   Library()
          env.Library()
          A synonym for the StaticLibrary builder method.

   LoadableModule()
          env.LoadableModule()
          On most systems, this is the same as SharedLibrary. On Mac OS X
          (Darwin) platforms, this creates a loadable module bundle.

   M4()
          env.M4()
          Builds an output file from an M4 input file. This uses a default
          [1297]$M4FLAGS value of -E, which considers all warnings to be
          fatal and stops on the first warning when using the GNU version
          of m4. Example:

env.M4(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.c.m4')

   Moc()
          env.Moc()
          Builds an output file from a moc input file. moc input files are
          either header files or C++ files. This builder is only available
          after using the tool [1298]qt3. See the [1299]$QT3DIR variable
          for more information. Example:

env.Moc('foo.h')  # generates moc_foo.cc
env.Moc('foo.cpp')  # generates foo.moc

   MOFiles()
          env.MOFiles()
          This builder is set up by the [1300]msgfmt tool. The builder
          compiles PO files to MO files. MOFiles is a single-source
          builder. The source parameter can also be omitted if
          [1301]$LINGUAS_FILE is set.

          Example 1. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po:

env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'])

          Example 2. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE=True)

          Example 3. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po
          plus files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'], LINGUAS_FILE=True)

          Example 4. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file
          (another version):

env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = True
env.MOFiles()

   MSVSProject()
          env.MSVSProject()
          Build a Microsoft Visual C++ project file and solution file.

          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ project file based on the version
          of Visual Studio (or to be more precise, of MSBuild) that is
          configured: either the latest installed version, or the version
          specified by [1302]$MSVC_VERSION in the current construction
          environment. For Visual Studio 6.0 a .dsp file is generated. For
          Visual Studio versions 2002-2008, a .vcproj file is generated.
          For Visual Studio 2010 and later a .vcxproj file is generated.
          Note there are multiple versioning schemes involved in the
          Microsoft compilation environment - see the description of
          [1303]$MSVC_VERSION for equivalences. Note SCons does not know
          how to construct project files for other languages (e.g. .csproj
          for C#, .vbproj for Visual Basic or .pyproject for Python).

          For the .vcxproj file, the underlying format is the MSBuild XML
          Schema, and the details conform to:
          [1304]https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/vcxp
          roj-file-structure. The generated solution file enables Visual
          Studio to understand the project structure, and allows building
          it using MSBuild to call back to SCons. The project file encodes
          a toolset version that has been selected by SCons as described
          above. Since recent Visual Studio versions support multiple
          concurrent toolsets, use [1305]$MSVC_VERSION to select the
          desired one if it does not match the SCons default. The project
          file also includes entries which describe how to call SCons to
          build the project from within Visual Studio (or from an MSBuild
          command line). In some situations SCons may generate this
          incorrectly - notably when using the scons-local distribution,
          which is not installed in a way that that matches the default
          invocation line. If so, the [1306]$SCONS_HOME construction
          variable can be used to describe the right way to locate the
          SCons code so that it can be imported.

          By default, a matching solution file for the project is also
          generated. This behavior may be disabled by specifying
          auto_build_solution=0 to the MSVSProject builder. The solution
          file can also be independently generated by calling the
          MSVSSolution builder, such as in the case where a solution
          should describe multiple projects. See the [1307]MSVSSolution
          description for further information.

          The MSVSProject builder accepts several keyword arguments
          describing lists of filenames to be placed into the project
          file. Currently, srcs, incs, localincs, resources, and misc are
          recognized. The names are intended to be self-explanatory, but
          note that the filenames need to be specified as strings, not as
          SCons File Nodes (for example if you generate files for
          inclusion by using the [1308]Glob function, the results should
          be converted to a list of strings before passing them to
          MSVSProject). This is because Visual Studio and MSBuild know
          nothing about SCons Node types. Each of the filename lists are
          individually optional, but at least one list must be specified
          for the resulting project file to be non-empty.

          In addition to the above lists of values, the following values
          may be specified as keyword arguments:

        target
                The name of the target .dsp or .vcproj file. The correct
                suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but
                the [1309]$MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX construction variable will be
                defined to the correct value (see example below).

        variant
                The name of this particular variant. Except for Visual
                Studio 6 projects, this can also be a list of variant
                names. These are typically things like "Debug" or
                "Release", but really can be anything you want. For Visual
                Studio 7 projects, they may also specify a target platform
                separated from the variant name by a | (vertical pipe)
                character: Debug|Xbox. The default target platform is
                Win32. Multiple calls to MSVSProject with different
                variants are allowed; all variants will be added to the
                project file with their appropriate build targets and
                sources.

        cmdargs
                Additional command line arguments for the different
                variants. The number of cmdargs entries must match the
                number of variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If
                you give only one, it will automatically be propagated to
                all variants.

        cppdefines
                Preprocessor definitions for the different variants. The
                number of cppdefines entries must match the number of
                variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give
                only one, it will automatically be propagated to all
                variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use
                the invoking environment's [1310]$CPPDEFINES entry for all
                variants.

        cppflags
                Compiler flags for the different variants. If a /std:c++
                flag is found then /Zc:__cplusplus is appended to the
                flags if not already found, this ensures that Intellisense
                uses the /std:c++ switch. The number of cppflags entries
                must match the number of variant entries, or be empty (not
                specified). If you give only one, it will automatically be
                propagated to all variants. If you don't give this
                parameter, SCons will combine the invoking environment's
                [1311]$CCFLAGS, [1312]$CXXFLAGS, [1313]$CPPFLAGS entries
                for all variants.

        cpppaths
                Compiler include paths for the different variants. The
                number of cpppaths entries must match the number of
                variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give
                only one, it will automatically be propagated to all
                variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use
                the invoking environment's [1314]$CPPPATH entry for all
                variants.

        buildtarget
                An optional string, node, or list of strings or nodes (one
                per build variant), to tell the Visual Studio debugger
                what output target to use in what build variant. The
                number of buildtarget entries must match the number of
                variant entries.

        runfile
                The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later will
                run and debug. This appears as the value of the Output
                field in the resulting Microsoft Visual C++ project file.
                If this is not specified, the default is the same as the
                specified buildtarget value.

Note

          SCons and Microsoft Visual Studio understand projects in
          different ways, and the mapping is sometimes imperfect:

          Because SCons always executes its build commands from the
          directory in which the SConstruct file is located, if you
          generate a project file in a different directory than the
          directory of the SConstruct file, users will not be able to
          double-click on the file name in compilation error messages
          displayed in the Visual Studio console output window. This can
          be remedied by adding the Microsoft Visual C++ /FC compiler
          option to the [1315]$CCFLAGS variable so that the compiler will
          print the full path name of any files that cause compilation
          errors.

          If the project file is only used to teach the Visual Studio
          project browser about the file layout there should be no issues,
          However, Visual Studio should not be used to make changes to the
          project structure, build options, etc. as these will (a) not
          feed back to the SCons description of the project and (b) be
          lost if SCons regenerates the project file. The SConscript files
          should remain the definitive description of the build.

          If the project file is used to drive MSBuild (such as selecting
          "build" from the Visual Studio interface) you lose the direct
          control of target selection and command-line options you would
          have if launching the build directly from SCons, because these
          will be hard-coded in the project file to the values specified
          in the MSVSProject call. You can regain some of this control by
          defining multiple variants, using multiple MSVSProject calls to
          arrange different build targets, arguments, defines, flags and
          paths for different variants.

          If the build is divided into a solution with multiple MSBuild
          projects the mapping is further strained. In this case, it is
          important not to set Visual Studio to do parallel builds, as it
          will then launch the separate project builds in parallel, and
          SCons does not work well if called that way. Instead, you can
          set up the SCons build for parallel building - see the
          [1316]SetOption function for how to do this with num_jobs.

          Example usage:

barsrcs = ['bar.cpp']
barincs = ['bar.h']
barlocalincs = ['StdAfx.h']
barresources = ['bar.rc', 'resource.h']
barmisc = ['bar_readme.txt']

dll = env.SharedLibrary(target='bar.dll', source=barsrcs)
buildtarget = [s for s in dll if str(s).endswith('dll')]
env.MSVSProject(
    target='Bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX'],
    srcs=barsrcs,
    incs=barincs,
    localincs=barlocalincs,
    resources=barresources,
    misc=barmisc,
    buildtarget=buildtarget,
    variant='Release',
)

        DebugSettings
                A dictionary of debug settings that get written to the
                .vcproj.user or the .vcxproj.user file, depending on the
                version installed. As for cmdargs, you can specify a
                DebugSettings dictionary per variant. If you give only
                one, it will be propagated to all variants.

                Changed in version 2.4: Added the optional DebugSettings
                parameter.

          Currently, only Visual Studio v9.0 and Visual Studio version v11
          are implemented, for other versions no file is generated. To
          generate the user file, you just need to add a DebugSettings
          dictionary to the environment with the right parameters for your
          MSVS version. If the dictionary is empty, or does not contain
          any good value, no file will be generated.

          Following is a more contrived example, involving the setup of a
          project for variants and DebugSettings:

# Assuming you store your defaults in a file
vars = Variables('variables.py')
msvcver = vars.args.get('vc', '9')

# Check command args to force one Microsoft Visual Studio version
if msvcver == '9' or msvcver == '11':
    env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION=msvcver + '.0', MSVC_BATCH=False)
else:
    env = Environment()

AddOption(
    '--userfile',
    action='store_true',
    dest='userfile',
    default=False,
    help="Create Visual C++ project file",
)

   MSVSSolution()
          env.MSVSSolution()
          Build a Microsoft Visual Studio Solution file.

          Builds a Visual Studio solution file based on the version of
          Visual Studio that is configured: either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [1317]$MSVC_VERSION in the
          construction environment. For Visual Studio 6, a .dsw file is
          generated. For Visual Studio .NET 2002 and later, it will
          generate a .sln file. Note there are multiple versioning schemes
          involved in the Microsoft compilation environment - see the
          description of [1318]$MSVC_VERSION for equivalences.

          The solution file is a container for one or more projects, and
          follows the format described at
          [1319]https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibili
          ty/internals/solution-dot-sln-file.

          The following values must be specified:

        target
                The name of the target .dsw or .sln file. The correct
                suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but
                the value [1320]$MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX will be defined to the
                correct value (see example below).

        variant
                The name of this particular variant, or a list of variant
                names (the latter is only supported for MSVS 7 solutions).
                These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but
                really can be anything you want. For MSVS 7 they may also
                specify target platform, like this "Debug|Xbox". Default
                platform is Win32.

        projects
                A list of project file names, or Project nodes returned by
                calls to the [1321]MSVSProject Builder, to be placed into
                the solution file. Note that these filenames need to be
                specified as strings, NOT as SCons File Nodes. This is
                because the solution file will be interpreted by MSBuild
                and by Visual Studio, which know nothing about SCons Node
                types.

          In addition to the mandatory arguments above, the following
          optional values may be specified as keyword arguments:

        auto_filter_projects
                Under certain circumstances, solution file names or
                solution file nodes may be present in the projects
                argument list. When solution file names or nodes are
                present in the projects argument list, the generated
                solution file may contain erroneous Project records
                resulting in VS IDE error messages when opening the
                generated solution file. By default, an exception is
                raised when a solution file name or solution file node is
                detected in the projects argument list.

                The accepted values for auto_filter_projects are:

              None
                      An exception is raised when a solution file name or
                      solution file node is detected in the projects
                      argument list.

                      None is the default value.

              True or evaluates True
                      Automatically remove solution file names and
                      solution file nodes from the projects argument list.

              False or evaluates False
                      Leave the solution file names and solution file
                      nodes in the projects argument list. An exception is
                      not raised.

                      When opening the generated solution file with the VS
                      IDE, the VS IDE will likely report that there are
                      erroneous Project records that are not supported or
                      that need to be modified.

          Example Usage:

env.MSVSSolution(
    target="Bar" + env["MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX"],
    projects=["bar" + env["MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX"]],
    variant="Release",
)

   Ninja()
          env.Ninja()
          A special builder which adds a target to create a Ninja build
          file. The builder does not require any source files to be
          specified.

Note

          This is an experimental feature. To enable it you must use one
          of the following methods

# On the command line
--experimental=ninja

# Or in your SConstruct
SetOption('experimental', 'ninja')

          This functionality is subject to change and/or removal without
          deprecation cycle.

          To use this tool you need to install the Python ninja package,
          as the tool by default depends on being able to do an import of
          the package This can be done via:

python -m pip install ninja

          If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a
          target name of ninja.build.

          If called with a single positional argument, scons will "deduce"
          the target name from that source argument, giving it the same
          name, and then ignore the source. This is the usual way to call
          the builder if a non-default target name is wanted.

          If called with either the target= or source= keyword arguments,
          the value of the argument is taken as the target name. If called
          with both, the target= value is used and source= is ignored. If
          called with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored,
          since there is no way to deduce what the intent was; in this
          case the default target name will be used.

          Available since scons 4.2.

   Object()
          env.Object()
          A synonym for the StaticObject builder method.

   Package()
          env.Package()
          Builds software distribution packages. A package is a container
          format which includes files to install along with metadata.
          Packaging is optional, and must be enabled by specifying the
          [1322]packaging tool. For example:

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'packaging'])

          SCons can build packages in a number of well known packaging
          formats. The target package type may be selected with the
          [1323]$PACKAGETYPE construction variable or the --package-type
          command line option. The package type may be a list, in which
          case SCons will attempt to build packages for each type in the
          list. Example:

env.Package(PACKAGETYPE=['src_zip', 'src_targz'], ...other args...)

          The currently supported packagers are:

   msi Microsoft Installer package
   rpm RPM Package Manager package
   ipkg Itsy Package Management package
   tarbz2 bzip2-compressed tar file
   targz gzip-compressed tar file
   tarxz xz-compressed tar file
   zip zip file
   src_tarbz2 bzip2-compressed tar file suitable as source to another
   packager
   src_targz gzip-compressed tar file suitable as source to another
   packager
   src_tarxz xz-compressed tar file suitable as source to another packager
   src_zip zip file suitable as source to another packager

          The file list to include in the package may be specified with
          the source keyword argument. If omitted, the
          [1324]FindInstalledFiles function is called behind the scenes to
          select all files that have an [1325]Install, [1326]InstallAs or
          [1327]InstallVersionedLib Builder attached. If the target
          keyword argument is omitted, the target name(s) will be deduced
          from the package type(s).

          The metadata comes partly from attributes of the files to be
          packaged, and partly from packaging tags. Tags can be passed as
          keyword arguments to the Package builder call, and may also be
          attached to files (or more accurately, Nodes representing files)
          with the [1328]Tag function. Some package-level tags are
          mandatory, and will lead to errors if omitted. The mandatory
          tags vary depending on the package type.

          While packaging, the builder uses a temporary location named by
          the value of the [1329]$PACKAGEROOT variable - the package
          sources are copied there before packaging.

          Packaging example:

env = Environment(tools=["default", "packaging"])
env.Install("/bin/", "my_program")
env.Package(
    NAME="foo",
    VERSION="1.2.3",
    PACKAGEVERSION=0,
    PACKAGETYPE="rpm",
    LICENSE="gpl",
    SUMMARY="balalalalal",
    DESCRIPTION="this should be really really long",
    X_RPM_GROUP="Application/fu",
    SOURCE_URL="https://foo.org/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz",
)

          In this example, the target /bin/my_program created by the
          Install call would not be built by default since it is not under
          the project top directory. However, since no source is specified
          to the Package builder, it is selected for packaging by the
          default sources rule. Since packaging is done using
          [1330]$PACKAGEROOT, no write is actually done to the system's
          /bin directory, and the target will be selected since after
          rebasing to underneath $PACKAGEROOT it is now under the top
          directory of the project.

   PCH()
          env.PCH()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header. Calling this
          builder returns a list of two target nodes: the PCH as the first
          element, and the object file as the second element. Normally the
          object file is ignored. The PCH builder is generally used in
          conjunction with the [1331]$PCH construction variable to force
          object files to use the precompiled header:

env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]

Note

          This builder is specific to the PCH implementation in Microsoft
          Visual C++. Other compiler chains also implement precompiled
          header support, but PCH does not work with them at this time. As
          a result, the builder is only generated into the construction
          environment when Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the
          compiler.

          The builder only works correctly in a C++ project. The Microsoft
          implementation distinguishes between precompiled headers from C
          and C++. Use of the builder will cause the PCH generation to
          happen with a flag that tells cl.exe all of the files are C++
          files; if that PCH file is then supplied when compiling a C
          source file, cl.exe will fail the build with a compatibility
          violation.

          If possible, arrange the project so that a C++ source file
          passed to the PCH builder is not also included in the list of
          sources to be otherwise compiled in the project. SCons will
          correctly track that file in the dependency tree as a result of
          the PCH call, and (for MSVC 11.0 and greater) automatically add
          the corresponding object file to the link line. If the source
          list is automatically generated, for example using the
          [1332]Glob function, it may be necessary to remove that file
          from the list.

   PDF()
          env.PDF()
          Builds a .pdf file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [1333]$PDFSUFFIX construction variable (.pdf by default) is
          added automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          PDF is a single-source builder. Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PDF(target = 'aaa.pdf', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.pdf from bbb.dvi
env.PDF(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   POInit()
          env.POInit()
          This builder is set up by the [1334]msginit tool. The builder
          initializes missing PO file(s) if [1335]$POAUTOINIT is set. If
          [1336]$POAUTOINIT is not set (the default), POInit prints
          instruction for the user (such as a translator), telling how the
          PO file should be initialized. In normal projects you should not
          use POInit and use [1337]POUpdate instead. [1338]POUpdate
          chooses intelligently between msgmerge(1) and msginit(1). POInit
          always uses msginit(1) and should be regarded as builder for
          special purposes or for temporary use (e.g. for quick, one time
          initialization of a bunch of PO files) or for tests. POInit is a
          single-source builder. The source parameter can also be omitted
          if [1339]$LINGUAS_FILE is set.

          Target nodes defined through POInit are not built by default
          (they're Ignored from '.' node) but are added to special
          [1340]Alias ('po-create' by default). The alias name may be
          changed through the [1341]$POCREATE_ALIAS construction variable.
          All PO files defined through POInit may be easily initialized by
          scons po-create.

          Example 1. Initialize en.po and pl.po from messages.pot:

env.POInit(['en', 'pl']) # messages.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 2. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot:

env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], ['foo']) # foo.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 3. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot but using the
          [1342]$POTDOMAIN construction variable:

env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo') # foo.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 4. Initialize PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS
          file. The files will be initialized from template messages.pot:

env.POInit(LINGUAS_FILE=True)  # needs 'LINGUAS' file

          Example 5. Initialize en.po and pl.pl PO files plus files for
          languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files will be initialized
          from template messages.pot:

env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], LINGUAS_FILE=True)

          Example 6. You may preconfigure your environment first, and then
          initialize PO files:

env['POAUTOINIT'] = True
env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = True
env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
env.POInit()

          which has same efect as:

env.POInit(POAUTOINIT=True, LINGUAS_FILE=True, POTDOMAIN='foo')

   PostScript()
          env.PostScript()
          Builds a .ps file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [1343]$PSSUFFIX construction variable (.ps by default) is added
          automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          PostScript is a single-source builder. Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PostScript(target = 'aaa.ps', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.ps from bbb.dvi
env.PostScript(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   POTUpdate()
          env.POTUpdate()
          The builder is set up by the [1344]xgettext tool, part of the
          [1345]gettext toolset. The builder updates the target POT file
          if exists or creates it if it doesn't. The target node is not
          selected for building by default (e.g. scons .), but only on
          demand (i.e. when the given POT file is required or when special
          alias is invoked). This builder adds its target node
          (messages.pot, say) to a special alias (pot-update by default,
          see [1346]$POTUPDATE_ALIAS) so you can update/create them easily
          with scons pot-update. The file is not written until there is no
          real change in internationalized messages (or in comments that
          enter POT file).

Note

          You may see xgettext(1) being invoked by the [1347]xgettext tool
          even if there is no real change in internationalized messages
          (so the POT file is not being updated). This happens every time
          a source file has changed. In such case we invoke xgettext(1)
          and compare its output with the content of POT file to decide
          whether the file should be updated or not.

          Example 1. Let's create po/ directory and place following
          SConstruct script there:

# SConstruct in 'po/' subdir
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env.POTUpdate(['foo'], ['../a.cpp', '../b.cpp'])
env.POTUpdate(['bar'], ['../c.cpp', '../d.cpp'])

          Then invoke scons few times:

$ scons             # Does not create foo.pot nor bar.pot
$ scons foo.pot     # Updates or creates foo.pot
$ scons pot-update  # Updates or creates foo.pot and bar.pot
$ scons -c          # Does not clean foo.pot nor bar.pot.

          the results shall be as the comments above say.

          Example 2. The target argument can be omitted, in which case the
          default target name messages.pot is used. The target may also be
          overridden by setting the [1348]$POTDOMAIN construction variable
          or providing it as an override to the POTUpdate builder:

# SConstruct script
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env['POTDOMAIN'] = "foo"
env.POTUpdate(source=["a.cpp", "b.cpp"])  # Creates foo.pot ...
env.POTUpdate(POTDOMAIN="bar", source=["c.cpp", "d.cpp"])  # and bar.pot

          Example 3. The source parameter may also be omitted, if it is
          specified in a separate file, for example POTFILES.in:

# POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory
../a.cpp
../b.cpp
# end of file

          The name of the file (POTFILES.in) containing the list of
          sources is provided via [1349]$XGETTEXTFROM:

# SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in')

          Example 4. You can use [1350]$XGETTEXTPATH to define the source
          search path. Assume, for example, that you have files a.cpp,
          b.cpp, po/SConstruct, po/POTFILES.in. Then your POT-related
          files could look like this:

# POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory
a.cpp
b.cpp
# end of file

# SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH='../')

          Example 5. Multiple search directories may be defined as a list,
          i.e. XGETTEXTPATH=['dir1', 'dir2', ...]. The order in the list
          determines the search order of source files. The path to the
          first file found is used.

          Let's create 0/1/po/SConstruct script:

# SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../', '../../'])

          and 0/1/po/POTFILES.in:

# POTFILES.in in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
a.cpp
# end of file

          Write two *.cpp files, the first one is 0/a.cpp:

/* 0/a.cpp */
gettext("Hello from ../../a.cpp")

          and the second is 0/1/a.cpp:

/* 0/1/a.cpp */
gettext("Hello from ../a.cpp")

          then run scons. You'll obtain 0/1/po/messages.pot with the
          message "Hello from ../a.cpp". When you reverse order in
          $XGETTEXTFOM, i.e. when you write SConscript as

# SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../../', '../'])

          then the messages.pot will contain msgid "Hello from
          ../../a.cpp" line and not msgid "Hello from ../a.cpp".

   POUpdate()
          env.POUpdate()
          The builder is set up by the [1351]msgmerge tool. part of the
          [1352]gettext toolset. The builder updates PO files with
          msgmerge(1), or initializes missing PO files as described in the
          documentation of the [1353]msginit tool and the [1354]POInit
          builder (see also [1355]$POAUTOINIT). POUpdate is a
          single-source builder. The source parameter can also be omitted
          if [1356]$LINGUAS_FILE is set.

          The target nodes are not selected for building by default (e.g.
          scons .). Instead, they are added automatically to special
          [1357]Alias ('po-update' by default). The alias name may be
          changed through the [1358]$POUPDATE_ALIAS construction variable.
          You can easily update PO files in your project by scons
          po-update. Note that POUpdate does not add its targets to the
          po-create alias as [1359]POInit does.

          Example 1. Update en.po and pl.po from messages.pot template
          (see also [1360]$POTDOMAIN), assuming that the later one exists
          or there is rule to build it (see [1361]POTUpdate):

env.POUpdate(['en','pl'])  # messages.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 2. Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot template:

env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], ['foo'])  # foo.pot -->  [en.po, pl.pl]

          Example 3. Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot (another
          version):

env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo')  # foo.pot -- > [en.po, pl.pl]

          Example 4. Update files for languages defined in LINGUAS file.
          The files are updated from messages.pot template:

env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE=True)  # needs 'LINGUAS' file

          Example 5. Same as above, but update from foo.pot template:

env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE=True, source=['foo'])

          Example 6. Update en.po and pl.po plus files for languages
          defined in LINGUAS file. The files are updated from messages.pot
          template:

# produce 'en.po', 'pl.po' + files defined in 'LINGUAS':
env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl' ], LINGUAS_FILE=True)

          Example 7. Use [1362]$POAUTOINIT to automatically initialize PO
          file if it doesn't exist:

env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE=True, POAUTOINIT=True)

          Example 8. Update PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS
          file. The files are updated from foo.pot template. All necessary
          settings are pre-configured via environment.

env['POAUTOINIT'] = True
env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = True
env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
env.POUpdate()

   Program()
          env.Program()
          Builds an executable given one or more object files or C, C++,
          D, or Fortran source files. If any C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files are specified, then they will be automatically compiled to
          object files using the Object builder method; see that builder
          method's description for a list of legal source file suffixes
          and how they are interpreted. The target executable file prefix,
          specified by the [1363]$PROGPREFIX construction variable
          (nothing by default), and suffix, specified by the
          [1364]$PROGSUFFIX construction variable (by default, .exe on
          Windows systems, nothing on POSIX systems), are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.Program(target='foo', source=['foo.o', 'bar.c', 'baz.f'])

   ProgramAllAtOnce()
          env.ProgramAllAtOnce()
          Builds an executable from D sources without first creating
          individual objects for each file.

          D sources can be compiled file-by-file as C and C++ source are,
          and D is integrated into the scons Object and Program builders
          for this model of build. D codes can though do whole source
          meta-programming (some of the testing frameworks do this). For
          this it is imperative that all sources are compiled and linked
          in a single call to the D compiler. This builder serves that
          purpose.

    env.ProgramAllAtOnce('executable', ['mod_a.d, mod_b.d', 'mod_c.d'])

          This command will compile the modules mod_a, mod_b, and mod_c in
          a single compilation process without first creating object files
          for the modules. Some of the D compilers will create
          executable.o others will not.

   RES()
          env.RES()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ resource file. This builder method
          is only provided when Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW is being
          used as the compiler. The .res (or .o for MinGW) suffix is added
          to the target name if no other suffix is given. The source file
          is scanned for implicit dependencies as though it were a C file.
          Example:

env.RES('resource.rc')

   RMIC()
          env.RMIC()
          Builds stub and skeleton class files for remote objects from
          Java .class files. The target is a directory relative to which
          the stub and skeleton class files will be written. The source
          can be the names of .class files, or the objects return from the
          Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [1365]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the RMIC builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

classes = env.Java(target='classdir', source='src')
env.RMIC(target='outdir1', source=classes)
env.RMIC(
    target='outdir2',
    source=['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'],
)
env.RMIC(
    target='outdir3',
    source=['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
    JAVACLASSDIR='classes',
)

   RPCGenClient()
          env.RPCGenClient()
          Generates an RPC client stub (_clnt.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_clnt.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenHeader()
          env.RPCGenHeader()
          Generates an RPC header (.h) file from a specified RPC (.x)
          source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif.h
env.RPCGenHeader('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenService()
          env.RPCGenService()
          Generates an RPC server-skeleton (_svc.c) file from a specified
          RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in
          the local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_svc.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenXDR()
          env.RPCGenXDR()
          Generates an RPC XDR routine (_xdr.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_xdr.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   SharedLibrary()
          env.SharedLibrary()
          Builds a shared library given one or more object files and/or C,
          C++, D or Fortran source files. Any source files listed in the
          source parameter will be automatically compiled to object files
          suitable for use in a shared library. Any object files listed in
          the source parameter must have been built for a shared library
          (that is, using the SharedObject builder method). scons will
          raise an error if there is any mismatch.

          The target library file prefix, specified by the
          [1366]$SHLIBPREFIX construction variable (by default, lib on
          POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems), and suffix,
          specified by the [1367]$SHLIBSUFFIX construction variable (by
          default, .dll on Windows systems, .so on POSIX systems), are
          automatically added (if not already present) to the target name
          to make up the library filename. On a POSIX system, if the
          [1368]$SHLIBVERSION construction variable is set, it is appended
          (following a period) to the resulting library name.

          Example:

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          On Windows systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always
          build an import library (.lib) in addition to the shared library
          (.dll), adding a .lib library with the same basename if there is
          not already a .lib file explicitly listed in the targets.

          On Cygwin systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always
          build an import library (.dll.a) in addition to the shared
          library (.dll), adding a .dll.a library with the same basename
          if there is not already a .dll.a file explicitly listed in the
          targets.

          On some platforms, there is a distinction between a shared
          library (loaded automatically by the system to resolve external
          references) and a loadable module (explicitly loaded by user
          action). For maximum portability, use the [1369]LoadableModule
          builder for the latter.

          If [1370]$SHLIBVERSION is defined, a versioned shared library is
          created. This modifies [1371]$SHLINKFLAGS as required, adds the
          version number to the library name, and creates any symbolic
          links that are needed.

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'], SHLIBVERSION='1.5.2')

          On a POSIX system, supplying a simple version string (no dots)
          creates exactly one symbolic link: SHLIBVERSION="1" would create
          (for example) library libbar.so.1 and symbolic link libbar.so.
          Supplying a dotted version string will create two symbolic links
          (irrespective of the number of segments in the version):
          SHLIBVERSION="1.5.2" for the same library would create library
          libbar.so.1.5.2 and symbolic links libbar.so and libbar.so.1. A
          Darwin (OSX) system creates one symlink in either case, for the
          second example the library would be libbar.1.5.2.dylib and the
          link would be libbar.dylib.

          On Windows systems, specifying the register=1 keyword argument
          will cause the .dll to be registered after it is built. The
          command that is run is determined by the [1372]$REGSVR
          construction variable (regsvr32 by default), and the flags
          passed are determined by [1373]$REGSVRFLAGS. By default,
          [1374]$REGSVRFLAGS includes the /s option, to prevent dialogs
          from popping up and requiring user attention when it is run. If
          you change [1375]$REGSVRFLAGS, be sure to include the /s option.
          For example,

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.cxx', 'foo.obj'], register=1)

          will register bar.dll as a COM object when it is done linking
          it.

   SharedObject()
          env.SharedObject()
          Builds an object file intended for inclusion in a shared
          library. Source files must have one of the same set of
          extensions specified for the [1376]StaticObject builder method.
          The target object file prefix, specified by the
          [1377]$SHOBJPREFIX construction variable (by default, the same
          as [1378]$OBJPREFIX), and suffix, specified by the
          [1379]$SHOBJSUFFIX construction variable, are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. SharedObject is a
          single-source builder. Examples:

env.SharedObject(target='ddd', source='ddd.c')
env.SharedObject(target='eee.o', source='eee.cpp')
env.SharedObject(target='fff.obj', source='fff.for')
env.SharedObject(source=Glob('*.c'))

          On some platforms building a shared object requires additional
          compiler option(s) (e.g. -fPIC for gcc) in addition to those
          needed to build a normal (static) object. If shared and static
          objects differ, SCons will allow only shared objects to be
          linked into a shared library, and will use a different suffix
          for shared objects to help indicate and track the difference.

          Source files will be scanned according to the suffix mappings in
          the SourceFileScanner object. See the manpage section "Scanner
          Objects" for more information.

   StaticLibrary()
          env.StaticLibrary()
          Builds a static library given one or more object files or C,
          C++, D or Fortran source files. If any source files are given,
          then they will be automatically compiled to object files. The
          static library file prefix, specified by the [1380]$LIBPREFIX
          construction variable (by default, lib on POSIX systems, nothing
          on Windows systems), and suffix, specified by the
          [1381]$LIBSUFFIX construction variable (by default, .lib on
          Windows systems, .a on POSIX systems), are automatically added
          to the target if not already present. Example:

env.StaticLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          static library (that is, using the StaticObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

   StaticObject()
          env.StaticObject()
          Builds a static object file from one or more C, C++, D, or
          Fortran source files. The file extension mapping is shown in the
          table:

            .asm    assembly language file
            .ASM    assembly language file
            .c      C file
            .C      Windows:  C file
                    POSIX:  C++ file

            .m      Object C file
            .mm     Object C++ file
            .s      assembly language file
            .S      Windows:  assembly language file
                    ARM: CodeSourcery Sourcery Lite
            .sx     assembly language file + C pre-processor
                    POSIX:  assembly language file + C pre-processor
            .spp    assembly language file + C pre-processor
            .SPP    assembly language file + C pre-processor
          The target object file prefix, specified by the [1382]$OBJPREFIX
          construction variable (empty string by default), and suffix,
          specified by the [1383]$OBJSUFFIX construction variable (.obj on
          Windows systems, .o on POSIX systems), are automatically added
          to the target if not already present. StaticObject is a
          single-source builder. Examples:

env.StaticObject(target='aaa', source='aaa.c')
env.StaticObject(target='bbb.o', source='bbb.c++')
env.StaticObject(target='ccc.obj', source='ccc.f')
env.StaticObject(source=Glob('*.c'))

          Source files will be scanned according to the suffix mappings in
          the SourceFileScanner object. See the manpage section "Scanner
          Objects" for more information.

   Substfile()
          env.Substfile()
          The Substfile builder creates a single text file from a template
          consisting of a file or set of files (or nodes), replacing text
          using the [1384]$SUBST_DICT construction variable (if set). If a
          set, they are concatenated into the target file using the value
          of the [1385]$LINESEPARATOR construction variable as a separator
          between contents; the separator is not emitted after the
          contents of the last file. Nested lists of source files are
          flattened. See also [1386]Textfile.

          By default, the target file encoding is "utf-8" and can be
          changed by [1387]$FILE_ENCODING Examples:

          If a single source file name is specified and has a .in suffix,
          the suffix is stripped and the remainder of the name is used as
          the default target name.

          The prefix and suffix specified by the [1388]$SUBSTFILEPREFIX
          and [1389]$SUBSTFILESUFFIX construction variables (an empty
          string by default in both cases) are automatically added to the
          target if they are not already present.

          If a construction variable named [1390]$SUBST_DICT is present,
          it may be either a Python dictionary or a sequence of (key,
          value) tuples. If it is a dictionary it is converted into a list
          of tuples with unspecified order, so if one key is a prefix of
          another key or if one substitution could be further expanded by
          another substitution, it is unpredictable whether the expansion
          will occur.

          Any occurrences of a key in the source are replaced by the
          corresponding value, which may be a Python callable function or
          a string. If the value is a callable, it is called with no
          arguments to get a string. Strings are subst-expanded and the
          result replaces the key.

env = Environment(tools=['default'])

env['prefix'] = '/usr/bin'
script_dict = {'@prefix@': '/bin', '@exec_prefix@': '$prefix'}
env.Substfile('script.in', SUBST_DICT=script_dict)

conf_dict = {'%VERSION%': '1.2.3', '%BASE%': 'MyProg'}
env.Substfile('config.h.in', conf_dict, SUBST_DICT=conf_dict)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one key is a prefix of another
bad_foo = {'$foo': '$foo', '$foobar': '$foobar'}
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT=bad_foo)

# PREDICTABLE - keys are applied longest first
good_foo = [('$foobar', '$foobar'), ('$foo', '$foo')]
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT=good_foo)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one substitution could be further expanded
bad_bar = {'@bar@': '@soap@', '@soap@': 'lye'}
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT=bad_bar)

# PREDICTABLE - substitutions are expanded in order
good_bar = (('@bar@', '@soap@'), ('@soap@', 'lye'))
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT=good_bar)

# the SUBST_DICT may be in common (and not an override)
substutions = {}
subst = Environment(tools=['textfile'], SUBST_DICT=substitutions)
substitutions['@foo@'] = 'foo'
subst['SUBST_DICT']['@bar@'] = 'bar'
subst.Substfile(
    'pgm1.c',
    [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'), Value('#include "@bar@.h"'), "common.in", "pgm
1.in"],
)
subst.Substfile(
    'pgm2.c',
    [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'), Value('#include "@bar@.h"'), "common.in", "pgm
2.in"],
)


   Tar()
          env.Tar()
          Builds a tar archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Tar builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Tar('src.tar', 'src')

# Create the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', 'another')

# Set TARFLAGS to create a gzip-filtered archive.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z')
env.Tar('foo.tar.gz', 'foo')

# Also set the suffix to .tgz.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z',
                  TARSUFFIX = '.tgz')
env.Tar('foo')

   Textfile()
          env.Textfile()
          The Textfile builder generates a single text file from a
          template consisting of a list of strings, replacing text using
          the [1391]$SUBST_DICT construction variable (if set) - see
          [1392]Substfile for a description of replacement. The strings
          will be separated in the target file using the value of the
          [1393]$LINESEPARATOR construction variable; the line separator
          is not emitted after the last string. Nested lists of source
          strings are flattened. Source strings need not literally be
          Python strings: they can be Nodes or Python objects that convert
          cleanly to [1394]Value nodes.

          The prefix and suffix specified by the [1395]$TEXTFILEPREFIX and
          [1396]$TEXTFILESUFFIX construction variables (by default an
          empty string and .txt, respectively) are automatically added to
          the target if they are not already present.

          By default, the target file encoding is "utf-8" and can be
          changed by [1397]$FILE_ENCODING Examples:

# builds/writes foo.txt
env.Textfile(target='foo.txt', source=['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'])

# builds/writes bar.txt
env.Textfile(target='bar', source=['lalala', 'tanteratei'], LINESEPARATOR='|*')

# nested lists are flattened automatically
env.Textfile(target='blob', source=['lalala', ['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'], 'tante
ratei'])

# files may be used as input by wrapping them in File()
env.Textfile(
    target='concat',  # concatenate files with a marker between
    source=[File('concat1'), File('concat2')],
    LINESEPARATOR='====================\n',
)

          Results:

          foo.txt

  Goethe
  42
  Schiller

          bar.txt

  lalala|*tanteratei

          blob.txt

  lalala
  Goethe
  42
  Schiller
  tanteratei

   Translate()
          env.Translate()
          This pseudo-Builder is part of the [1398]gettext toolset. The
          builder extracts internationalized messages from source files,
          updates the POT template (if necessary) and then updates PO
          translations (if necessary). If [1399]$POAUTOINIT is set,
          missing PO files will be automatically created (i.e. without
          translator person intervention). The variables
          [1400]$LINGUAS_FILE and [1401]$POTDOMAIN are taken into account
          too. All other construction variables used by [1402]POTUpdate,
          and [1403]POUpdate work here too.

          Example 1. The simplest way is to specify input files and output
          languages inline in a SCons script when invoking Translate:

# SConscript in 'po/' directory
env = Environment(tools=["default", "gettext"])
env['POAUTOINIT'] = True
env.Translate(['en', 'pl'], ['../a.cpp', '../b.cpp'])

          Example 2. If you wish, you may also stick to the conventional
          style known from autotools, i.e. using POTFILES.in and LINGUAS
          files to specify the targets and sources:

# LINGUAS
en pl
# end

# POTFILES.in
a.cpp
b.cpp
# end

# SConscript
env = Environment(tools=["default", "gettext"])
env['POAUTOINIT'] = True
env['XGETTEXTPATH'] = ['../']
env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE=True, XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in')

          The last approach is perhaps the recommended one. It allows
          easily split internationalization/localization onto separate
          SCons scripts, where a script in source tree is responsible for
          translations (from sources to PO files) and script(s) under
          variant directories are responsible for compilation of PO to MO
          files to and for installation of MO files. The "gluing factor"
          synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of LINGUAS
          file. Note, that the updated POT and PO files are usually going
          to be committed back to the repository, so they must be updated
          within the source directory (and not in variant directories).
          Additionally, the file listing of po/ directory contains LINGUAS
          file, so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they
          may work with the project in their usual way.

          Example 3. Let's prepare a development tree as below

 project/
  + SConstruct
  + build/
  + src/
      + po/
          + SConscript
          + SConscript.i18n
          + POTFILES.in
          + LINGUAS

          with build being the variant directory. Write the top-level
          SConstruct script as follows

# SConstruct
env = Environment(tools=["default", "gettext"])
VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=False)
env['POAUTOINIT'] = True
SConscript('src/po/SConscript.i18n', exports='env')
SConscript('build/po/SConscript', exports='env')

          the src/po/SConscript.i18n as

# src/po/SConscript.i18n
Import('env')
env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE=True, XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../'
])

          and the src/po/SConscript

# src/po/SConscript
Import('env')
env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE=True)

          Such a setup produces POT and PO files under the source tree in
          src/po/ and binary MO files under the variant tree in build/po/.
          This way the POT and PO files are separated from other output
          files, which must not be committed back to source repositories
          (e.g. MO files).

Note

          In the above example, the PO files are not updated, nor created
          automatically when you issue the command scons .. The files must
          be updated (created) by hand via scons po-update and then MO
          files can be compiled by running scons ..

   TypeLibrary()
          env.TypeLibrary()
          Builds a Windows type library (.tlb) file from an input IDL file
          (.idl). In addition, it will build the associated interface stub
          and proxy source files, naming them according to the base name
          of the .idl file. For example,

env.TypeLibrary(source="foo.idl")

          Will create foo.tlb, foo.h, foo_i.c, foo_p.c and foo_data.c
          files.

   Uic()
          env.Uic()
          Builds a header file, an implementation file and a moc file from
          an ui file. and returns the corresponding nodes in the that
          order. This builder is only available after using the tool
          [1404]qt3. Note: you can specify .ui files directly as source
          files to the [1405]Program, [1406]Library and
          [1407]SharedLibrary builders without using this builder. Using
          this builder lets you override the standard naming conventions
          (be careful: prefixes are always prepended to names of built
          files; if you don't want prefixes, you may set them to ``). See
          the [1408]$QT3DIR variable for more information. Example:

env.Uic('foo.ui')  # -> ['foo.h', 'uic_foo.cc', 'moc_foo.cc']
env.Uic(
    target=Split('include/foo.h gen/uicfoo.cc gen/mocfoo.cc'),
    source='foo.ui'
)  # -> ['include/foo.h', 'gen/uicfoo.cc', 'gen/mocfoo.cc']

   Zip()
          env.Zip()
          Builds a zip archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Zip builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Zip('src.zip', 'src')

# Create the stuff.zip file.
env.Zip('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Zip('stuff', 'another')

SCons Functions and Environment Methods

   SCons provides a variety of construction environment methods and global
   functions to manipulate the build configuration. Often, a construction
   environment method and a global function with the same name exist for
   convenience. In this section, both forms are shown if the function can
   be called in either way. The documentation style for these is as
   follows:
Function(arguments, [optional arguments, ...])  # Global function
env.Function(arguments, [optional arguments, ...])  # Environment method

   In these function signatures, arguments in brackets ([]) are optional,
   and ellipses (...) indicate possible repetition. Positional vs. keyword
   arguments are usually detailed in the following text, not in the
   signature itself. The Python positional-only (/) and keyword-only (*)
   markers are not used.

   When the Python keyword=value style is shown, it can have two meanings.
   If the keyword argument is known to the function, the value is the
   default for that argument if it is omitted. If the keyword is unknown
   to the function, some methods treat it as a construction variable
   assignment; otherwise an exception is raised for an unknown argument.

   A global function and a same-named construction environment method have
   the same base functionality, with two key differences:
    1. Construction environment methods that change the environment act on
       the environment instance from which they are called, while the
       corresponding global function acts on a special "hidden"
       construction environment called the Default Environment. In some
       cases, the global function may take an initial argument giving the
       object to operate on.
    2. String-valued arguments (including strings in list-valued
       arguments) are subject to construction variable expansion by the
       environment method form; variable expansion is not immediately
       performed in the global function. For example, Default('$MYTARGET')
       adds '$MYTARGET' to the list of default targets, while if the value
       in env of MYTARGET is 'mine', env.Default('$MYTARGET' adds 'mine'
       to the default targets. For more details on construction variable
       expansion, see the [1409]Construction variables section.

   Global functions are automatically in scope inside SConscript files. If
   your project adds Python modules that you include via the Python import
   statement from an SConscript file, such code will need to add the
   functions to that module's global scope explicitly. You can do that by
   adding the following import to the Python module: from SCons.Script
   import *.

   SCons provides the following construction environment methods and
   global functions. The list can be augmented on a project basis using
   [1410]AddMethod

   Action(action, [output, [var, ...]] [key=value, ...])
          env.Action(action, [output, [var, ...]] [key=value, ...])
          A factory function to create an Action object for the specified
          action. See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete
          explanation of the arguments and behavior.

          Note that the env.Action form of the invocation will expand
          construction variables in any argument strings, including the
          action argument, at the time it is called using the construction
          variables in the construction environment through which
          env.Action was called. The Action global function form delays
          all variable expansion until the Action object is actually used.

   AddMethod(object, function, [name])
          env.AddMethod(function, [name])
          Adds function to an object as a method. function will be called
          with an instance object as the first argument as for other
          methods. If name is given, it is used as the name of the new
          method, else the name of function is used.

          When the global function AddMethod is called, the object to add
          the method to must be passed as the first argument; typically
          this will be Environment, in order to create a method which
          applies to all construction environments subsequently
          constructed. When called using the env.AddMethod form, the
          method is added to the specified construction environment only.
          Added methods propagate through env.Clone calls.

          More examples:

# Function to add must accept an instance argument.
# The Python convention is to call this 'self'.
def my_method(self, arg):
    print("my_method() got", arg)

# Use the global function to add a method to the Environment class:
AddMethod(Environment, my_method)
env = Environment()
env.my_method('arg')

# Use the optional name argument to set the name of the method:
env.AddMethod(my_method, 'other_method_name')
env.other_method_name('another arg')

   AddOption(opt_str, ..., attr=value, ...)
          Adds a local (project-specific) command-line option. One or more
          opt_str values are the strings representing how the option can
          be called, while the keyword arguments define attributes of the
          option. For the most part these are the same as for the
          OptionParser.add_option method in the standard Python library
          module optparse, but with a few additional capabilities noted
          below. See the [1411]optparse documentation for a thorough
          discussion of its option-processing capabilities. All options
          added through AddOption are placed in a special "Local Options"
          option group.

          In addition to the arguments and values supported by the
          optparse add_option method, AddOption allows setting the nargs
          keyword value to a string '?' (question mark) to indicate that
          the option argument for that option string may be omitted. If
          the option string is present on the command line but has no
          matching option argument, the value of the const keyword
          argument is produced as the value of the option. If the option
          string is omitted from the command line, the value of the
          default keyword argument is produced, as usual; if there is no
          default keyword argument in the AddOption call, None is
          produced.

          optparse recognizes abbreviations of long option names, as long
          as they can be unambiguously resolved. For example, if
          add_option is called to define a --devicename option, it will
          recognize --device, --dev and so forth as long as there is no
          other option which could also match to the same abbreviation.
          Options added via AddOption do not support the automatic
          recognition of abbreviations. Instead, to allow specific
          abbreviations, include them as synonyms in the AddOption call
          itself.

          Once a new command-line option has been added with AddOption,
          the option value may be accessed using [1412]GetOption or
          [1413]env.GetOption. If the settable=True argument was supplied
          in the AddOption call, the value may also be set later using
          [1414]SetOption or [1415]env.SetOption, if conditions in an
          SConscript file require overriding any default value. Note
          however that a value specified on the command line will always
          override a value set in an SConscript file.

          Changed in 4.8.0: added the settable keyword argument to enable
          an added option to be settable via SetOption.

          Help text for an option is a combination of the string supplied
          in the help keyword argument to AddOption and information
          collected from the other keyword arguments. Such help is
          displayed if the -h command line option is used (but not with
          -H). Help for all local options is displayed under the separate
          heading Local Options. The options are unsorted - they will
          appear in the help text in the order in which the AddOption
          calls occur.

          Example:

AddOption(
    '--prefix',
    dest='prefix',
    nargs=1,
    type='string',
    action='store',
    metavar='DIR',
    help='installation prefix',
)
env = Environment(PREFIX=GetOption('prefix'))

          For that example, the following help text would be produced:

Local Options:
  --prefix=DIR                installation prefix

          Help text for local options may be unavailable if the [1416]Help
          function has been called, see the Help documentation for
          details.

Note

          As an artifact of the internal implementation, the behavior of
          options added by AddOption which take option arguments is
          undefined if whitespace (rather than an = sign) is used as the
          separator on the command line. Users should avoid such usage; it
          is recommended to add a note to this effect to project
          documentation if the situation is likely to arise. In addition,
          if the nargs keyword is used to specify more than one following
          option argument (that is, with a value of 2 or greater), such
          arguments would necessarily be whitespace separated, triggering
          the issue. Developers should not use AddOption this way. Future
          versions of SCons will likely forbid such usage.

   AddPostAction(target, action)
          env.AddPostAction(target, action)
          Arrange for the specified action to be performed after the
          specified target has been built. action may be an Action object,
          or anything that can be converted into an Action object. See the
          manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation.

          When multiple targets are supplied, the action may be called
          multiple times, once after each action that generates one or
          more targets in the list.

foo = Program('foo.c')
# remove execute permission from binary:
AddPostAction(foo, Chmod('$TARGET', "a-x"))

          If a target is an Alias, action is associated with the action of
          the alias, if specified.

   AddPreAction(target, action)
          env.AddPreAction(target, action)
          Arrange for the specified action to be performed before the
          specified target is built. action may be an Action object, or
          anything that can be converted into an Action object. See the
          manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation.

          When multiple targets are specified, the action(s) may be called
          multiple times, once before each action that generates one or
          more targets in the list.

          Note that if any of the targets are built in multiple steps, the
          action will be invoked just before the action step that
          specifically generates the specified target(s). It may not
          always be obvious if the process is multi-step - for example, if
          you use the Program builder to construct an executable program
          from a .c source file, scons builds an intermediate object file
          first; the pre-action is invoked after this step and just before
          the link command to generate the executable program binary.
          Example:

foo = Program('foo.c')
AddPreAction(foo, 'echo "Running pre-action"')

$ scons -Q
gcc -o foo.o -c foo.c
echo "Running pre-action"
Running pre-action
gcc -o foo foo.o

          If a target is an Alias, action is associated with the action of
          the alias, if specified.

   Alias(alias, [source, [action]])
          env.Alias(alias, [source, [action]])
          Create an Alias node that can be used as a reference to zero or
          more other targets, specified by the optional source parameter.
          Aliases provide a way to give a shorter or more descriptive name
          to specific targets, and to group multiple targets under a
          single name. The alias name, or an Alias Node object, may be
          used as a dependency of any other target, including another
          alias.

          alias and source may each be a string or Node object, or a list
          of strings or Node objects; if Nodes are used for alias they
          must be Alias nodes. If source is omitted, the alias is created
          but has no reference; if selected for building this will result
          in a "Nothing to be done." message. An empty alias can be used
          to define the alias in a visible place in the project; it can
          later be appended to in a subsidiary SConscript file with the
          actual target(s) to refer to. The optional action parameter
          specifies an action or list of actions that will be executed
          whenever the any of the alias targets are out-of-date.

          Alias can be called for an existing alias, which appends the
          alias and/or action arguments to the existing lists for that
          alias.

          Returns a list of Alias Node objects representing the alias(es),
          which exist outside of any physical file system. The alias name
          space is separate from the name space for tangible targets; to
          avoid confusion do not reuse target names as alias names.

          Examples:

Alias('install')
Alias('install', '/usr/bin')
Alias(['install', 'install-lib'], '/usr/local/lib')

env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/lib'])
env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/man'])

env.Alias('update', ['file1', 'file2'], "update_database $SOURCES")

   AllowSubstExceptions([exception, ...])
          Specifies the exceptions that will be ignored when expanding
          construction variables. By default, any construction variable
          expansions that generate a NameError or IndexError exception
          will expand to a '' (an empty string) and not cause scons to
          fail. All exceptions not in the specified list will generate an
          error message and terminate processing.

          If AllowSubstExceptions is called multiple times, each call
          completely overwrites the previous list of ignored exceptions.
          Calling it with no arguments means no exceptions will be
          ignored.

          Example:

# Requires that all construction variable names exist.
# (You may wish to do this if you want to enforce strictly
# that all construction variables must be defined before use.)
AllowSubstExceptions()

# Also allow a string containing a zero-division expansion
# like '${1 / 0}' to evaluate to ''.
AllowSubstExceptions(IndexError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError)

   AlwaysBuild(target, ...)
          env.AlwaysBuild(target, ...)
          Marks each given target so that it is always assumed to be
          out-of-date, and will always be rebuilt if needed. Note,
          however, that AlwaysBuild does not add its target(s) to the
          default target list, so the targets will only be built if they
          are specified on the command line, or are a dependent of a
          target specified on the command line--but they will always be
          built if so specified. Multiple targets can be passed in to a
          single call to AlwaysBuild.

   env.Append(key=val, [...])
          Appends value(s) intelligently to construction variables in env.
          The construction variables and values to add to them are passed
          as key=val pairs (Python keyword arguments). env.Append is
          designed to allow adding values without having to think about
          the data type of an existing construction variable. Regular
          Python syntax can also be used to manipulate the construction
          variable, but for that you may need to know the types involved,
          for example pure Python lets you directly "add" two lists of
          strings, but adding a string to a list or a list to a string
          requires different syntax - things Append takes care of. Some
          pre-defined construction variables do have type expectations
          based on how SCons will use them: for example [1417]$CPPDEFINES
          is often a string or a list of strings, but can also be a list
          of tuples or a dictionary; while [1418]$LIBEMITTER is expected
          to be a callable or list of callables, and [1419]$BUILDERS is
          expected to be a dictionary. Consult the documentation for the
          various construction variables for more details.

          The following descriptions apply to both the Append and Prepend
          methods, as well as their Unique variants, with the differences
          being the insertion point of the added values and whether
          duplication is allowed.

          val can be almost any type. If env does not have a construction
          variable named key, then key is simply stored with a value of
          val. Otherwise, val is combined with the existing value,
          possibly converting into an appropriate type which can hold the
          expanded contents. There are a few special cases to be aware of.
          Normally, when two strings are combined, the result is a new
          string containing their concatenation (and you are responsible
          for supplying any needed separation); however, the contents of
          [1420]$CPPDEFINES will be post-processed by adding a prefix
          and/or suffix to each entry when the command line is produced,
          so SCons keeps them separate - appending a string will result in
          a separate string entry, not a combined string. For $CPPDEFINES.
          as well as [1421]$LIBS, and the various *PATH variables, SCons
          will amend the variable by supplying the compiler-specific
          syntax (e.g. prepending a -D or /D prefix for $CPPDEFINES), so
          you should omit this syntax when adding values to these
          variables. Examples (gcc syntax shown in the expansion of
          CPPDEFINES):

env = Environment(CXXFLAGS="-std=c11", CPPDEFINES="RELEASE")
print(f"CXXFLAGS = {env['CXXFLAGS']}, CPPDEFINES = {env['CPPDEFINES']}")
# notice including a leading space in CXXFLAGS addition
env.Append(CXXFLAGS=" -O", CPPDEFINES="EXTRA")
print(f"CXXFLAGS = {env['CXXFLAGS']}, CPPDEFINES = {env['CPPDEFINES']}")
print("CPPDEFINES will expand to", env.subst('$_CPPDEFFLAGS'))

$ scons -Q
CXXFLAGS = -std=c11, CPPDEFINES = RELEASE
CXXFLAGS = -std=c11 -O, CPPDEFINES = deque(['RELEASE', 'EXTRA'])
CPPDEFINES will expand to -DRELEASE -DEXTRA
scons: `.' is up to date.

          Because [1422]$CPPDEFINES is intended for command-line
          specification of C/C++ preprocessor macros, additional syntax is
          accepted when adding to it. The preprocessor accepts arguments
          to predefine a macro name by itself (-DFOO for most compilers,
          /DFOO for Microsoft C++), which gives it an implicit value of 1,
          or can be given with a replacement value (-DBAR=TEXT). SCons
          follows these rules when adding to $CPPDEFINES:

          + A string is split on spaces, giving an easy way to enter
            multiple macros in one addition. Use an = to specify a valued
            macro.
          + A tuple is treated as a valued macro. Use the value None if
            the macro should not have a value. It is an error to supply
            more than two elements in such a tuple.
          + A list is processed in order, adding each item without further
            interpretation. In this case, space-separated strings are not
            split.
          + A dictionary is processed in order, adding each key-value pair
            as a valued macro. Use the value None if the macro should not
            have a value.

          Examples:

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES="FOO")
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES="BAR=1")
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=[("OTHER", 2)])
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES={"EXTRA": "arg"})
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
print("CPPDEFINES will expand to", env.subst('$_CPPDEFFLAGS'))

$ scons -Q
CPPDEFINES = FOO
CPPDEFINES = deque(['FOO', 'BAR=1'])
CPPDEFINES = deque(['FOO', 'BAR=1', ('OTHER', 2)])
CPPDEFINES = deque(['FOO', 'BAR=1', ('OTHER', 2), ('EXTRA', 'arg')])
CPPDEFINES will expand to -DFOO -DBAR=1 -DOTHER=2 -DEXTRA=arg
scons: `.' is up to date.

          Examples of adding multiple macros:

env = Environment()
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=[("ONE", 1), "TWO", ("THREE", )])
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES={"FOUR": 4, "FIVE": None})
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
print("CPPDEFINES will expand to", env.subst('$_CPPDEFFLAGS'))

$ scons -Q
CPPDEFINES = [('ONE', 1), 'TWO', ('THREE',)]
CPPDEFINES = deque([('ONE', 1), 'TWO', ('THREE',), ('FOUR', 4), ('FIVE', None)])
CPPDEFINES will expand to -DONE=1 -DTWO -DTHREE -DFOUR=4 -DFIVE
scons: `.' is up to date.

          Changed in version 4.5: clarified the use of tuples vs. other
          types, handling is now consistent across the four functions.

env = Environment()
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=("MACRO1", "MACRO2"))
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=[("MACRO3", "MACRO4")])
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
print("CPPDEFINES will expand to", env.subst('$_CPPDEFFLAGS'))

$ scons -Q
CPPDEFINES = ('MACRO1', 'MACRO2')
CPPDEFINES = deque(['MACRO1', 'MACRO2', ('MACRO3', 'MACRO4')])
CPPDEFINES will expand to -DMACRO1 -DMACRO2 -DMACRO3=MACRO4
scons: `.' is up to date.

          See [1423]$CPPDEFINES for more details.

          Appending a string val to a dictionary-typed construction
          variable enters val as the key in the dictionary, and None as
          its value. Using a tuple type to supply a key-value pair only
          works for the special case of $CPPDEFINES described above.

          Although most combinations of types work without needing to know
          the details, some combinations do not make sense and Python
          raises an exception.

          When using env.Append to modify construction variables which are
          path specifications (conventionally, the names of such end in
          PATH), it is recommended to add the values as a list of strings,
          even if you are only adding a single string. The same goes for
          adding library names to $LIBS.

env.Append(CPPPATH=["#/include"])

          See also [1424]env.AppendUnique, [1425]env.Prepend and
          [1426]env.PrependUnique.

   env.AppendENVPath(name, newpath, [envname, sep, delete_existing=False])
          Append directory paths from newpath to a search-path entry name
          in construction variable envname in the current enviromment
          (env). If envname is not given, the default is "ENV" (see
          [1427]$ENV). envname is expected to refer to a dictionary-like
          object; if it does not exist in env it will be created as an
          initially empty dict. newpath may be specified as a string, a
          directory node, or a list of strings. If a string, it may
          contain multiple paths separated by the system path separator
          (os.pathsep), or, if specified, by the value of sep.
          Top-relative path strings (starting with #) are recognized. The
          type of the existing value of name is preserved.

          Paths will only appear once. Duplicate paths in newpath are
          removed, preserving the last occurrence to maintain path order.
          If delete_existing is true (the default), existing duplicates
          are removed before appending, otherwise, new duplicates are
          skipped. During comparisons, paths are normalized, to avoid
          issues with case differences (on case-insensitive filesystems)
          and with relative paths that may refer back to the same
          directory. The stored values are not modified by this process.

          Example:

print('before:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.AppendENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print('after:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])

          Yields:

before: /foo:/biz
after: /biz:/foo/bar:/foo

          See also [1428]env.PrependENVPath.

   env.AppendUnique(key=val, [...], [delete_existing=False])
          Append values to construction variables in the current
          construction environment, maintaining uniqueness. Works like
          [1429]env.Append, except that values that would become
          duplicates are not added. If delete_existing is set to a true
          value, then for any duplicate, the existing instance of val is
          first removed, then val is appended, having the effect of moving
          it to the end.

          Example:

env.AppendUnique(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

          See also [1430]env.Append, [1431]env.Prepend and
          [1432]env.PrependUnique.

   Builder(action, [arguments])
          env.Builder(action, [arguments])
          Creates a Builder object for the specified action. See the
          manpage section "Builder Objects" for a complete explanation of
          the arguments and behavior.

          Note that the env.Builder() form of the invocation will expand
          construction variables in any arguments strings, including the
          action argument, at the time it is called using the construction
          variables in the env construction environment through which
          env.Builder was called. The Builder form delays all variable
          expansion until after the Builder object is actually called.

   CacheDir(cache_dir, custom_class=None)
          env.CacheDir(cache_dir, custom_class=None)
          Direct scons to maintain a derived-file cache in cache_dir. The
          derived files in the cache will be shared among all the builds
          specifying the same cache_dir. Specifying a cache_dir of None
          disables derived file caching.

          Calling the environment method [1433]env.CacheDir limits the
          effect to targets built through the specified construction
          environment. Calling the global function [1434]CacheDir sets a
          global default that will be used by all targets built through
          construction environments that do not set up
          environment-specific caching by calling env.CacheDir.

          Caching behavior can be configured by passing a specialized
          cache class as the optional custom_class parameter. This class
          must be a subclass of SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir. SCons will
          internally invoke the custom class for performing caching
          operations. If the parameter is omitted or set to None, SCons
          will use the default SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir class.

          When derived-file caching is being used and scons finds a
          derived file that needs to be rebuilt, it will first look in the
          cache to see if a file with matching build signature exists
          (indicating the input file(s) and build action(s) were identical
          to those for the current target), and if so, will retrieve the
          file from the cache. scons will report Retrieved `file' from
          cache instead of the normal build message. If the derived file
          is not present in the cache, scons will build it and then place
          a copy of the built file in the cache, identified by its build
          signature, for future use.

          The Retrieved `file' from cache messages are useful for human
          consumption, but less useful when comparing log files between
          scons runs which will show differences that are noisy and not
          actually significant. To disable, use the --cache-show option.
          With this option, scons changes printing to always show the
          action that would have been used to build the file without
          caching.

          Derived-file caching may be disabled for any invocation of scons
          by giving the --cache-disable command line option; cache
          updating may be disabled, leaving cache fetching enabled, by
          giving the --cache-readonly option.

          If the --cache-force option is used, scons will place a copy of
          all derived files into the cache, even if they already existed
          and were not built by this invocation. This is useful to
          populate a cache the first time a cache_dir is used for a build,
          or to bring a cache up to date after a build with cache updating
          disabled (--cache-disable or --cache-readonly) has been done.

          The [1435]NoCache method can be used to disable caching of
          specific files. This can be useful if inputs and/or outputs of
          some tool are impossible to predict or prohibitively large.

          Note that (at this time) SCons provides no facilities for
          managing the derived-file cache. It is up to the developer to
          arrange for cache pruning, expiry, access control, etc. if
          needed.

   Clean(targets, files)
          env.Clean(targets, files)
          Set additional files for removal when any of targets are
          selected for cleaning ([1436]-c command line option). targets
          and files can each be a single filename or node, or a list of
          filenames or nodes. These can refer to files or directories.
          Calling this method repeatedly has an additive effect.

          The related [1437]NoClean method has higher priority: any target
          specified to NoClean will not be cleaned even if also given as a
          files parameter to Clean.

          Examples:

Clean('foo', ['bar', 'baz'])
Clean('dist', env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))
Clean(['foo', 'bar'], 'something_else_to_clean')

          SCons does not directly track directories as targets - they are
          created if needed and not normally removed in clean mode. In
          this example, installing the project creates a subdirectory for
          the documentation. The Clean call ensures that the subdirectory
          is removed if the project is uninstalled.

Clean(docdir, os.path.join(docdir, projectname))

   env.Clone([key=val, ...])
          Returns an independent copy of a construction environment. If
          there are any unrecognized keyword arguments specified, they are
          added as construction variables in the copy, overwriting any
          existing values for those keywords. See the manpage section
          "Construction Environments" for more details.

          Example:

env2 = env.Clone()
env3 = env.Clone(CCFLAGS='-g')

          A list of tools and a toolpath may be specified, as in the
          [1438]Environment constructor:

def MyTool(env):
    env['FOO'] = 'bar'

env4 = env.Clone(tools=['msvc', MyTool])

          The parse_flags keyword argument is also recognized, to allow
          merging command-line style arguments into the appropriate
          construction variables (see [1439]env.MergeFlags).

# create an environment for compiling programs that use wxWidgets
wx_env = env.Clone(parse_flags='!wx-config --cflags --cxxflags')

          The variables keyword argument is also recognized, to allow
          (re)initializing construction variables from a Variables object.

          Changed in version 4.8.0: the variables parameter was added.

   Command(target, source, action, [key=val, ...])
          env.Command(target, source, action, [key=val, ...])
          Creates an anonymous builder and calls it, thus recording action
          to build target from source into the dependency tree. This can
          be more convenient for a single special-case build than having
          to define and add a new named Builder.

          The Command function accepts the source_scanner and
          target_scanner keyword arguments which are used to specify
          custom scanners for the specified sources or targets. The value
          must be a Scanner object. For example, the global DirScanner
          object can be used if any of the sources will be directories
          that must be scanned on-disk for changes to files that aren't
          already specified in other Builder or function calls.

          The Command function also accepts the source_factory and
          target_factory keyword arguments which are used to specify
          factory functions to create SCons Nodes from any sources or
          targets specified as strings. If any sources or targets are
          already Node objects, they are not further transformed even if a
          factory is specified for them. The default for each is the Entry
          factory.

          These four arguments, if given, are used in the creation of the
          Builder. Other Builder-specific keyword arguments are not
          recognized as such. See the manpage section "Builder Objects"
          for more information about how these arguments work in a
          Builder.

          Any remaining keyword arguments are passed on to the generated
          builder when it is called, and behave as described in the
          manpage section "Builder Methods", in short: recognized
          arguments have their specified meanings, while the rest are used
          to override any same-named existing construction variables from
          the construction environment.

          action can be an external command, specified as a string, or a
          callable Python object; see the manpage section "Action Objects"
          for more complete information. Also note that a string
          specifying an external command may be preceded by an at-sign (@)
          to suppress printing the command in question, or by a hyphen (-)
          to ignore the exit status of the external command.

          Examples:

env.Command(
    target='foo.out',
    source='foo.in',
    action="$FOO_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET"
)

env.Command(
    target='bar.out',
    source='bar.in',
    action=["rm -f $TARGET", "$BAR_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET"],
    ENV={'PATH': '/usr/local/bin/'},
)


import os
def rename(env, target, source):
    os.rename('.tmp', target[0])


env.Command(
    target='baz.out',
    source='baz.in',
    action=["$BAZ_BUILD < $SOURCES > .tmp", rename],
)

          Note that the Command function will usually assume, by default,
          that the specified targets and/or sources are Files, if no other
          part of the configuration identifies what type of entries they
          are. If necessary, you can explicitly specify that targets or
          source nodes should be treated as directories by using the
          [1440]Dir or [1441]env.Dir functions.

          Examples:

env.Command('ddd.list', Dir('ddd'), 'ls -l $SOURCE > $TARGET')

env['DISTDIR'] = 'destination/directory'
env.Command(env.Dir('$DISTDIR')), None, make_distdir)

          Also note that SCons will usually automatically create any
          directory necessary to hold a target file, so you normally don't
          need to create directories by hand.

   Configure(env, [custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h])
          env.Configure([custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h])
          Creates a Configure object for integrated functionality similar
          to GNU autoconf. See the manpage section "Configure Contexts"
          for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

   DebugOptions([json])
          Allows setting options for SCons debug options. Currently, the
          only supported value is json which sets the path to the JSON
          file created when --debug=json is set.

DebugOptions(json='#/build/output/scons_stats.json')

          New in version 4.6.0.

   Decider(function)
          env.Decider(function)
          Specifies that all up-to-date decisions for targets built
          through this construction environment will be handled by
          function. function can be the name of a function or one of the
          following strings that specify a predefined decider function:

        "content"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out-of-date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's content has changed since
                the last time the target was built, as determined by
                performing a checksum on the dependency's contents using
                the selected hash function, and comparing it to the
                checksum recorded the last time the target was built.
                content is the default decider.

                Changed in version 4.1: The decider was renamed to content
                since the hash function is now selectable. The former
                name, MD5, can still be used as a synonym, but is
                deprecated.

        "content-timestamp"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out-of-date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's content has changed since
                the last time the target was built, except that
                dependencies with a timestamp that matches the last time
                the target was rebuilt will be assumed to be up-to-date
                and not rebuilt. This provides behavior very similar to
                the content behavior of always checksumming file contents,
                with an optimization of not checking the contents of files
                whose timestamps haven't changed. The drawback is that
                SCons will not detect if a file's content has changed but
                its timestamp is the same, as might happen in an automated
                script that runs a build, updates a file, and runs the
                build again, all within a single second.

                Changed in version 4.1: The decider was renamed to
                content-timestamp since the hash function is now
                selectable. The former name, MD5-timestamp, can still be
                used as a synonym, but is deprecated.

        "timestamp-newer"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out-of-date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp is newer than
                the target file's timestamp. This is the behavior of the
                classic Make utility, and make can be used a synonym for
                timestamp-newer.

        "timestamp-match"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out-of-date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp is different
                than the timestamp recorded the last time the target was
                built. This provides behavior very similar to the classic
                Make utility (in particular, files are not opened up so
                that their contents can be checksummed) except that the
                target will also be rebuilt if a dependency file has been
                restored to a version with an earlier timestamp, such as
                can happen when restoring files from backup archives.

          Examples:

# Use exact timestamp matches by default.
Decider('timestamp-match')

# Use hash content signatures for any targets built
# with the attached construction environment.
env.Decider('content')

          In addition to the above already-available functions, the
          function argument may be a Python function you supply. Such a
          function must accept the following four arguments:

        dependency
                The Node (file) which should cause the target to be
                rebuilt if it has "changed" since the last time target was
                built.

        target
                The Node (file) being built. In the normal case, this is
                what should get rebuilt if the dependency has "changed."

        prev_ni
                Stored information about the state of the dependency the
                last time the target was built. This can be consulted to
                match various file characteristics such as the timestamp,
                size, or content signature.

        repo_node
                If set, use this Node instead of the one specified by
                dependency to determine if the dependency has changed.
                This argument is optional so should be written as a
                default argument (typically it would be written as
                repo_node=None). A caller will normally only set this if
                the target only exists in a Repository.

          The function should return a value which evaluates True if the
          dependency has "changed" since the last time the target was
          built (indicating that the target should be rebuilt), and a
          value which evaluates False otherwise (indicating that the
          target should not be rebuilt). Note that the decision can be
          made using whatever criteria are appropriate. Ignoring some or
          all of the function arguments is perfectly normal.

          Example:

def my_decider(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
    return not os.path.exists(str(target))

env.Decider(my_decider)

   Default(target[, ...])
          env.Default(target[, ...])
          Specify default targets to the SCons target selection mechanism.
          Any call to Default will cause SCons to use the defined default
          target list instead of its built-in algorithm for determining
          default targets (see the manpage section "Target Selection").

          target may be one or more strings, a list of strings, a NodeList
          as returned by a Builder, or None. A string target may be the
          name of a file or directory, or a target previously defined by a
          call to [1442]Alias (defining the alias later will still create
          the alias, but it will not be recognized as a default). Calls to
          Default are additive. A target of None will clear any existing
          default target list; subsequent calls to Default will add to the
          (now empty) default target list like normal.

          Both forms of this call affect the same global list of default
          targets; the construction environment method applies
          construction variable expansion to the targets.

          The current list of targets added using Default is available in
          the DEFAULT_TARGETS list (see below).

          Examples:

Default('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
env.Default(['a', 'b', 'c'])
hello = env.Program('hello', 'hello.c')
env.Default(hello)

   DefaultEnvironment([key=value, ...])
          Instantiates and returns the global construction environment
          object. The Default Environment is used internally by SCons when
          executing a global function or the global form of a Builder
          method that requires access to a construction environment.

          On the first call, arguments are interpreted as for the
          [1443]Environment function. The Default Environment is a
          singleton; subsequent calls to DefaultEnvironment return the
          already-constructed object, and any keyword arguments are
          silently ignored.

          The Default Environment can be modified after instantiation,
          similar to other construction environments, although some
          construction environment methods may be unavailable. Modifying
          the Default Environment has no effect on any other construction
          environment, either existing or newly constructed.

          It is not necessary to explicitly call DefaultEnvironment. SCons
          instantiates the default environment automatically when the
          build phase begins, if has not already been done. However,
          calling it explicitly provides the opportunity to affect and
          examine its contents. Instantiation occurs even if nothing in
          the build system appears to use it, due to internal uses.

          If the project SConscript files do not use global functions or
          Builders, a small performance gain may be achieved by calling
          DefaultEnvironment with an empty tools list
          (DefaultEnvironment(tools=[])). This avoids the tool
          initialization cost for the Default Environment, which is mainly
          of interest in the test suite where scons is launched repeatedly
          in a short time period.

   Depends(target, dependency)
          env.Depends(target, dependency)
          Specifies an explicit dependency; the target will be rebuilt
          whenever the dependency has changed. Both the specified target
          and dependency can be a string (usually the path name of a file
          or directory) or Node objects, or a list of strings or Node
          objects (such as returned by a Builder call). This should only
          be necessary for cases where the dependency is not caught by a
          Scanner for the file.

          Example:

env.Depends('foo', 'other-input-file-for-foo')

mylib = env.Library('mylib.c')
installed_lib = env.Install('lib', mylib)
bar = env.Program('bar.c')

# Arrange for the library to be copied into the installation
# directory before trying to build the "bar" program.
# (Note that this is for example only.  A "real" library
# dependency would normally be configured through the $LIBS
# and $LIBPATH variables, not using an env.Depends() call.)

env.Depends(bar, installed_lib)

   env.Detect(progs)
          Find an executable from one or more choices: progs may be a
          string or a list of strings. Returns the first value from progs
          that was found, or None. Executable is searched by checking the
          paths in the execution environment (env['ENV']['PATH']). On
          Windows systems, additionally applies the filename suffixes
          found in the execution environment (env['ENV']['PATHEXT']) but
          will not include any such extension in the return value.
          env.Detect is a wrapper around [1444]env.WhereIs.

   env.Dictionary([var, ...], [as_dict=])
          Return an object containing construction variables from env. If
          var is omitted, all the construction variables with their values
          are returned in a dict. If var is specified, and as_dict is
          true, the specified construction variables are returned in a
          dict; otherwise (the default, for backwards compatibility),
          values only are returned, as a scalar if one var is given, or as
          a list if multiples.

          Example:

cvars = env.Dictionary()
cc_values = env.Dictionary('CC', 'CCFLAGS', 'CCCOM')

Note

          The object returned by [1445]env.Dictionary should be treated as
          a read-only view into the construction variables. Some
          construction variables require special internal handling, and
          modifying them through the env.Dictionary object can bypass that
          handling and cause data inconsistencies. The primary use of
          env.Dictionary is for diagnostic purposes - it is used widely by
          test cases specifically because it bypasses the special handling
          so that behavior can be verified.

          Changed in 4.9.0: as_dict added.

   Dir(name, [directory])
          env.Dir(name, [directory])
          Returns Directory Node(s). A Directory Node is an object that
          represents a directory. name can be a relative or absolute path
          or a list of such paths. directory is an optional directory that
          will be used as the parent directory. If no directory is
          specified, the current script's directory is used as the parent.

          If name is a single pathname, the corresponding node is
          returned. If name is a list, SCons returns a list of nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in name.

          Directory Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string
          as a directory name to a Builder method or function. Directory
          Nodes have attributes and methods that are useful in many
          situations; see manpage section "Filesystem Nodes" for more
          information.

   env.Dump([var, ...], [format=TYPE])
          Serialize construction variables from env to a string. If var is
          omitted, all the construction variables are serialized. If one
          or more var values are supplied, only those variables and their
          values are serialized.

          The optional format string selects the serialization format:

        pretty
                Returns a pretty-printed representation of the
                construction variables - the result will look like a
                Python dict (this is the default).

        json
                Returns a JSON-formatted representation of the variables.
                The variables will be presented as a JSON object literal,
                the JSON equivalent of a Python dict..

          Changed in 4.9.0: More than one key can be specified. The
          returned string always looks like a dict (or equivalent in other
          formats); previously a single key serialized only the value, not
          the key with the value.

          Examples: this SConstruct

env = Environment()
print(env.Dump('CCCOM'))
print(env.Dump('CC', 'CCFLAGS', format='json'))

          will print something like:

{'CCCOM': '$CC -o $TARGET -c $CFLAGS $CCFLAGS $_CCCOMCOM $SOURCES'}
{
    "CC": "gcc",
    "CCFLAGS": []
}

          While this SConstruct:

env = Environment()
print(env.Dump())

          will print something like:

{ 'AR': 'ar',
  'ARCOM': '$AR $ARFLAGS $TARGET $SOURCES\n$RANLIB $RANLIBFLAGS $TARGET',
  'ARFLAGS': ['r'],
  'AS': 'as',
  'ASCOM': '$AS $ASFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCES',
  'ASFLAGS': [],
  ...

   EnsurePythonVersion(major, minor)
          Ensure that the Python version is at least major.minor. This
          function will print out an error message and exit SCons with a
          non-zero exit code if the actual Python version is not late
          enough.

          Example:

EnsurePythonVersion(2,2)

   EnsureSConsVersion(major, minor, [revision])
          Ensure that the SCons version is at least major.minor, or
          major.minor.revision. if revision is specified. This function
          will print out an error message and exit SCons with a non-zero
          exit code if the actual SCons version is not late enough.

          Examples:

EnsureSConsVersion(0,14)

EnsureSConsVersion(0,96,90)

   Environment([key=value, ...])
          env.Environment([key=value, ...])
          Return a new construction environment initialized with the
          specified key=value pairs. The keyword arguments parse_flags,
          platform, toolpath, tools and variables are specially recognized
          and do not lead to construction variable creation. See the
          manpage section "Construction Environments" for more details.

   Execute(action, [actionargs ...])
          env.Execute(action, [actionargs ...])
          Executes an Action. action may be an Action object or it may be
          a command-line string, list of commands, or executable Python
          function, each of which will first be converted into an Action
          object and then executed. Any additional arguments to Execute
          are passed on to the [1446]Action factory function which
          actually creates the Action object (see the manpage section
          [1447]Action Objects for a description). Example:

Execute(Copy('file.out', 'file.in'))

          Execute performs its action immediately, as part of the
          SConscript-reading phase. There are no sources or targets
          declared in an Execute call, so any objects it manipulates will
          not be tracked as part of the SCons dependency graph. In the
          example above, neither file.out nor file.in will be tracked
          objects.

          Execute returns the exit value of the command or return value of
          the Python function. scons prints an error message if the
          executed action fails (exits with or returns a non-zero value),
          however it does not, automatically terminate the build for such
          a failure. If you want the build to stop in response to a failed
          Execute call, you must explicitly check for a non-zero return
          value:

if Execute("mkdir sub/dir/ectory"):
    # The mkdir failed, don't try to build.
    Exit(1)

   Exit([value])
          This tells scons to exit immediately with the specified value. A
          default exit value of 0 (zero) is used if no value is specified.

   Export([vars...], [key=value...])
          env.Export([vars...], [key=value...])
          Exports variables for sharing with other SConscript files. The
          variables are added to a global collection where they can be
          imported by other SConscript files. vars may be one or more
          strings, or a list of strings. If any string contains
          whitespace, it is split automatically into individual strings.
          Each string must match the name of a variable that is in scope
          during evaluation of the current SConscript file, or an
          exception is raised.

          A vars argument may also be a dictionary or individual keyword
          arguments; in accordance with Python syntax rules, keyword
          arguments must come after any non-keyword arguments. The
          dictionary/keyword form can be used to map the local name of a
          variable to a different name to be used for imports. See the
          Examples for an illustration of the syntax.

          Export calls are cumulative. Specifying a previously exported
          variable will replace the previous value in the collection. Both
          local variables and global variables can be exported.

          To use an exported variable, an SConscript must call
          [1448]Import to bring it into its own scope. Importing creates
          an additional reference to the object that was originally
          exported, so if that object is mutable, changes made will be
          visible to other users of that object.

          Examples:

env = Environment()
# Make env available for all SConscript files to Import().
Export("env")

package = 'my_name'
# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:.
Export("env", "package")

# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:
Export(["env", "package"])

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export(debug=env)

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export({"debug": env})

          Note that the [1449]SConscript function also supports an exports
          argument that allows exporting one or more variables to the
          SConscript files invoked by that call (only). See the
          description of that function for details.

   File(name, [directory])
          env.File(name, [directory])
          Returns File Node(s). A File Node is an object that represents a
          file. name can be a relative or absolute path or a list of such
          paths. directory is an optional directory that will be used as
          the parent directory. If no directory is specified, the current
          script's directory is used as the parent.

          If name is a single pathname, the corresponding node is
          returned. If name is a list, SCons returns a list of nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in name.

          File Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string as a
          file name to a Builder method or function. File Nodes have
          attributes and methods that are useful in many situations; see
          manpage section "Filesystem Nodes" for more information.

   FindFile(file, dirs)
          env.FindFile(file, dirs)
          Search for file in the path specified by dirs. dirs may be a
          list of directory names or a single directory name. In addition
          to searching for files that exist in the filesystem, this
          function also searches for derived files that have not yet been
          built.

          Example:

foo = env.FindFile('foo', ['dir1', 'dir2'])

   FindInstalledFiles()
          env.FindInstalledFiles()
          Returns the list of targets set up by the [1450]Install or
          [1451]InstallAs builders.

          This function serves as a convenient method to select the
          contents of a binary package.

          Example:

Install('/bin', ['executable_a', 'executable_b'])

# will return the file node list
# ['/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b']
FindInstalledFiles()

Install('/lib', ['some_library'])

# will return the file node list
# ['/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b', '/lib/some_library']
FindInstalledFiles()

   FindPathDirs(variable)
          Returns a function (actually a callable Python object) intended
          to be used as the path_function of a Scanner object. The
          returned object will look up the specified variable in a
          construction environment and treat the construction variable's
          value as a list of directory paths that should be searched (like
          [1452]$CPPPATH, [1453]$LIBPATH, etc.).

          Note that use of FindPathDirs is generally preferable to writing
          your own path_function for the following reasons: 1) The
          returned list will contain all appropriate directories found in
          source trees (when [1454]VariantDir is used) or in code
          repositories (when Repository or the -Y option are used). 2)
          scons will identify expansions of variable that evaluate to the
          same list of directories as, in fact, the same list, and avoid
          re-scanning the directories for files, when possible.

          Example:

def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    # Code to scan file contents goes here...
    return include_files

scanner = Scanner(name = 'myscanner',
                  function = my_scan,
                  path_function = FindPathDirs('MYPATH'))

   FindSourceFiles(node='"."')
          env.FindSourceFiles(node='"."')
          Returns the list of nodes which serve as the source of the built
          files. It does so by inspecting the dependency tree starting at
          the optional argument node which defaults to the '"."'-node. It
          will then return all leaves of node. These are all children
          which have no further children.

          This function is a convenient method to select the contents of a
          Source Package.

          Example:

Program('src/main_a.c')
Program('src/main_b.c')
Program('main_c.c')

# returns ['main_c.c', 'src/main_a.c', 'SConstruct', 'src/main_b.c']
FindSourceFiles()

# returns ['src/main_b.c', 'src/main_a.c' ]
FindSourceFiles('src')

          As you can see, build support files (SConstruct in the above
          example) will also be returned by this function.

   Flatten(sequence)
          env.Flatten(sequence)
          Takes a sequence (that is, a Python list or tuple) that may
          contain nested sequences and returns a flattened list containing
          all of the individual elements in any sequence. This can be
          helpful for collecting the lists returned by calls to Builders;
          other Builders will automatically flatten lists specified as
          input, but direct Python manipulation of these lists does not.

          Examples:

foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')

# Because `foo' and `bar' are lists returned by the Object() Builder,
# `objects' will be a list containing nested lists:
objects = ['f1.o', foo, 'f2.o', bar, 'f3.o']

# Passing such a list to another Builder is all right because
# the Builder will flatten the list automatically:
Program(source = objects)

# If you need to manipulate the list directly using Python, you need to
# call Flatten() yourself, or otherwise handle nested lists:
for object in Flatten(objects):
    print(str(object))

   GetBuildFailures()
          Returns a list of exceptions for the actions that failed while
          attempting to build targets. Each element in the returned list
          is a BuildError object with the following attributes that record
          various aspects of the build failure:

          .node The node that was being built when the build failure
          occurred.

          .status The numeric exit status returned by the command or
          Python function that failed when trying to build the specified
          Node.

          .errstr The SCons error string describing the build failure.
          (This is often a generic message like "Error 2" to indicate that
          an executed command exited with a status of 2.)

          .filename The name of the file or directory that actually caused
          the failure. This may be different from the .node attribute. For
          example, if an attempt to build a target named sub/dir/target
          fails because the sub/dir directory could not be created, then
          the .node attribute will be sub/dir/target but the .filename
          attribute will be sub/dir.

          .executor The SCons Executor object for the target Node being
          built. This can be used to retrieve the construction environment
          used for the failed action.

          .action The actual SCons Action object that failed. This will be
          one specific action out of the possible list of actions that
          would have been executed to build the target.

          .command The actual expanded command that was executed and
          failed, after expansion of [1455]$TARGET, [1456]$SOURCE, and
          other construction variables.

          Note that the GetBuildFailures function will always return an
          empty list until any build failure has occurred, which means
          that GetBuildFailures will always return an empty list while the
          SConscript files are being read. Its primary intended use is for
          functions that will be executed before SCons exits by passing
          them to the standard Python atexit.register() function. Example:

import atexit

def print_build_failures():
    from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
    for bf in GetBuildFailures():
        print("%s failed: %s" % (bf.node, bf.errstr))

atexit.register(print_build_failures)

   GetBuildPath(file, [...])
          env.GetBuildPath(file, [...])
          Returns the scons path name (or names) for the specified file
          (or files). The specified file or files may be scons Nodes or
          strings representing path names.

   GetLaunchDir()
          Returns the absolute path name of the directory from which scons
          was initially invoked. This can be useful when using the -u, -U
          or -D options, which internally change to the directory in which
          the SConstruct file is found.

   GetOption(name)
          env.GetOption(name)
          Query the value of settable options which may have been set on
          the command line, via option defaults, or by using the
          [1457]SetOption function. The value of the option is returned in
          a type matching how the option was declared - see the
          documentation of the corresponding command line option for
          information about each specific option.

          name can be an entry from the following table, which shows the
          corresponding command line arguments that could affect the
          value. name can be also be the destination variable name from a
          project-specific option added using the [1458]AddOption
          function, as long as that addition has been processed prior to
          the GetOption call in the SConscript files.

   GetSConsVersion()
          Returns the current SCons version in the form of a Tuple[int,
          int, int], representing the major, minor, and revision values
          respectively. Added in 4.8.0.

   Glob(pattern, [ondisk=True, source=False, strings=False, exclude=None])
          env.Glob(pattern, [ondisk=True, source=False, strings=False,
          exclude=None])
          Returns a possibly empty list of Nodes (or strings) that match
          pathname specification pattern. pattern can be absolute,
          top-relative, or (most commonly) relative to the directory of
          the current SConscript file. Glob matches both files stored on
          disk and Nodes which SCons already knows about, even if any
          corresponding file is not currently stored on disk. The
          environment method form (env.Glob) performs string substitution
          on pattern and returns whatever matches the resulting expanded
          pattern. The results are sorted, unlike for the similar Python
          glob.glob function, to ensure build order will be stable.

          pattern can contain POSIX-style shell metacharacters for
          matching:

          Pattern                         Meaning
          *       matches everything
          ?       matches any single character
          [seq]   matches any character in seq (can be a list or a range).
          [!seq]  matches any character not in seq

          For a literal match, wrap the metacharacter in brackets to
          escape the normal behavior. For example, '[?]' matches the
          character '?'.

          Filenames starting with a dot are specially handled - they can
          only be matched by patterns that start with a dot (or have a dot
          immediately following a pathname separator character, or slash),
          they are not not matched by the metacharacters. Metacharacter
          matches also do not span directory separators.

          Glob understands repositories (see the [1461]Repository
          function) and source directories (see the [1462]VariantDir
          function) and returns a Node (or string, if so configured) match
          in the local (SConscript) directory if a matching Node is found
          anywhere in a corresponding repository or source directory.

          If the optional ondisk argument evaluates false, the search for
          matches on disk is disabled, and only matches from
          already-configured File or Dir Nodes are returned. The default
          is to return Nodes for matches on disk as well.

          If the optional source argument evaluates true, and the local
          directory is a variant directory, then Glob returns Nodes from
          the corresponding source directory, rather than the local
          directory.

          If the optional strings argument evaluates true, Glob returns
          matches as strings, rather than Nodes. The returned strings will
          be relative to the local (SConscript) directory. (Note that
          while this may make it easier to perform arbitrary manipulation
          of file names, it loses the context SCons would have in the
          Node, so if the returned strings are passed to a different
          SConscript file, any Node translation there will be relative to
          that SConscript directory, not to the original SConscript
          directory.)

          The optional exclude argument may be set to a pattern or a list
          of patterns describing files or directories to filter out of the
          match list. Elements matching a least one specified pattern will
          be excluded. These patterns use the same syntax as for pattern.

          Examples:

Program("foo", Glob("*.c"))
Zip("/tmp/everything", Glob(".??*") + Glob("*"))
sources = Glob("*.cpp", exclude=["os_*_specific_*.cpp"]) \
    + Glob("os_%s_specific_*.cpp" % currentOS)

   Help(text, append=False, local_only=False)
          env.Help(text, append=False, local_only=False)
          Adds text to the help message shown when scons is called with
          the -h or --help argument.

          On the first call to Help, if append is False (the default), any
          existing help text is discarded. The default help text is the
          help for the scons command itself plus help collected from any
          project-local [1463]AddOption calls. This is the help printed if
          Help has never been called. If append is True, text is appended
          to the existing help text. If local_only is also True (the
          default is False), the project-local help from AddOption calls
          is preserved in the help message but the scons command help is
          not.

          Subsequent calls to Help ignore the keyword arguments append and
          local_only and always append to the existing help text.

          Changed in 4.6.0: added local_only.

   Ignore(target, dependency)
          env.Ignore(target, dependency)
          Ignores dependency when deciding if target needs to be rebuilt.
          target and dependency can each be a single filename or Node or a
          list of filenames or Nodes.

          Ignore can also be used to remove a target from the default
          build by specifying the directory the target will be built in as
          target and the file you want to skip selecting for building as
          dependency. Note that this only removes the target from the
          default target selection algorithm: if it is a dependency of
          another object being built SCons still builds it normally. See
          the third and forth examples below.

          Examples:

env.Ignore('foo', 'foo.c')
env.Ignore('bar', ['bar1.h', 'bar2.h'])
env.Ignore('.', 'foobar.obj')
env.Ignore('bar', 'bar/foobar.obj')

   Import(vars...)
          env.Import(vars...)
          Imports variables into the scope of the current SConscript file.
          vars must be strings representing names of variables which have
          been previously exported either by the [1464]Export function or
          by the exports argument to the [1465]SConscript function.
          Variables exported by the SConscript call take precedence.
          Multiple variable names can be passed to Import as separate
          arguments, as a list of strings, or as words in a
          space-separated string. The wildcard "*" can be used to import
          all available variables.

          If the imported variable is mutable, changes made locally will
          be reflected in the object the variable is bound to. This allows
          subsidiary SConscript files to contribute to building up, for
          example, a construction environment.

          Examples:

Import("env")
Import("env", "variable")
Import(["env", "variable"])
Import("*")

   Literal(string)
          env.Literal(string)
          The specified string will be preserved as-is and not have
          construction variables expanded.

   Local(targets)
          env.Local(targets)
          The specified targets will have copies made in the local tree,
          even if an already up-to-date copy exists in a repository.
          Returns a list of the target Node or Nodes.

   env.MergeFlags(arg, [unique])
          Merges values from arg into construction variables in env. If
          arg is a dictionary, each key-value pair represents a
          construction variable name and the corresponding flags to merge.
          If arg is not a dictionary, MergeFlags attempts to convert it to
          one before the values are merged. [1466]env.ParseFlags is used
          for this, so values to be converted are subject to the same
          limitations: ParseFlags has knowledge of which construction
          variables certain flags should go to, but not all; and only for
          GCC and compatible compiler chains. arg must be a single object,
          so to pass multiple strings, enclose them in a list.

          If unique is true (the default), duplicate values are not
          retained. In case of duplication, any construction variable
          names that end in PATH keep the left-most value so the path
          search order is not altered. All other construction variables
          keep the right-most value. If unique is false, values are
          appended even if they are duplicates.

          Examples:

# Add an optimization flag to $CCFLAGS.
env.MergeFlags({'CCFLAGS': '-O3'})

# Combine the flags returned from running pkg-config with an optimization
# flag and merge the result into the construction variables.
env.MergeFlags(['!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags', '-O3'])

# Combine an optimization flag with the flags returned from running pkg-config
# for two distinct packages and merge into the construction variables.
env.MergeFlags(
    [
        '-O3',
        '!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags --libs',
        '!pkg-config libpng12 --cflags --libs',
    ]
)

   NoCache(target, ...)
          env.NoCache(target, ...)
          Specifies a list of files which should not be cached whenever
          the [1467]CacheDir method has been activated. The specified
          targets may be a list or an individual target.

          Multiple files should be specified either as separate arguments
          to the NoCache method, or as a list. NoCache will also accept
          the return value of any of the construction environment Builder
          methods.

          Calling NoCache on directories and other non-File Node types has
          no effect because only File Nodes are cached.

          Examples:

NoCache('foo.elf')
NoCache(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

   NoClean(targets, ...)
          env.NoClean(targets, ...)
          Specifies files or directories which should not be removed
          whenever a specified target (or its dependencies) is selected
          and clean mode is active ([1468]-c command line option). targets
          may be one or more file or directory names or nodes, and/or
          lists of names or nodes. NoClean can be called multiple times.

          Calling NoClean for a target overrides calling [1469]Clean for
          the same target, so any targets passed to both functions will
          not be removed in clean mode.

          Examples:

NoClean('foo.elf')
NoClean(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

   env.ParseConfig(command, [function, unique])
          Updates the current construction environment with the values
          extracted from the output of running external command, by
          passing it to a helper function. command may be a string or a
          list of strings representing the command and its arguments. If
          function is omitted or None, [1470]env.MergeFlags is used. By
          default, duplicate values are not added to any construction
          variables; you can specify unique=False to allow duplicate
          values to be added.

          command is executed using the SCons execution environment (that
          is, the construction variable [1471]$ENV in the current
          construction environment). If command needs additional
          information to operate properly, that needs to be set in the
          execution environment. For example, pkg-config may need a custom
          value set in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.

          env.MergeFlags needs to understand the output produced by
          command in order to distribute it to appropriate construction
          variables. env.MergeFlags uses a separate function to do that
          processing - see [1472]env.ParseFlags for the details, including
          a table of options and corresponding construction variables. To
          provide alternative processing of the output of command, you can
          supply a custom function, which must accept three arguments: the
          construction environment to modify, a string argument containing
          the output from running command, and the optional unique flag.

   ParseDepends(filename, [must_exist, only_one])
          env.ParseDepends(filename, [must_exist, only_one])
          Parses the contents of filename as a list of dependencies in the
          style of Make or mkdep, and explicitly establishes all of the
          listed dependencies.

          By default, it is not an error if filename does not exist. The
          optional must_exist argument may be set to True to have SCons
          raise an exception if the file does not exist, or is otherwise
          inaccessible.

          The optional only_one argument may be set to True to have SCons
          raise an exception if the file contains dependency information
          for more than one target. This can provide a small sanity check
          for files intended to be generated by, for example, the gcc -M
          flag, which should typically only write dependency information
          for one output file into a corresponding .d file.

          filename and all of the files listed therein will be interpreted
          relative to the directory of the SConscript file which calls the
          ParseDepends function.

   env.ParseFlags(flags, ...)
          Parses one or more strings containing typical command-line flags
          for GCC-style tool chains and returns a dictionary with the flag
          values separated into the appropriate SCons construction
          variables. Intended as a companion to the [1473]env.MergeFlags
          method, but allows for the values in the returned dictionary to
          be modified, if necessary, before merging them into the
          construction environment. (Note that env.MergeFlags will call
          this method if its argument is not a dictionary, so it is
          usually not necessary to call env.ParseFlags directly unless you
          want to manipulate the values.)

          If the first character in any string is an exclamation mark (!),
          the rest of the string is executed as a command, and the output
          from the command is parsed as GCC tool chain command-line flags
          and added to the resulting dictionary. This can be used to call
          a *-config command typical of the POSIX programming environment
          (for example, pkg-config). Note that such a command is executed
          using the SCons execution environment; if the command needs
          additional information, that information needs to be explicitly
          provided. See [1474]ParseConfig for more details.

          Flag values are translated according to the prefix found, and
          added to the following construction variables:

-arch                   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-D                      CPPDEFINES
-framework              FRAMEWORKS
-frameworkdir=          FRAMEWORKPATH
-fmerge-all-constants   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-fopenmp                CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-fsanitize              CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-include                CCFLAGS
-imacros                CCFLAGS
-isysroot               CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-isystem                CCFLAGS
-iquote                 CCFLAGS
-idirafter              CCFLAGS
-I                      CPPPATH
-l                      LIBS
-L                      LIBPATH
-mno-cygwin             CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-mwindows               LINKFLAGS
-openmp                 CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-pthread                CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-std=                   CFLAGS
-stdlib=                CXXFLAGS
-Wa,                    ASFLAGS, CCFLAGS
-Wl,-rpath=             RPATH
-Wl,-R,                 RPATH
-Wl,-R                  RPATH
-Wl,                    LINKFLAGS
-Wp,                    CPPFLAGS
-                       CCFLAGS
+                       CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS

          Any other strings not associated with options are assumed to be
          the names of libraries and added to the $LIBS construction
          variable.

          Examples (all of which produce the same result):

dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2 -Dfoo -Dbar=1')
dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '-Dfoo', '-Dbar=1')
dict = env.ParseFlags(['-O2', '-Dfoo -Dbar=1'])
dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '!echo -Dfoo -Dbar=1')

   Platform(plat)
          env.Platform(plat)
          When called as a global function, returns a callable platform
          object selected by plat (defaults to the detected platform for
          the current system) that can be used to initialize a
          construction environment by passing it as the platform keyword
          argument to the [1475]Environment function.

          Example:

env = Environment(platform=Platform('win32'))

          When called as a method of an environment, calls the platform
          object indicated by plat to update that environment.

env.Platform('posix')

          See the manpage section "Construction Environments" for more
          details.

   Precious(target, ...)
          env.Precious(target, ...)
          Marks target as precious so it is not deleted before it is
          rebuilt. Normally SCons deletes a target before building it.
          Multiple targets can be passed in a single call, and may be
          strings and/or nodes. Returns a list of the affected target
          nodes.

   env.Prepend(key=val, [...])
          Prepend values to construction variables in the current
          construction environment, works like [1476]env.Append (see for
          details), except that values are added to the front, rather than
          the end, of any existing value of the construction variable

          Example:

env.Prepend(CCFLAGS='-g ', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

          See also [1477]env.Append, [1478]env.AppendUnique and
          [1479]env.PrependUnique.

   env.PrependENVPath(name, newpath, [envname, sep, delete_existing=True])
          Prepend directory paths from newpath to a search-path entry name
          in construction variable envname in the current enviromment
          (env). If envname is not given, the default is "ENV" (see
          [1480]$ENV). envname is expected to refer to a dictionary-like
          object; if it does not exist in env it will be created as an
          initially empty dict. newpath may be specified as a string, a
          directory node, or a list of strings. If a string, it may
          contain multiple paths separated by the system path separator
          (os.pathsep), or, if specified, by the value of sep.
          Top-relative path strings (starting with #) are recognized. The
          type of the existing value of name is preserved.

          Paths will only appear once. Duplicate paths in newpath are
          removed, preserving the first occurrence to maintain path order.
          If delete_existing is true (the default), existing duplicates
          are removed before prepending, otherwise, new duplicates are
          skipped. During comparisons, paths are normalized, to avoid
          issues with case differences (on case-insensitive filesystems)
          and with relative paths that may refer back to the same
          directory. The stored values are not modified by this process.

          Example:

print('before:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.PrependENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print('after:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])

          Yields:

before: /biz:/foo
after: /foo/bar:/foo:/biz

          See also [1481]env.AppendENVPath.

   env.PrependUnique(key=val, [...], [delete_existing=False])
          Prepend values to construction variables in the current
          construction environment, maintaining uniqueness. Works like
          [1482]env.Append, except that values are added to the front,
          rather than the end, of the construction variable, and values
          that would become duplicates are not added. If delete_existing
          is set to a true value, then for any duplicate, the existing
          instance of val is first removed, then val is inserted, having
          the effect of moving it to the front.

          Example:

env.PrependUnique(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

          See also [1483]env.Append, [1484]env.AppendUnique and
          [1485]env.Prepend.

   Progress(callable, [interval])
          Progress(string, [interval, file, overwrite])
          Progress(list_of_strings, [interval, file, overwrite])
          Allows SCons to show progress made during the build by
          displaying a string or calling a function while evaluating Nodes
          (e.g. files).

          If the first specified argument is a Python callable (a function
          or an object that has a __call__ method), the function will be
          called once every interval times a Node is evaluated (default
          1). The callable will be passed the evaluated Node as its only
          argument. (For future compatibility, it's a good idea to also
          add *args and **kwargs as arguments to your function or method
          signatures. This will prevent the code from breaking if SCons
          ever changes the interface to call the function with additional
          arguments in the future.)

          An example of a simple custom progress function that prints a
          string containing the Node name every 10 Nodes:

def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kwargs):
    print('Evaluating node %s!' % node)
Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)

          A more complicated example of a custom progress display object
          that prints a string containing a count every 100 evaluated
          Nodes. Note the use of \r (a carriage return) at the end so that
          the string will overwrite itself on a display:

import sys
class ProgressCounter(object):
    count = 0
    def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
        self.count += 100
        sys.stderr.write('Evaluated %s nodes\r' % self.count)

Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)

          If the first argument to Progress is a string or list of
          strings, it is taken as text to be displayed every interval
          evaluated Nodes. If the first argument is a list of strings,
          then each string in the list will be displayed in rotating
          fashion every interval evaluated Nodes.

          The default is to print the string on standard output. An
          alternate output stream may be specified with the file keyword
          argument, which the caller must pass already opened.

          The following will print a series of dots on the error output,
          one dot for every 100 evaluated Nodes:

import sys
Progress('.', interval=100, file=sys.stderr)

          If the string contains the verbatim substring $TARGET;, it will
          be replaced with the Node. Note that, for performance reasons,
          this is not a regular SCons variable substitution, so you can
          not use other variables or use curly braces. The following
          example will print the name of every evaluated Node, using a
          carriage return) (\r) to cause each line to overwritten by the
          next line, and the overwrite keyword argument (default False) to
          make sure the previously-printed file name is overwritten with
          blank spaces:

import sys
Progress('$TARGET\r', overwrite=True)

          A list of strings can be used to implement a "spinner" on the
          user's screen as follows, changing every five evaluated Nodes:

Progress(['-\r', '\\\r', '|\r', '/\r'], interval=5)

   Pseudo(target, ...)
          env.Pseudo(target, ...)
          Marks target as a pseudo target, not representing the production
          of any physical target file. If any pseudo target does exist,
          SCons will abort the build with an error. Multiple targets can
          be passed in a single call, and may be strings and/or Nodes.
          Returns a list of the affected target nodes.

          Pseudo may be useful in conjuction with a builder call (such as
          [1486]Command) which does not create a physical target, and the
          behavior if the target accidentally existed would be incorrect.
          This is similar in concept to the GNU make .PHONY target. SCons
          also provides a powerful target alias capability (see
          [1487]Alias) which may provide more flexibility in many
          situations when defining target names that are not directly
          built.

   PyPackageDir(modulename)
          env.PyPackageDir(modulename)
          Finds the location of modulename, which can be a string or a
          sequence of strings, each representing the name of a Python
          module. Construction variables are expanded in modulename.
          Returns a Directory Node (see [1488]Dir), or a list of Directory
          Nodes if modulename is a sequence. None is returned for any
          module not found.

          When a Tool module which is installed as a Python module is
          used, you need to specify a toolpath argument to [1489]Tool,
          [1490]Environment or [1491]Clone, as tools outside the standard
          project locations (site_scons/site_tools) will not be found
          otherwise. Using PyPackageDir allows this path to be discovered
          at runtime instead of hardcoding the path.

          Example:

env = Environment(
    tools=["default", "ExampleTool"],
    toolpath=[PyPackageDir("example_tool")]
)

   env.Replace(key=val, [...])
          Replaces construction variables in the Environment with the
          specified keyword arguments.

          Example:

env.Replace(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO='foo.xxx')

   Repository(directory)
          env.Repository(directory)
          Sets directory as a repository to be searched for files
          contributing to the build. Multiple calls to Repository are
          allowed, with repositories searched in the given order.
          Repositories specified via command-line option have higher
          priority.

          In scons, a repository is partial or complete copy of the source
          tree, from the top-level directory down, containing source files
          that can be used to build targets in the current worktree.
          Repositories can also contain derived files. An example might be
          an official source tree maintained by an integrator. If a
          repository contains derived files, they should be the result of
          building with SCons, so a signature database (sconsign) is
          present in the repository, allowing better decisions on whether
          they are up-to-date or not.

          Note that if an up-to-date derived file already exists in a
          repository, scons will not make a copy in the local directory
          tree. If you need a local copy to be made, use the [1492]Local
          method.

   Requires(target, prerequisite)
          env.Requires(target, prerequisite)
          Specifies an order-only relationship between target and
          prerequisite. The prerequisites will be (re)built, if necessary,
          before the target file(s), but the target file(s) do not
          actually depend on the prerequisites and will not be rebuilt
          simply because the prerequisite file(s) change. target and
          prerequisite may each be a string or Node, or a list of strings
          or Nodes. If there are multiple target values, the
          prerequisite(s) are added to each one. Returns a list of the
          affected target nodes.

          Example:

env.Requires('foo', 'file-that-must-be-built-before-foo')

   Return([vars..., stop=True])
          Return to the calling SConscript, optionally returning the
          values of variables named in vars. Multiple strings containing
          variable names may be passed to Return. A string containing
          white space is split into individual variable names. Returns the
          value if one variable is specified, else returns a tuple of
          values. Returns an empty tuple if vars is omitted.

          By default Return stops processing the current SConscript and
          returns immediately. The optional stop keyword argument may be
          set to a false value to continue processing the rest of the
          SConscript file after the Return call (this was the default
          behavior prior to SCons 0.98.) However, the values returned are
          still the values of the variables in the named vars at the point
          Return was called.

          Examples:

# Returns no values (evaluates False)
Return()

# Returns the value of the 'foo' Python variable.
Return("foo")

# Returns the values of the Python variables 'foo' and 'bar'.
Return("foo", "bar")

# Returns the values of Python variables 'val1' and 'val2'.
Return('val1 val2')

          env.Scanner(function, [name, argument, skeys, path_function,
          node_class, node_factory, scan_check, recursive])
          Creates a Scanner object for the specified function. See manpage
          section "Scanner Objects" for a complete explanation of the
          arguments and behavior.

   SConscript(scriptnames, [exports, variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist])
          env.SConscript(scriptnames, [exports, variant_dir, duplicate,
          must_exist])
          SConscript(dirs=subdirs, [name=scriptname, exports, variant_dir,
          duplicate, must_exist])
          env.SConscript(dirs=subdirs, [name=scriptname, exports,
          variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist])
          Executes subsidiary SConscript (build configuration) file(s).
          There are two ways to call the SConscript function.

          The first calling style is to supply one or more SConscript file
          names as the first positional argument, which can be a string or
          a list of strings. If there is a second positional argument, it
          is treated as if the exports keyword argument had been given
          (see below). Examples:

SConscript('SConscript')  # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript('src/SConscript')  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(['src/SConscript', 'doc/SConscript'])
SConscript(Split('src/SConscript doc/SConscript'))
config = SConscript('MyConfig.py')

          The second calling style is to omit the positional argument
          naming the script and instead specify directory names using the
          dirs keyword argument. The value can be a string or list of
          strings. In this case, scons will execute a subsidiary
          configuration file named SConscript (by default) in each of the
          specified directories. You may specify a name other than
          SConscript by supplying an optional name=scriptname keyword
          argument. The first three examples below have the same effect as
          the first three examples above:

SConscript(dirs='.')  # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(dirs='src')  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(dirs=['src', 'doc'])
SConscript(dirs=['sub1', 'sub2'], name='MySConscript')

          The optional exports keyword argument specifies variables to
          make available for use by the called SConscripts, which are
          evaluated in an isolated context and otherwise do not have
          access to local variables from the calling SConscript. The value
          may be a string or list of strings representing variable names,
          or a dictionary mapping local names to the names they can be
          imported by. For the first (scriptnames) calling style, a second
          positional argument will also be interpreted as exports; the
          second (directory) calling style accepts no positional arguments
          and must use the keyword form. These variables are locally
          exported only to the called SConscript file(s), and take
          precedence over any same-named variables in the global pool
          managed by the [1493]Export function. The subsidiary SConscript
          files must use the [1494]Import function to import the variables
          into their local scope. Examples:

foo = SConscript('sub/SConscript', exports='env')
SConscript('dir/SConscript', exports=['env', 'variable'])
SConscript(dirs='subdir', exports='env variable')
SConscript(dirs=['one', 'two', 'three'], exports='shared_info')

          If the optional variant_dir argument is present, it causes an
          effect equivalent to the [1495]VariantDir function, but in
          effect only within the scope of the SConscript call. The
          variant_dir argument is interpreted relative to the directory of
          the calling SConscript file. The source directory is the
          directory in which the called SConscript file resides and the
          SConscript file is evaluated as if it were in the variant_dir
          directory. Thus:

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build')

          is equivalent to:

VariantDir('build', 'src')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

          If the sources are in the same directory as the SConstruct,

SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='build')

          is equivalent to:

VariantDir('build', '.')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

          The optional duplicate argument is interpreted as for
          [1496]VariantDir. If the variant_dir argument is omitted, the
          duplicate argument is ignored. See the description of
          [1497]VariantDir for additional details and restrictions.

          If the optional must_exist is True (the default), an exception
          is raised if a requested SConscript file is not found. To allow
          missing scripts to be silently ignored (the default behavior
          prior to SCons version 3.1), pass must_exist=False in the
          SConscript call.

          Changed in 4.6.0: must_exist now defaults to True.

          Here are some composite examples:

# collect the configuration information and use it to build src and doc
shared_info = SConscript('MyConfig.py')
SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='shared_info')
SConscript('doc/SConscript', exports='shared_info')

# build debugging and production versions.  SConscript
# can use Dir('.').path to determine variant.
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0)
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0)

# build debugging and production versions.  SConscript
# is passed flags to use.
opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['DEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-pgdb' }
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0, exports=opts)
opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['NODEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-O' }
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0, exports=opts)

# build common documentation and compile for different architectures
SConscript('doc/SConscript', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/x86', duplicate=0)
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/ppc', duplicate=0)

          SConscript returns the values of any variables named by the
          executed SConscript file(s) in arguments to the [1498]Return
          function. If a single SConscript call causes multiple scripts to
          be executed, the return value is a tuple containing the returns
          of each of the scripts. If an executed script does not
          explicitly call Return, it returns None.

   SConscriptChdir(value)
          By default, scons changes its working directory to the directory
          in which each subsidiary SConscript file lives while reading and
          processing that script. This behavior may be disabled by
          specifying an argument which evaluates false, in which case
          scons will stay in the top-level directory while reading all
          SConscript files. (This may be necessary when building from
          repositories, when all the directories in which SConscript files
          may be found don't necessarily exist locally.) You may enable
          and disable this ability by calling SConscriptChdir multiple
          times.

          Example:

SConscriptChdir(False)
SConscript('foo/SConscript')    # will not chdir to foo
SConscriptChdir(True)
SConscript('bar/SConscript')    # will chdir to bar

   SConsignFile([name, dbm_module])
          env.SConsignFile([name, dbm_module])
          Specify where to store the SCons file signature database, and
          which database format to use. This may be useful to specify
          alternate database files and/or file locations for different
          types of builds.

          The optional name argument is the base name of the database
          file(s). If not an absolute path name, these are placed relative
          to the directory containing the top-level SConstruct file. The
          default is .sconsign. The actual database file(s) stored on disk
          may have an appropriate suffix appended by the chosen dbm_module

          The optional dbm_module argument specifies which Python database
          module to use for reading/writing the file. The module must be
          imported first; then the imported module name is passed as the
          argument. The default is a custom SCons.dblite module that uses
          pickled Python data structures, which works on all Python
          versions. See documentation of the Python dbm module for other
          available types.

          If called with no arguments, the database will default to
          .sconsign.dblite in the top directory of the project, which is
          also the default if if SConsignFile is not called.

          The setting is global, so the only difference between the global
          function and the environment method form is variable expansion
          on name. There should only be one active call to this
          function/method in a given build setup.

          If name is set to None, scons will store file signatures in a
          separate .sconsign file in each directory, not in a single
          combined database file. This is a backwards-compatibility
          measure to support what was the default behavior prior to SCons
          0.97 (i.e. before 2008). Use of this mode is discouraged and may
          be deprecated in a future SCons release.

          Examples:

# Explicitly stores signatures in ".sconsign.dblite"
# in the top-level SConstruct directory (the default behavior).
SConsignFile()

# Stores signatures in the file "etc/scons-signatures"
# relative to the top-level SConstruct directory.
# SCons will add a database suffix to this name.
SConsignFile("etc/scons-signatures")

# Stores signatures in the specified absolute file name.
# SCons will add a database suffix to this name.
SConsignFile("/home/me/SCons/signatures")

# Stores signatures in a separate .sconsign file
# in each directory.
SConsignFile(None)

# Stores signatures in a GNU dbm format .sconsign file
import dbm.gnu
SConsignFile(dbm_module=dbm.gnu)

   env.SetDefault(key=val, [...])
          Sets construction variables to default values specified with the
          keyword arguments if (and only if) the variables are not already
          set. The following statements are equivalent:

env.SetDefault(FOO='foo')
if 'FOO' not in env:
    env['FOO'] = 'foo'

   SetOption(name, value)
          env.SetOption(name, value)
          Sets scons option variable name to value. These options are all
          also settable via command-line options but the variable name may
          differ from the command-line option name - see the table for
          correspondences. A value set via command-line option will take
          precedence over one set with SetOption, which allows setting a
          project default in the scripts and temporarily overriding it via
          command line. SetOption calls can also be placed in the
          site_init.py file.

          See the documentation in the manpage for the corresponding
          command line option for information about each specific option.
          The value parameter is mandatory, for option values which are
          boolean in nature (that is, the command line option does not
          take an argument) use a value which evaluates to true (e.g.
          True, 1) or false (e.g. False, 0).

          Options which affect the reading and processing of SConscript
          files are not settable using SetOption since those files must be
          read in order to find the SetOption call in the first place.

          For project-specific options (sometimes called local options)
          added via an [1499]AddOption call, SetOption is available only
          after the AddOption call has completed successfully, and only if
          that call included the settable=True argument.

          The settable variables with their associated command-line
          options are:

   Settable name Command-line options Notes
   clean -c, --clean, --remove
   diskcheck --diskcheck
   duplicate --duplicate
   experimental --experimental since 4.2
   hash_chunksize --hash-chunksize Actually sets md5_chunksize. since 4.2
   hash_format --hash-format since 4.2
   help -h, --help
   implicit_cache --implicit-cache
   implicit_deps_changed --implicit-deps-changed Also sets implicit_cache.
   (settable since 4.2)
   implicit_deps_unchanged --implicit-deps-unchanged Also sets
   implicit_cache. (settable since 4.2)
   max_drift --max-drift
   md5_chunksize --md5-chunksize
   no_exec -n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
   no_progress -Q See ^[[1500]a]
   num_jobs -j, --jobs
   random --random
   silent -s, --silent, --quiet
   stack_size --stack-size
   warn --warn
   ^[[1501]a] If no_progress is set via SetOption in an SConscript file
   (but not if set in a site_init.py file) there will still be an initial
   status message about reading SConscript files since SCons has to start
   reading them before it can see the SetOption.

          Example:

SetOption('max_drift', 0)

   SideEffect(side_effect, target)
          env.SideEffect(side_effect, target)
          Declares side_effect as a side effect of building target. Both
          side_effect and target can be a list, a file name, or a node. A
          side effect is a target file that is created or updated as a
          side effect of building other targets. For example, a Windows
          PDB file is created as a side effect of building the .obj files
          for a static library, and various log files are created updated
          as side effects of various TeX commands. If a target is a side
          effect of multiple build commands, scons will ensure that only
          one set of commands is executed at a time. Consequently, you
          only need to use this method for side-effect targets that are
          built as a result of multiple build commands.

          Because multiple build commands may update the same side effect
          file, by default the side_effect target is not automatically
          removed when the target is removed by the -c option. (Note,
          however, that the side_effect might be removed as part of
          cleaning the directory in which it lives.) If you want to make
          sure the side_effect is cleaned whenever a specific target is
          cleaned, you must specify this explicitly with the [1502]Clean
          or env.Clean function.

          This function returns the list of side effect Node objects that
          were successfully added. If the list of side effects contained
          any side effects that had already been added, they are not added
          and included in the returned list.

   Split(arg)
          env.Split(arg)
          If arg is a string, splits on whitespace and returns a list of
          strings without whitespace. This mode is the most common case,
          and can be used to split a list of filenames (for example)
          rather than having to type them as a list of individually quoted
          words. If arg is a list or tuple returns the list or tuple
          unchanged. If arg is any other type of object, returns a list
          containing just the object. These non-string cases do not
          actually do any spliting, but allow an argument variable to be
          passed to Split without having to first check its type.

          Example:

files = Split("f1.c f2.c f3.c")
files = env.Split("f4.c f5.c f6.c")
files = Split("""
    f7.c
    f8.c
    f9.c
""")

   env.subst(input, [raw, target, source, conv])
          Performs construction variable interpolation (substitution) on
          input, which can be a string or a sequence. Substitutable
          elements take the form ${expression}, although if there is no
          ambiguity in recognizing the element, the braces can be omitted.
          A literal $ can be entered by using $$.

          By default, leading or trailing white space will be removed from
          the result, and all sequences of white space will be compressed
          to a single space character. Additionally, any $( and $)
          character sequences will be stripped from the returned string,
          The optional raw argument may be set to 1 if you want to
          preserve white space and $(-$) sequences. The raw argument may
          be set to 2 if you want to additionally discard all characters
          between any $( and $) pairs (as is done for signature
          calculation).

          If input is a sequence (list or tuple), the individual elements
          of the sequence will be expanded, and the results will be
          returned as a list.

          The optional target and source keyword arguments must be set to
          lists of target and source nodes, respectively, if you want the
          $TARGET, $TARGETS, $SOURCE and $SOURCES to be available for
          expansion. This is usually necessary if you are calling
          env.subst from within a Python function used as an SCons action.

          Returned string values or sequence elements are converted to
          their string representation by default. The optional conv
          argument may specify a conversion function that will be used in
          place of the default. For example, if you want Python objects
          (including SCons Nodes) to be returned as Python objects, you
          can use a Python lambda expression to pass in an unnamed
          function that simply returns its unconverted argument.

          Example:

print(env.subst("The C compiler is: $CC"))

def compile(target, source, env):
    sourceDir = env.subst(
        "${SOURCE.srcdir}",
        target=target,
        source=source
    )

source_nodes = env.subst('$EXPAND_TO_NODELIST', conv=lambda x: x)

   Tag(node, tags)
          Annotates file or directory Nodes with information about how the
          [1503]Package Builder should package those files or directories.
          All Node-level tags are optional.

          Examples:

# makes sure the built library will be installed with 644 file access mode
Tag(Library('lib.c'), UNIX_ATTR="0o644")

# marks file2.txt to be a documentation file
Tag('file2.txt', DOC)

   Tool(name, [toolpath, key=value, ...])
          env.Tool(name, [toolpath, key=value, ...])
          Locates the tool specification module name and returns a
          callable tool object for that tool. When the environment method
          (env.Tool) form is used, the tool object is automatically called
          before the method returns to update env, and name is appended to
          the [1504]$TOOLS construction variable in that environment. When
          the global function Tool form is used, the tool object is
          constructed but not called, as it lacks the context of an
          environment to update, and the returned object needs to be used
          to arrange for the call.

          The tool module is searched for in the tool search paths (see
          the Tools section in the manual page for details) and in any
          paths specified by the optional toolpath parameter, which must
          be a list of strings. If toolpath is omitted, the toolpath
          supplied when the environment was created, if any, is used.

          Any remaining keyword arguments are saved in the tool object,
          and will be passed to the tool module's generate function when
          the tool object is actually called. The generate function can
          update the construction environment with construction variables
          and arrange any other initialization needed to use the
          mechanisms that tool describes, and can use these extra
          arguments to help guide its actions.

          Changed in version 4.2: env.Tool now returns the tool object,
          previously it did not return (i.e. returned None).

          Examples:

env.Tool('gcc')
env.Tool('opengl', toolpath=['build/tools'])

          The returned tool object can be passed to an [1505]Environment
          or [1506]Clone call as part of the tools keyword argument, in
          which case the tool is applied to the environment being
          constructed, or it can be called directly, in which case a
          construction environment to update must be passed as the
          argument. Either approach will also update the $TOOLS
          construction variable.

          Examples:

env = Environment(tools=[Tool('msvc')])

env = Environment()
msvctool = Tool('msvc')
msvctool(env)  # adds 'msvc' to the TOOLS variable
gltool = Tool('opengl', toolpath = ['tools'])
gltool(env)  # adds 'opengl' to the TOOLS variable

   ValidateOptions([throw_exception=False])
          Check that all the options specified on the command line are
          either SCons built-in options or defined via calls to
          [1507]AddOption. SCons will eventually fail on unknown options
          anyway, but calling this function allows the build to "fail
          fast" before executing expensive logic later in the build.

          This function should only be called after the last AddOption
          call in your SConscript logic. Be aware that some tools call
          AddOption, if you are getting error messages for arguments that
          they add, you will need to ensure that those tools are loaded
          before calling ValidateOptions.

          If there are any unknown command line options, ValidateOptions
          prints an error message and exits with an error exit status. If
          the optional throw_exception argument is True (default is
          False), a SConsBadOptionError is raised, giving an opportunity
          for the SConscript logic to catch that exception and handle
          invalid options appropriately. Note that this exception name
          needs to be imported (see the example below).

          A common build problem is typos (or thinkos) - a user enters an
          option that is just a little off the expected value, or perhaps
          a different word with a similar meaning. It may be useful to
          abort the build before going too far down the wrong path. For
          example:

$ scons --compilers=mingw  # the correct flag is --compiler

          Here SCons could go off and run a bunch of configure steps with
          the default value of --compiler, since the incorrect command
          line did not actually supply a value to it, costing developer
          time to track down why the configure logic made the "wrong"
          choices. This example shows catching this:

from SCons.Script.SConsOptions import SConsBadOptionError

AddOption(
    '--compiler',
    dest='compiler',
    action='store',
    default='gcc',
    type='string',
)

# ... other SConscript logic ...

try:
    ValidateOptions(throw_exception=True)
except SConsBadOptionError as e:
    print(f"ValidateOptions detects a fail: ", e.opt_str)
    Exit(3)

          New in version 4.5.0

   Value(value, [built_value], [name])
          env.Value(value, [built_value], [name])
          Returns a Node object representing the specified Python value.
          Value Nodes can be used as dependencies of targets. If the
          string representation of the Value Node changes between SCons
          runs, it is considered out-of-date and any targets depending on
          it will be rebuilt. Since Value Nodes have no filesystem
          representation, timestamps are not used; the timestamp deciders
          perform the same content-based up to date check.

          The optional built_value argument can be specified when the
          Value Node is created to indicate the Node should already be
          considered "built."

          The optional name parameter can be provided as an alternative
          name for the resulting Value node; this is advised if the value
          parameter cannot be converted to a string.

          Value Nodes have a write method that can be used to "build" a
          Value Node by setting a new value. The corresponding read method
          returns the built value of the Node.

          Changed in version 4.0: the name parameter was added.

          Examples:

env = Environment()

def create(target, source, env):
    """Action function to create a file from a Value.

    Writes 'prefix=$SOURCE' into the file name given as $TARGET.
    """
    with open(target[0], 'wb') as f:
        f.write(b'prefix=' + source[0].get_contents() + b'\n')

# Fetch the prefix= argument, if any, from the command line.
# Use /usr/local as the default.
prefix = ARGUMENTS.get('prefix', '/usr/local')

# Attach builder named Config to the construction environment
# using the 'create' action function above.
env['BUILDERS']['Config'] = Builder(action=create)
env.Config(target='package-config', source=Value(prefix))

def build_value(target, source, env):
    """Action function to "build" a Value.

    Writes contents of $SOURCE into $TARGET, thus updating if it existed.
    """
    target[0].write(source[0].get_contents())

output = env.Value('before')
input = env.Value('after')

# Attach a builder named UpdateValue to the construction environment
# using the 'build_value' action function above.
env['BUILDERS']['UpdateValue'] = Builder(action=build_value)
env.UpdateValue(target=Value(output), source=Value(input))

   VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])
          env.VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])
          Sets up a mapping to define a variant build directory in
          variant_dir. src_dir must not be underneath variant_dir. A
          VariantDir mapping is global, even if called using the
          env.VariantDir form. VariantDir can be called multiple times
          with the same src_dir to set up multiple variant builds with
          different options.

          Note if variant_dir is not under the project top directory,
          target selection rules will not pick targets in the variant
          directory unless they are explicitly specified.

          When files in variant_dir are referenced, SCons backfills as
          needed with files from src_dir to create a complete build
          directory. By default, SCons physically duplicates the source
          files, SConscript files, and directory structure as needed into
          the variant directory. Thus, a build performed in the variant
          directory is guaranteed to be identical to a build performed in
          the source directory even if intermediate source files are
          generated during the build, or if preprocessors or other
          scanners search for included files using paths relative to the
          source file, or if individual compilers or other invoked tools
          are hard-coded to put derived files in the same directory as
          source files. Only the files SCons calculates are needed for the
          build are duplicated into variant_dir. If possible on the
          platform, the duplication is performed by linking rather than
          copying. This behavior is affected by the --duplicate
          command-line option.

          Duplicating the source files may be disabled by setting the
          duplicate argument to False. This will cause SCons to invoke
          Builders using the path names of source files in src_dir and the
          path names of derived files within variant_dir. This is more
          efficient than duplicating, and is safe for most builds; revert
          to duplicate=True if it causes problems.

          VariantDir works most naturally when used with a subsidiary
          SConscript file. The subsidiary SConscript file must be called
          as if it were in variant_dir, regardless of the value of
          duplicate. When calling an SConscript file, you can use the
          exports keyword argument to pass parameters (individually or as
          an appropriately set up environment) so the SConscript can pick
          up the right settings for that variant build. The SConscript
          must [1508]Import these to use them. Example:

env1 = Environment(...settings for variant1...)
env2 = Environment(...settings for variant2...)

# run src/SConscript in two variant directories
VariantDir('build/variant1', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant1/SConscript', exports={"env": env1})
VariantDir('build/variant2', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant2/SConscript', exports={"env": env2})

          See also the [1509]SConscript function for another way to
          specify a variant directory in conjunction with calling a
          subsidiary SConscript file.

          More examples:

# use names in the build directory, not the source directory
VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=0)
Program('build/prog', 'build/source.c')

# this builds both the source and docs in a separate subtree
VariantDir('build', '.', duplicate=0)
SConscript(dirs=['build/src','build/doc'])

# same as previous example, but only uses SConscript
SConscript(dirs='src', variant_dir='build/src', duplicate=0)
SConscript(dirs='doc', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)

   Virtualenv()
          If the SCons process is running inside a Python virtual
          environment, return the path to the directory where that
          environment is stored, else an empty string. The result can be
          treated as a boolean value if the path is unneeded.

   WhereIs(program, [path, pathext, reject])
          env.WhereIs(program, [path, pathext, reject])
          Searches for the specified executable program, returning the
          full path to the program or None.

          When called as a construction environment method, searches the
          paths in the path keyword argument, or if None (the default) the
          paths listed in the construction environment
          (env['ENV']['PATH']). The external environment's path list
          (os.environ['PATH']) is used as a fallback if the key
          env['ENV']['PATH'] does not exist.

          On Windows systems, searches for executable programs with any of
          the file extensions listed in the pathext keyword argument, or
          if None (the default) the pathname extensions listed in the
          construction environment (env['ENV']['PATHEXT']). The external
          environment's pathname extensions list (os.environ['PATHEXT'])
          is used as a fallback if the key env['ENV']['PATHEXT'] does not
          exist.

          When called as a global function, uses the external
          environment's path os.environ['PATH'] and path extensions
          os.environ['PATHEXT'], respectively, if path and pathext are
          None.

          Will not select any path name or names in the optional reject
          list.

SConscript Variables

   In addition to the global functions and methods, scons supports a
   number of variables that can be used for run-time queries in SConscript
   files to affect how you want the build to be performed.

   ARGLIST
          A list of the variable=value build variable arguments specified
          on the command line. Each element in the list is a tuple
          consisting of the variable and its value. The separate variable
          and value elements of the tuple can be accessed by subscripting
          for elements [0] and [1] of the tuple, or, more readably, by
          using tuple unpacking. Examples:

print("first variable, value =", ARGLIST[0][0], ARGLIST[0][1])
print("second variable, value =", ARGLIST[1][0], ARGLIST[1][1])
var, value = ARGLIST[2]
print("third variable, value =", var, value)
for var, value in ARGLIST:
    # process variable and value

          The values obtained from ARGLIST (or from [1510]ARGUMENTS) are
          always strings since they originate from outside the SCons
          process. As "untrusted data", they should be validated before
          usage, and may need conversion to an appropriate type.

   ARGUMENTS
          A dictionary of all the variable=value build variable arguments
          specified on the command line. The dictionary is in command-line
          order, so if a given variable has more than one value assigned
          to it on the command line, the last (right-most) value is the
          one saved in the ARGUMENTS dictionary.

          Example:

if ARGUMENTS.get("debug", ""):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS="-g")
else:
    env = Environment()

          See also [1511]ARGLIST.

   BUILD_TARGETS
          A list of the targets which scons has been asked to build. The
          contents will be either those targets listed on the command
          line, or, if none, those targets set via calls to the
          [1512]Default function. It does not contain any dependent
          targets that scons selects for building as a result of making
          the sure the specified targets are up to date, if those targets
          did not appear on the command line. The list is empty if neither
          command line targets nor Default calls are present.

          The elements of this list may be strings or nodes, so you should
          run the list through the Python str function to make sure any
          Node path names are converted to strings.

          Because this list may be taken from the list of targets
          specified using the Default function, the contents of the list
          may change on each successive call to Default. See
          [1513]DEFAULT_TARGETS for additional information.

          Example:

if 'foo' in BUILD_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
if 'special/program' in BUILD_TARGETS:
    SConscript('special')

   COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS
          A list of the targets explicitly specified on the command line.
          If there are command line targets, this list has the same
          contents as [1514]BUILD_TARGETS. If there are no targets
          specified on the command line, this list is empty. The elements
          of this list are strings. This can be used, for example, to take
          specific actions only when a certain target(s) are explicitly
          requested for building.

          Example:

if 'foo' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
if 'special/program' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    SConscript('special')

   DEFAULT_TARGETS
          A list of the target nodes that have been specified using the
          [1515]Default function. If there are no command line targets,
          this list will have the same contents as [1516]BUILD_TARGETS.
          Since the elements of the list are nodes, you need to call the
          Python str function on them to get the path name for each Node.

          Example:

print(str(DEFAULT_TARGETS[0]))
if 'foo' in [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS]:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")

          The contents of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list changes on each
          successive call to the Default function:

print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # originally []
Default('foo')
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo']
Default('bar')
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo', 'bar']
Default(None)
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # back to []

          Consequently, be sure to use DEFAULT_TARGETS only after you've
          made all of your Default() calls, or else simply be careful of
          the order of these statements in your SConscript files so that
          you don't look for a specific default target before it's
          actually been added to the list.

   These variables may be accessed from custom Python modules that you
   import into an SConscript file by adding the following to the Python
   module:
from SCons.Script import *

Construction Variables

   Construction Variables are key-value pairs used to store information in
   a construction environment that is needed needed for builds using that
   environment. Construction variable naming must follow the same rules as
   Python identifier naming: the initial character must be an underscore
   or letter, followed by any number of underscores, letters, or digits.
   The convention is to use uppercase for all letters for easier visual
   identification.

   Construction variables are used to hold many different types of
   information. For example, the [1517]$CPPDEFINES variable is how to tell
   a C/C++ compiler about preprocessor macros you need for your build. The
   tool discovery that SCons performs will cause the [1518]$CXX variable
   to hold the name of the C++ compiler, if one was detected on the
   system, but you can give it a different value to force a compiler
   command of a different name to be used. Some variables contain lists of
   filename suffixes that are recognized by a particular compiler chain.
   [1519]$BUILDERS contains a mapping of configured Builder names (e.g.
   [1520]Textfile) to the actual Builder instance to call when that
   Builder is used. Construction variables may include references to other
   construction variables: the same tool which set up the C/C++ compiler
   will also set up an "action string", describing how to invoke that
   compiler, in [1521]$CXXCOM, which contains other construction variables
   using $VARIABLE syntax. These references will be expanded and replaced
   on use (see [1522]Variable Substitution).

   Construction variables are referenced as if they were keys and values
   in a Python dictionary:
env["CC"] = "cc"
flags = env.get("CPPDEFINES", [])

   Construction variables can also be retrieved and set by using the
   [1523]Dictionary method of the construction environment to create an
   actual dictionary:
cvars = env.Dictionary()
cvars["CC"] = "cc"

   in the previous example, since cvars is an external copy, the value of
   $CC in the construction environment itself is not changed by the
   assignment.

   Construction variables can set by passing them as keyword arguments
   when creating a new construction environment:
env = Environment(CC="cc")

   or when copying a construction environment using the [1524]Clone
   method:
env2 = env.Clone(CC="cl.exe")

   Construction variables can also be supplied as keyword arguments to a
   builder, in which case those settings affect only the work done by that
   builder call, and not the construction environment as a whole. This
   concept is called an override:
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])

   Many useful construction variables are automatically defined by SCons,
   tuned to the specific platform in use, and you can modify these or
   define any additional construction variables for use in your own
   Builders, Scanners and other tools. Take care not to overwrite ones
   which SCons is using. The following is a list of predefined
   construction variables. Pay attention to whether the values are ones
   you may be expected to set vs. ones that are set to expected values by
   internal tools and other initializations and probably should not be
   modified.

   Note the actual list available at execution time will never include all
   of these, as the ones detected as not being applicable (wrong platform,
   necessary external command or files not installed, etc.) will not be
   set up. Correct build setups should be resilient to the possible
   absence of certain construction variables before using them, for
   example by using a Python dictionary get method to retrieve the value
   and taking alternative action if the return indicates the variable is
   unset. The [1525]env.Dump method can be called to examine the
   construction variables set in a particular environment.

   __LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          This construction variable automatically introduces
          [1526]$_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS if [1527]$LDMODULEVERSION is set.
          Otherwise, it evaluates to an empty string.

   __SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          This construction variable automatically introduces
          [1528]$_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS if [1529]$SHLIBVERSION is set.
          Otherwise, it evaluates to an empty string.

   APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag:
          -compatibility_version

          The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and
          65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and 255, Z can be omitted
          or between 1 and 255. This value will be derived from
          [1530]$SHLIBVERSION if not specified. The lowest digit will be
          dropped and replaced by a 0.

          If the [1531]$APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION is set then no
          -compatibility_version will be output.

          See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

   _APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the
          linker flags to specify apple's linker's -compatibility_version
          flag. The default generator uses
          [1532]$APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and
          [1533]$APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and
          [1534]$SHLIBVERSION to determine the correct flag.

   APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION
          On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag:
          -current_version

          The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and
          65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and 255, Z can be omitted
          or between 1 and 255. This value will be set to
          [1535]$SHLIBVERSION if not specified.

          If the [1536]$APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION is set then no
          -current_version will be output.

          See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

   _APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION
          A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the
          linker flags to specify apple's linker's -current_version flag.
          The default generator uses [1537]$APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION and
          [1538]$APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION and [1539]$SHLIBVERSION to
          determine the correct flag.

   APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable
          adding -compatibility_version flag when generating versioned
          shared libraries.

          This overrides [1540]$APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION.

   APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION
          Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable
          adding -current_version flag when generating versioned shared
          libraries.

          This overrides [1541]$APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION.

   AR

   ARCHITECTURE
          Specifies the system architecture for which the package is being
          built. The default is the system architecture of the machine on

          Architecture: field in an Ipkg control file, and the BuildArch:
          field in the RPM .spec file, as well as forming part of the name
          of a generated RPM package file.

          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1545]$ASFLAGS
          and [1546]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line.

   ASPPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file after first running the file

          A dictionary mapping the names of the builders available through
          the construction environment to underlying Builder objects.
          Custom builders need to be added to this to make them available.

          A platform-dependent default list of builders such as
          [1550]Program, [1551]Library etc. is used to populate this
          construction variable when the construction environment is
          initialized via the presence/absence of the tools those builders
          depend on. $BUILDERS can be examined to learn which builders
          will actually be available at run-time.

          Note that if you initialize this construction variable through
          assignment when the construction environment is created, that
          value for $BUILDERS will override any defaults:

bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'NewBuilder': bld})

          To instead use a new Builder object in addition to the default
          Builders, add your new Builder object like this:

env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS={'NewBuilder': bld})

          or this:

env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS']['NewBuilder'] = bld

   CACHEDIR_CLASS
          The class type that SCons should use when instantiating a new
          [1552]CacheDir in this construction environment. Must be a
          subclass of the SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir class.

   CC
          The C compiler.

   CCCOM
          The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static)
          object file. Any options specified in the [1553]$CFLAGS,
          [1554]$CCFLAGS and [1555]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are
          included on this command line. See also [1556]$SHCCCOM for
          compiling to shared objects.

   CCCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a C source file is compiled to
          a (static) object file. If not set, then [1557]$CCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed. See also [1558]$SHCCCOMSTR for
          compiling to shared objects.

env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CCDEPFLAGS
          Options to pass to C or C++ compiler to generate list of
          dependency files.

          This is set only by compilers which support this functionality.
          ([1559]gcc, [1560]clang, and [1561]msvc currently)

   CCFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C and C++ compilers. See
          also [1562]$SHCCFLAGS for compiling to shared objects.

   CCPCHFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support building
          with precompiled headers. The default value expands expands to
          the appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options when
          the [1563]$PCH construction variable is set.

   CCPDBFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support storing
          debugging information in a Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file. The
          default value expands expands to appropriate Microsoft Visual
          C++ command-line options when the [1564]$PDB construction
          variable is set.

          The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by
          default to generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly
          with parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug
          information in the intermediate object files, as opposed to
          sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files. This is
          also the only way to get debug information embedded into a
          static library. Using the /Zi instead may yield improved
          link-time performance, although parallel builds will no longer
          work.

          You can generate PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the
          default [1565]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = ['${(PDB and "/Zi /Fd%s" % File(PDB)) or ""}']

          An alternative would be to use the /Zi to put the debugging
          information in a separate .pdb file for each object file by
          overriding the [1566]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = '/Zi /Fd${TARGET}.pdb'

   CCVERSION
          The version number of the C compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C compiler being used.

   CFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C source files. This is used by the internal
          CFile builder when generating C files from Lex (.l) or YACC (.y)
          input files. The default suffix, of course, is .c (lower case).
          On case-insensitive systems (like Windows), SCons also treats .C
          (upper case) files as C files.

   CFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C compiler (C only; not
          C++). See also [1567]$SHCFLAGS for compiling to shared objects.

   CHANGE_SPECFILE
          A hook for modifying the file that controls the packaging build
          (the .spec for RPM, the control for Ipkg, the .wxs for MSI). If
          set, the function will be called after the SCons template for
          the file has been written.

          See the [1568]Package builder.

   CHANGED_SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   CHANGED_TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   CHANGELOG
          The name of a file containing the change log text to be included
          in the package. This is included as the %changelog section of
          the RPM .spec file.

          See the [1569]Package builder.

   COMPILATIONDB_COMSTR
          The string displayed when the [1570]CompilationDatabase
          builder's action is run.

   COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER
          A string which instructs [1571]CompilationDatabase to only
          include entries where the output member matches the pattern in
          the filter string using fnmatch, which uses glob style
          wildcards.

          The default value is an empty string '', which disables
          filtering.

   COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH
          A boolean flag to instruct [1572]CompilationDatabase whether to
          write the file and output members in the compilation database
          using absolute or relative paths.

          The default value is False (use relative paths)

   _concat
          A function used to produce variables like [1573]$_CPPINCFLAGS.
          It takes four mandatory arguments, and up to 4 additional
          optional arguments: 1) a prefix to concatenate onto each
          element, 2) a list of elements, 3) a suffix to concatenate onto
          each element, 4) an environment for variable interpolation, 5)
          an optional function that will be called to transform the list
          before concatenation, 6) an optionally specified target (Can use
          TARGET), 7) an optionally specified source (Can use SOURCE), 8)
          optional affect_signature flag which will wrap non-empty
          returned value with $( and $) to indicate the contents should
          not affect the signature of the generated command line.

        env['_CPPINCFLAGS'] = '${_concat(INCPREFIX, CPPPATH, INCSUFFIX, __env__,
 RDirs, TARGET, SOURCE, affect_signature=False)}'

   CONFIGUREDIR
          The name of the directory in which Configure context test files
          are written. The default is .sconf_temp in the top-level
          directory containing the SConstruct file.

          If variant directories are in use, and the configure check
          results should not be shared between variants, you can set
          $CONFIGUREDIR and [1574]$CONFIGURELOG so they are unique per
          variant directory.

   CONFIGURELOG
          The name of the Configure context log file. The default is
          config.log in the top-level directory containing the SConstruct
          file.

          If variant directories are in use, and the configure check
          results should not be shared between variants, you can set
          [1575]$CONFIGUREDIR and $CONFIGURELOG so they are unique per
          variant directory.

   _CPPDEFFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options to define values. The value
          of [1576]$_CPPDEFFLAGS is created by respectively prepending and
          appending [1577]$CPPDEFPREFIX and [1578]$CPPDEFSUFFIX to each
          definition in [1579]$CPPDEFINES.

   CPPDEFINES
          A platform independent specification of C preprocessor macro
          definitions. The definitions are added to command lines through
          the automatically-generated [1580]$_CPPDEFFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed according to the contents of
          $CPPDEFINES:

          + If $CPPDEFINES is a string, the values of the
            [1581]$CPPDEFPREFIX and [1582]$CPPDEFSUFFIX construction
            variables are respectively prepended and appended to each
            definition in $CPPDEFINES, split on whitespace.
# Adds -Dxyz to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /Dxyz to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES='xyz')

          + If $CPPDEFINES is a list, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and
            $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables are respectively
            prepended and appended to each element in the list. If any
            element is a tuple (or list) then the first item of the tuple
            is the macro name and the second is the macro definition. If
            the definition is not omitted or None, the name and definition
            are combined into a single name=definition item before the
            prepending/appending.
# Adds -DB=2 -DA to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DB=2 /DA to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('B', 2), 'A'])

          + If $CPPDEFINES is a dictionary, the values of the
            $CPPDEFPREFIX and $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables are
            respectively prepended and appended to each key from the
            dictionary. If the value for a key is not None, then the key
            (macro name) and the value (macros definition) are combined
            into a single name=definition item before the
            prepending/appending.
# Adds -DA -DB=2 to POSIX compiler command lines,
# or /DA /DB=2 to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES={'B':2, 'A':None})

          Depending on how contents are added to $CPPDEFINES, it may be
          transformed into a compound type, for example a list containing
          strings, tuples and/or dictionaries. SCons can correctly expand
          such a compound type.

          Note that SCons may call the compiler via a shell. If a macro
          definition contains characters such as spaces that have meaning
          to the shell, or is intended to be a string value, you may need
          to use the shell's quoting syntax to avoid interpretation by the
          shell before the preprocessor sees it. Function-like macros are
          not supported via this mechanism (and some compilers do not even
          implement that functionality via the command lines). When
          quoting, note that one set of quote characters are used to
          define a Python string, then quotes embedded inside that would
          be consumed by the shell unless escaped. These examples may help
          illustrate:

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=['USE_ALT_HEADER=\\"foo_alt.h\\"'])
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('USE_ALT_HEADER', '\\"foo_alt.h\\"')])

          :Changed in version 4.5: SCons no longer sorts $CPPDEFINES
          values entered in dictionary form. Python now preserves
          dictionary keys in the order they are entered, so it is no
          longer necessary to sort them to ensure a stable command line.

   CPPDEFPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify preprocessor macro definitions on the
          C compiler command line. This will be prepended to each
          definition in the [1583]$CPPDEFINES construction variable when
          the [1584]$_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPDEFSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify preprocessor macro definitions on the
          C compiler command line. This will be appended to each
          definition in the [1585]$CPPDEFINES construction variable when
          the [1586]$_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPFLAGS
          User-specified C preprocessor options. These will be included in
          any command that uses the C preprocessor, including not just
          compilation of C and C++ source files via the [1587]$CCCOM,
          [1588]$SHCCCOM, [1589]$CXXCOM and [1590]$SHCXXCOM command lines,
          but also the [1591]$FORTRANPPCOM, [1592]$SHFORTRANPPCOM,
          [1593]$F77PPCOM and [1594]$SHF77PPCOM command lines used to
          compile a Fortran source file, and the [1595]$ASPPCOM command
          line used to assemble an assembly language source file, after
          first running each file through the C preprocessor. Note that
          this variable does not contain -I (or similar) include search
          path options that scons generates automatically from
          [1596]$CPPPATH. See [1597]$_CPPINCFLAGS, below, for the variable
          that expands to those options.

   _CPPINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files. The value of $_CPPINCFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending
          [1598]$INCPREFIX and [1599]$INCSUFFIX to each directory in
          [1600]$CPPPATH.

   CPPPATH
          The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for
          include directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. In general, it's not
          advised to put include directory directives directly into
          [1601]$CCFLAGS or [1602]$CXXFLAGS as the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. $CPPPATH should be a list of path strings,
          or a single string, not a pathname list joined by Python's
          os.pathsep.

          Note: directory names in $CPPPATH will be looked-up relative to
          the directory of the SConscript file when they are used in a
          command. To force scons to lookup a directory relative to the
          root of the source tree, use the # prefix:

env = Environment(CPPPATH='#/include')

          The directory lookup can also be forced using the [1603]Dir
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(CPPPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1604]$_CPPINCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and
          appending the values of the [1605]$INCPREFIX and
          [1606]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to each directory in
          [1607]$CPPPATH. Any command lines you define that need the
          $CPPPATH directory list should include [1608]$_CPPINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(CCCOM="my_compiler $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   CPPSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for C
          preprocessor implicit dependencies (#include lines). The default
          list is:

[".c", ".C", ".cxx", ".cpp", ".c++", ".cc",
 ".h", ".H", ".hxx", ".hpp", ".hh",
 ".F", ".fpp", ".FPP",
 ".m", ".mm",
 ".S", ".spp", ".SPP"]

   CXX
          The C++ compiler. See also [1609]$SHCXX for compiling to shared
          objects.

   CXXCOM
          The command line used to compile a C++ source file to an object
          file. Any options specified in the [1610]$CXXFLAGS and
          [1611]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. See also [1612]$SHCXXCOM for compiling to shared
          objects.

   CXXCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a C++ source file is compiled
          to a (static) object file. If not set, then [1613]$CXXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed. See also [1614]$SHCXXCOMSTR for
          compiling to shared objects.

env = Environment(CXXCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C++ source files. This is used by the internal
          CXXFile builder when generating C++ files from Lex (.ll) or YACC
          (.yy) input files. The default suffix is .cc. SCons also treats
          files with the suffixes .cpp, .cxx, .c++, and .C++ as C++ files,
          and files with .mm suffixes as Objective-C++ files. On
          case-sensitive systems (Linux, UNIX, and other POSIX-alikes),
          SCons also treats .C (upper case) files as C++ files.

   CXXFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C++ compiler. By default,
          this includes the value of [1615]$CCFLAGS, so that setting
          $CCFLAGS affects both C and C++ compilation. If you want to add
          C++-specific flags, you must set or override the value of
          [1616]$CXXFLAGS. See also [1617]$SHCXXFLAGS for compiling to
          shared objects.

   CXXVERSION
          The version number of the C++ compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C++ compiler being used.

   DC
          The D compiler to use. See also [1618]$SHDC for compiling to
          shared objects.

   DCOM
          The command line used to compile a D file to an object file. Any
          options specified in the [1619]$DFLAGS construction variable is
          included on this command line. See also [1620]$SHDCOM for
          compiling to shared objects.

   DCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a D source file is compiled to
          a (static) object file. If not set, then [1621]$DCOM (the
          command line) is displayed. See also [1622]$SHDCOMSTR for
          compiling to shared objects.

   DDEBUG
          List of debug tags to enable when compiling.

   DDEBUGPREFIX
          DDEBUGPREFIX.

   DDEBUGSUFFIX
          DDEBUGSUFFIX.

   ENV
          The execution environment - a dictionary of environment
          variables used when SCons invokes external commands to build
          targets defined in this construction environment. When $ENV is
          passed to a command, all list values are assumed to be path
          lists and are joined using the search path separator. Any other
          non-string values are coerced to a string.

          Note that by default SCons does not propagate the environment in
          effect when you execute scons (the "shell environment") to the
          execution environment. This is so that builds will be guaranteed
          repeatable regardless of the environment variables set at the
          time scons is invoked. If you want to propagate a shell
          environment variable to the commands executed to build target
          files, you must do so explicitly. A common example is the system
          PATH environment variable, so that scons will find utilities the
          same way as the invoking shell (or other process):

import os
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})

          Although it is usually not recommended, you can propagate the
          entire shell environment in one go:

import os
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())

   ESCAPE
          A function that will be called to escape shell special
          characters in command lines. The function should take one
          argument: the command line string to escape; and should return
          the escaped command line.

   F03
          The Fortran 03 compiler. You should normally set the
          [1637]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [1638]$F03 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 03 files.

   F03COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 03 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1639]$F03COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 03 files. You should
          normally set the [1640]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F03COMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 03 source file is
          compiled to an object file. If not set, then [1641]$F03COM or
          [1642]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F03FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F03 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f03']

   F03FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 03
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [1643]$F03PATH. See [1644]$_F03INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1645]$F03FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 03 files. You should normally set the
          [1646]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F03INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 03 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [1647]$_F03INCFLAGS is created by appending [1648]$INCPREFIX and
          [1649]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1650]$F03PATH.

   F03PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 03 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1651]$F03FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1652]$F03PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          lookup a directory relative to the root of the source tree, use
          #: You only need to set [1653]$F03PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 03 files. You should normally
          set the [1654]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F03PATH='#/include')

          The directory lookup can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F03PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1655]$_F03INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [1656]$INCPREFIX and [1657]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [1658]$F03PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F03PATH directory list
          should include [1659]$_F03INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F03COM="my_compiler $_F03INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F03PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 03 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1660]$F03FLAGS and
          [1661]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [1662]$F03PPCOM if you need
          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 03
          files. You should normally set the [1663]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,
          which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F03PPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 03 source file is
          compiled to an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. If not set, then [1664]$F03PPCOM or
          [1665]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F03PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F03 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty.

          The Fortran 08 compiler. You should normally set the
          [1666]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [1667]$F08 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 08 files.

   F08COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 08 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1668]$F08COM if you need to

          automatically from [1672]$F08PATH. See [1673]$_F08INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1674]$F08FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 08 files. You should normally set the
          [1675]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F08INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 08 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of

          [1678]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1679]$F08PATH.

   F08PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 08 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1680]$F08FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1681]$F08PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          lookup a directory relative to the root of the source tree, use
          #: You only need to set [1682]$F08PATH if you need to define a

   F90FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F90 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f90']

   F90FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 90
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [1730]$F90PATH. See [1731]$_F90INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1732]$F90FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 90 files. You should normally set the
          [1733]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F90INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 90 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [1734]$_F90INCFLAGS is created by appending [1735]$INCPREFIX and
          [1736]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1737]$F90PATH.

   F90PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 90 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1738]$F90FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1739]$F90PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          lookup a directory relative to the root of the source tree, use
          #: You only need to set [1740]$F90PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 90 files. You should normally
          set the [1741]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F90PATH='#/include')

          The directory lookup can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F90PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1742]$_F90INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [1743]$INCPREFIX and [1744]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [1745]$F90PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F90PATH directory list
          should include [1746]$_F90INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F90COM="my_compiler $_F90INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F90PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 90 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1747]$F90FLAGS and
          [1748]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [1749]$F90PPCOM if you need
          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 90
          files. You should normally set the [1750]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,
          which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F90PPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 90 source file is
          compiled after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. If not set, then [1751]$F90PPCOM or
          [1752]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F90PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F90 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty.

   F95
          The Fortran 95 compiler. You should normally set the
          [1753]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [1754]$F95 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 95 files.

   F95COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 95 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1755]$F95COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 95 files. You should
          normally set the [1756]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F95COMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is
          compiled to an object file. If not set, then [1757]$F95COM or
          [1758]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F95FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F95 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f95']

   F95FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 95
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [1759]$F95PATH. See [1760]$_F95INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1761]$F95FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 95 files. You should normally set the
          [1762]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F95INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 95 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [1763]$_F95INCFLAGS is created by appending [1764]$INCPREFIX and
          [1765]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1766]$F95PATH.

   F95PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 95 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1767]$F95FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1768]$F95PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          lookup a directory relative to the root of the source tree, use
          #: You only need to set [1769]$F95PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 95 files. You should normally
          set the [1770]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F95PATH='#/include')

          The directory lookup can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F95PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1771]$_F95INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [1772]$INCPREFIX and [1773]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [1774]$F95PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F95PATH directory list
          should include [1775]$_F95INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F95COM="my_compiler $_F95INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F95PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 95 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1776]$F95FLAGS and
          [1777]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [1778]$F95PPCOM if you need
          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 95
          files. You should normally set the [1779]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,
          which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F95PPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is
          compiled to an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. If not set, then [1780]$F95PPCOM or
          [1781]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F95PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F95 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty.

   File
          A function that converts a string into a File instance relative
          to the target being built.

   FILE_ENCODING
          File encoding used for files written by [1782]Textfile and
          [1783]Substfile. Set to "utf-8" by default.

          New in version 4.5.0.

   FORTRAN
          The default Fortran compiler for all versions of Fortran.

   FORTRANCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file. By default, any options specified in the
          [1784]$FORTRANFLAGS, [1785]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and
          [1786]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction variables are included on
          this command line.

   FORTRANCOMMONFLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran
          compiler. Similar to [1787]$FORTRANFLAGS, but this construction
          variable is applied to all dialects.

          New in version 4.4.

   FORTRANCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran source file is
          compiled to an object file. If not set, then [1788]$FORTRANCOM
          (the command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the FORTRAN dialect will
          be used. By default, this is ['.f', '.for', '.ftn']

   FORTRANFLAGS
          General user-specified options for the FORTRAN dialect that are
          passed to the Fortran compiler. Note that this variable does not
          contain -I (or similar) include or module search path options
          that scons generates automatically from [1789]$FORTRANPATH. See
          [1790]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS and [1791]$_FORTRANMODFLAG for the
          construction variables that expand those options.

   _FORTRANINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files and module files. The value of
          [1792]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS is created by respectively prepending
          and appending [1793]$INCPREFIX and [1794]$INCSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each directory in [1795]$FORTRANPATH.

   FORTRANMODDIR
          Directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files it generates. This variable is empty, by default.
          Some Fortran compilers will internally append this directory in
          the search path for module files, as well.

   FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be prepended to the beginning
          of the directory in the [1796]$FORTRANMODDIR construction
          variables when the [1797]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is
          automatically generated.

   FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of the
          directory in the [1798]$FORTRANMODDIR construction variables
          when the [1799]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is automatically
          generated.

   _FORTRANMODFLAG
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line option for specifying the
          directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files that happen to get generated during compilation.
          The value of [1800]$_FORTRANMODFLAG is created by respectively
          prepending and appending [1801]$FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX and
          [1802]$FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and end of the
          directory in [1803]$FORTRANMODDIR.

   FORTRANMODPREFIX
          The module file prefix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is left empty, by default. For situations
          in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal
          convention, the user may use this variable. Its value will be
          appended to every module file name as scons attempts to resolve
          dependencies.

   FORTRANMODSUFFIX
          The module file suffix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is set to ".mod", by default. For
          situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the
          normal convention, the user may use this variable. Its value
          will be appended to every module file name as scons attempts to
          resolve dependencies.

   FORTRANPATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran compiler will search
          for include files and (for some compilers) module files. The
          Fortran implicit dependency scanner will search these
          directories for include files (but not module files since they
          are autogenerated and, as such, may not actually exist at the
          time the scan takes place). Don't explicitly put include
          directory arguments in FORTRANFLAGS because the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. Note: directory names in FORTRANPATH will be
          looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are
          used in a command. To force scons to lookup a directory relative
          to the root of the source tree, use #:

env = Environment(FORTRANPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(FORTRANPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1804]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and
          appending the values of the [1805]$INCPREFIX and
          [1806]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end
          of each directory in [1807]$FORTRANPATH. Any command lines you
          define that need the FORTRANPATH directory list should include
          [1808]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(FORTRANCOM="my_compiler $_FORTRANINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURC
E")

   FORTRANPPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. By default, any options specified in the
          [1809]$FORTRANFLAGS, [1810]$CPPFLAGS, [1811]$_CPPDEFFLAGS,
          [1812]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and [1813]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variables are included on this command line.

   FORTRANPPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran source file is
          compiled to an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. If not set, then [1814]$FORTRANPPCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANPPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for FORTRAN dialect will be used. By default,
          this is ['.fpp', '.FPP']

   FORTRANSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for Fortran
          implicit dependencies (INCLUDE lines and USE statements). The
          default list is:

[".f", ".F", ".for", ".FOR", ".ftn", ".FTN", ".fpp", ".FPP",
".f77", ".F77", ".f90", ".F90", ".f95", ".F95"]

   FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list containing the paths to search for
          frameworks. Used by the compiler to find framework-style
          includes like #include <Fmwk/Header.h>. Used by the linker to
          find user-specified frameworks when linking (see
          [1815]$FRAMEWORKS). For example:

env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKPATH='#myframeworkdir')

          will add

... -Fmyframeworkdir

          to the compiler and linker command lines.

   _FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options
          corresponding to [1816]$FRAMEWORKPATH.

   FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for the
          FRAMEWORKPATH entries. (see [1817]$FRAMEWORKPATH). The default
          value is -F.

   FRAMEWORKPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for linking in
          frameworks (see [1818]$FRAMEWORKS). The default value is
          -framework.

   FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list of the framework names to be linked
          into a program or shared library or bundle. The default value is
          the empty list. For example:

env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKS=Split('System Cocoa SystemConfiguration'))

   _FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options for linking
          with FRAMEWORKS.

   FRAMEWORKSFLAGS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, general user-supplied frameworks options
          to be added at the end of a command line building a loadable
          module. (This has been largely superseded by the
          [1819]$FRAMEWORKPATH, [1820]$FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX,
          [1821]$FRAMEWORKPREFIX and [1822]$FRAMEWORKS variables described
          above.)

   GS
          The Ghostscript program used to, for example, convert PostScript
          to PDF files.

   GSCOM
          The full Ghostscript command line used for the conversion
          process. Its default value is "$GS $GSFLAGS -sOutputFile=$TARGET
          $SOURCES".

   GSCOMSTR
          The string displayed when Ghostscript is called for the
          conversion process. If this is not set (the default), then
          [1823]$GSCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   GSFLAGS
          General options passed to the Ghostscript program, when
          converting PostScript to PDF files for example. Its default
          value is "-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite"

   HOST_ARCH
          The name of the host hardware architecture used to create this
          construction environment. The platform code sets this when
          initializing (see [1824]$PLATFORM and the platform argument to
          [1825]Environment). Note the detected name of the architecture
          may not be identical to that returned by the Python
          platform.machine method.

          On the win32 platform, if the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is
          available, [1826]msvc tool setup is done using $HOST_ARCH and
          [1827]$TARGET_ARCH. Changing the values at any later time will
          not cause the tool to be reinitialized. Valid host arch values
          are x86 and arm for 32-bit hosts and amd64, arm64, and x86_64
          for 64-bit hosts.

          Should be considered immutable. $HOST_ARCH is not currently used
          by other platforms, but the option is reserved to do so in
          future

   HOST_OS
          The name of the host operating system for the platform used to
          create this construction environment. The platform code sets
          this when initializing (see [1828]$PLATFORM and the platform
          argument to [1829]Environment).

          Should be considered immutable. $HOST_OS is not currently used
          by SCons, but the option is reserved to do so in future

   IDLSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for IDL
          implicit dependencies (#include or import lines). The default
          list is:

[".idl", ".IDL"]

   IMPLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          Used to override
          [1830]$SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS/[1831]$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          when creating versioned import library for a shared
          library/loadable module. If not defined, then
          [1832]$SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS/[1833]$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          is used to determine whether to disable symlink generation or
          not.

   IMPLIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for import library names. For example, cygwin
          uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in pair with dynamic
          libraries (cygfoo.dll). The [1834]cyglink linker sets
          [1835]$IMPLIBPREFIX to 'lib' and [1836]$SHLIBPREFIX to 'cyg'.

   IMPLIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for import library names. For example, cygwin
          uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in pair with dynamic
          libraries (cygfoo.dll). The [1837]cyglink linker sets
          [1838]$IMPLIBSUFFIX to '.dll.a' and [1839]$SHLIBSUFFIX to
          '.dll'.

   IMPLIBVERSION
          Used to override [1840]$SHLIBVERSION/[1841]$LDMODULEVERSION when
          generating versioned import library for a shared
          library/loadable module. If undefined, the
          [1842]$SHLIBVERSION/[1843]$LDMODULEVERSION is used to determine
          the version of versioned import library.

   IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES
          Controls whether or not SCons will add implicit dependencies for
          the commands executed to build targets.

          By default, SCons will add to each target an implicit dependency
          on the command represented by the first argument of any command
          line it executes (which is typically the command itself). By
          setting such a dependency, SCons can determine that a target
          should be rebuilt if the command changes, such as when a
          compiler is upgraded to a new version. The specific file for the
          dependency is found by searching the PATH variable in the ENV
          dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the
          command. The default is the same as setting the construction
          variable $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES to a True-like value
          ("true", "yes", or "1" - but not a number greater than one, as
          that has a different meaning).

          Action strings can be segmented by the use of an AND operator,
          &&. In a segmented string, each segment is a separate "command
          line", these are run sequentially until one fails, or the entire
          sequence has been executed. If an action string is segmented,
          then the selected behavior of $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is
          applied to each segment.

          If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to a False-like value
          ("none", "false", "no", "0", etc.), then the implicit dependency
          will not be added to the targets built with that construction
          environment.

          If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to "2" or higher, then
          that number of arguments in the command line will be scanned for
          relative or absolute paths. If any are present, they will be
          added as implicit dependencies to the targets built with that
          construction environment. The first argument in the command line
          will be searched for using the PATH variable in the ENV
          dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the
          command. The other arguments will only be found if they are
          absolute paths or valid paths relative to the working directory.

          If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to "all", then all
          arguments in the command line will be scanned for relative or
          absolute paths. If any are present, they will be added as
          implicit dependencies to the targets built with that
          construction environment. The first argument in the command line
          will be searched for using the PATH variable in the ENV
          dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the
          command. The other arguments will only be found if they are
          absolute paths or valid paths relative to the working directory.

env = Environment(IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES=False)

   INCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be prepended to each directory
          in the [1844]$CPPPATH and [1845]$FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the [1846]$_CPPINCFLAGS and
          [1847]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables are automatically generated.

   INCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to each directory
          in the [1848]$CPPPATH and [1849]$FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the [1850]$_CPPINCFLAGS and
          [1851]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables are automatically generated.

   INSTALL
          A function to be called to install a file into a destination
          file name. The default function copies the file into the
          destination (and sets the destination file's mode and permission
          bits to match the source file's). The function takes the
          following arguments:

def install(dest, source, env):

          dest is the path name of the destination file. source is the
          path name of the source file. env is the construction
          environment (a dictionary of construction values) in force for
          this file installation.

   INSTALLSTR
          The string displayed when a file is installed into a destination
          file name. The default is:

Install file: "$SOURCE" as "$TARGET"

   INTEL_C_COMPILER_VERSION
          Set by the [1852]intelc Tool to the major version number of the
          Intel C compiler selected for use.

   JAR
          The Java archive tool.

   JARCHDIR
          The directory to which the Java archive tool should change
          (using the -C option).

   JARCOM
          The command line used to call the Java archive tool.

   JARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when the Java archive tool is called If
          this is not set, then [1853]$JARCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

env = Environment(JARCOMSTR="JARchiving $SOURCES into $TARGET")

   JARFLAGS
          General options passed to the Java archive tool. By default,
          this is set to cf to create the necessary jar file.

   JARSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java archives: .jar by default.

   JAVABOOTCLASSPATH
          Specifies the location of the bootstrap class files. Can be
          specified as a string or Node object, or as a list of strings or
          Node objects.

          The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the
          -bootclasspath option, which requires a system-specific search
          path separator. This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it
          constructs the command line if $JAVABOOTCLASSPATH is provided in
          list form. If $JAVABOOTCLASSPATH is a single string containing
          search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for
          Windows), it will not be modified; and so is inherently
          system-specific; to supply the path in a system-independent
          manner, give $JAVABOOTCLASSPATH as a list of paths instead.

Note

          Can only be used when compiling for releases prior to JDK 9.

   JAVAC
          The Java compiler.

   JAVACCOM
          The command line used to compile a directory tree containing
          Java source files to corresponding Java class files. Any options
          specified in the [1854]$JAVACFLAGS construction variable are
          included on this command line.

   JAVACCOMSTR
          The string displayed when compiling a directory tree of Java
          source files to corresponding Java class files. If this is not
          set, then [1855]$JAVACCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVACCOMSTR="Compiling class files $TARGETS from $SOURCES")

   JAVACFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the Java compiler.

   JAVACLASSDIR
          The directory in which Java class files may be found. This is
          stripped from the beginning of any Java .class file names
          supplied to the [1856]JavaH builder.

   JAVACLASSPATH
          Specifies the class search path for the JDK tools. Can be
          specified as a string or Node object, or as a list of strings or
          Node objects. Class path entries may be directory names to
          search for class files or packages, pathnames to archives (.jar
          or .zip) containing classes, or paths ending in a "base name
          wildcard" character (*), which matches files in that directory
          with a .jar suffix. See the Java documentation for more details.

          The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the
          -classpath option, which requires a system-specific search path
          separator. This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it
          constructs the command line if $JAVACLASSPATH is provided in
          list form. If $JAVACLASSPATH is a single string containing
          search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for
          Windows), it will be split on the separator into a list of
          individual paths for dependency scanning purposes. It will not
          be modified for JDK command-line usage, so such a string is
          inherently system-specific; to supply the path in a
          system-independent manner, give $JAVACLASSPATH as a list of
          paths instead.

Note

          SCons always supplies a -sourcepath when invoking the Java
          compiler javac, regardless of the setting of
          [1857]$JAVASOURCEPATH, as it passes the path(s) to the source(s)
          supplied in the call to the [1858]Java builder via -sourcepath .
          From the documentation of the standard Java toolkit for javac:
          "If not compiling code for modules, if the --source-path or
          -sourcepath option is not specified, then the user class path is
          also searched for source files." Since -sourcepath is always
          supplied, javac will not use the contents of the value of
          $JAVACLASSPATH when searching for sources.

   JAVACLASSSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java class files; .class by default.

   JAVAH
          The Java generator for C header and stub files.

   JAVAHCOM
          The command line used to generate C header and stub files from
          Java classes. Any options specified in the [1859]$JAVAHFLAGS
          construction variable are included on this command line.

   JAVAHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when C header and stub files are generated
          from Java classes. If this is not set, then [1860]$JAVAHCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVAHCOMSTR="Generating header/stub file(s) $TARGETS from $SOU
RCES")

   JAVAHFLAGS
          General options passed to the C header and stub file generator
          for Java classes.

   JAVAINCLUDES
          Include path for Java header files (such as jni.h).

   JAVAPROCESSORPATH
          Specifies the location of the annotation processor class files.
          Can be specified as a string or Node object, or as a list of
          strings or Node objects.

          The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the
          -processorpath option, which requires a system-specific search
          path separator. This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it
          constructs the command line if $JAVAPROCESSORPATH is provided in
          list form. If $JAVAPROCESSORPATH is a single string containing
          search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for
          Windows), it will not be modified; and so is inherently
          system-specific; to supply the path in a system-independent
          manner, give $JAVAPROCESSORPATH as a list of paths instead.

          New in version 4.5.0

   JAVASOURCEPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for
          input (source) .java files. Can be specified as a string or Node
          object, or as a list of strings or Node objects.

          The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the
          -sourcepath option, which requires a system-specific search path
          separator, This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it
          constructs the command line if $JAVASOURCEPATH is provided in
          list form. If $JAVASOURCEPATH is a single string containing
          search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for
          Windows), it will not be modified, and so is inherently
          system-specific; to supply the path in a system-independent
          manner, give $JAVASOURCEPATH as a list of paths instead.

          Note that the specified directories are only added to the
          command line via the -sourcepath option. SCons does not
          currently search the $JAVASOURCEPATH directories for dependent
          .java files.

   JAVASUFFIX
          The suffix for Java files; .java by default.

   JAVAVERSION
          Specifies the Java version being used by the [1861]Java builder.
          Set this to specify the version of Java targeted by the javac
          compiler. This is sometimes necessary because Java 1.5 changed
          the file names that are created for nested anonymous inner
          classes, which can cause a mismatch with the files that SCons
          expects will be generated by the javac compiler. Setting
          $JAVAVERSION to a version greater than 1.4 makes SCons realize
          that a build with such a compiler is actually up-to-date. The
          default is 1.4.

          While this is not primarily intended for selecting one version
          of the Java compiler vs. another, it does have that effect on
          the Windows platform. A more precise approach is to set
          [1862]$JAVAC (and related construction variables for related
          utilities) to the path to the specific Java compiler you want,
          if that is not the default compiler. On non-Windows platforms,
          the alternatives system may provide a way to adjust the default
          Java compiler without having to specify explicit paths.

   LATEX
          The LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   LATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter. If this is not set, then [1863]$LATEXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LATEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES")

   LATEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXRETRIES
          The maximum number of times that LaTeX will be re-run if the
          .log generated by the [1864]$LATEXCOM command indicates that
          there are undefined references. The default is to try to resolve
          undefined references by re-running LaTeX up to three times.

   LATEXSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for LaTeX
          implicit dependencies (\include or \import files). The default
          list is:

[".tex", ".ltx", ".latex"]

   LDMODULE
          The linker for building loadable modules. By default, this is
          the same as [1865]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOM
          The command line for building loadable modules. On Mac OS X,
          this uses the [1866]$LDMODULE, [1867]$LDMODULEFLAGS and
          [1868]$FRAMEWORKSFLAGS variables. On other systems, this is the
          same as [1869]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when building loadable modules. If
          not set, then [1870]$LDMODULECOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   LDMODULEEMITTER
          Contains the emitter specification for the [1871]LoadableModule
          builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general
          information on specifying emitters.

   LDMODULEFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker for building loadable
          modules.

   LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          Instructs the [1872]LoadableModule builder to not automatically
          create symlinks for versioned modules. Defaults to
          $SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS

   LDMODULEPREFIX
          The prefix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          [1873]$SHLIBPREFIX.

   _LDMODULESONAME
          A macro that automatically generates loadable module's SONAME
          based on $TARGET, $LDMODULEVERSION and $LDMODULESUFFIX. Used by
          [1874]LoadableModule builder when the linker tool supports
          SONAME (e.g. [1875]gnulink).

   LDMODULESUFFIX
          The suffix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          $SHLIBSUFFIX.

   LDMODULEVERSION
          When this construction variable is defined, a versioned loadable
          module is created by [1876]LoadableModule builder. This
          activates the [1877]$_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS and thus modifies the
          [1878]$LDMODULECOM as required, adds the version number to the
          library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed.
          [1879]$LDMODULEVERSION versions should exist in the same format
          as [1880]$SHLIBVERSION.

   _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          This macro automatically introduces extra flags to
          [1881]$LDMODULECOM when building versioned [1882]LoadableModule
          (that is when [1883]$LDMODULEVERSION is set).
          _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS usually adds [1884]$SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and
          some extra dynamically generated options (such as
          -Wl,-soname=$_LDMODULESONAME). It is unused by plain
          (unversioned) loadable modules.

   LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          Extra flags added to [1885]$LDMODULECOM when building versioned
          [1886]LoadableModule. These flags are only used when
          [1887]$LDMODULEVERSION is set.

   LEX
          The lexical analyzer generator.

   LEX_HEADER_FILE
          If supplied, generate a C header file with the name taken from
          this variable. Will be emitted as a --header-file= command-line
          option. Use this in preference to including --header-file= in
          [1888]$LEXFLAGS directly.

   LEX_TABLES_FILE
          If supplied, write the lex tables to a file with the name taken
          from this variable. Will be emitted as a --tables-file=
          command-line option. Use this in preference to including
          --tables-file= in [1889]$LEXFLAGS directly.

   LEXCOM
          The command line used to call the lexical analyzer generator to
          generate a source file.

   LEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          lexical analyzer generator. If this is not set, then
          [1890]$LEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LEXCOMSTR="Lex'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   LEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the lexical analyzer generator. In
          addition to passing the value on during invocation, the
          [1891]lex tool also examines this construction variable for
          options which cause additional output files to be generated, and
          adds those to the target list. Recognized for this purpose are
          GNU flex options --header-file= and --tables-file=; the output
          file is named by the option argument.

          Note that files specified by --header-file= and --tables-file=
          may not be properly handled by SCons in all situations. Consider
          using [1892]$LEX_HEADER_FILE and [1893]$LEX_TABLES_FILE instead.

   LEXUNISTD
          Used only in Windows environments to set a lex flag to prevent
          'unistd.h' from being included. The default value is
          '--nounistd'.

   _LIBDIRFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for library. The value of $_LIBDIRFLAGS is created by
          respectively prepending and appending [1894]$LIBDIRPREFIX and
          [1895]$LIBDIRSUFFIX to each directory in [1896]$LIBPATH.

   LIBDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be prepended to each directory in the
          [1897]$LIBPATH construction variable when the
          [1898]$_LIBDIRFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   LIBDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to each directory in the
          [1899]$LIBPATH construction variable when the
          [1900]$_LIBDIRFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   LIBEMITTER
          Contains the emitter specification for the [1901]StaticLibrary
          builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general
          information on specifying emitters.

   _LIBFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying libraries to be
          linked with the resulting target. The value of $_LIBFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending
          [1902]$LIBLINKPREFIX and [1903]$LIBLINKSUFFIX to each filename
          in [1904]$LIBS.

   LIBLINKPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be prepended to each library in the
          [1905]$LIBS construction variable when the [1906]$_LIBFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBLINKSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to each library in the
          [1907]$LIBS construction variable when the [1908]$_LIBFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBLITERALPREFIX
          If the linker supports command line syntax directing that the
          argument specifying a library should be searched for literally
          (without modification), $LIBLITERALPREFIX can be set to that
          indicator. For example, the GNU linker follows this rule: "
          -l:foo searches the library path for a filename called foo,
          without converting it to libfoo.so or libfoo.a. " If
          $LIBLITERALPREFIX is set, SCons will not transform a
          string-valued entry in [1909]$LIBS that starts with that string.
          The entry will still be surrounded with [1910]$LIBLINKPREFIX and
          [1911]$LIBLINKSUFFIX on the command line. This is useful, for
          example, in directing that a static library be used when both a
          static and dynamic library are available and linker policy is to
          prefer dynamic libraries. Compared to the example in
          [1912]$LIBS,

env.Append(LIBS=":libmylib.a")

          will let the linker select that specific (static) library name
          if found in the library search path. This differs from using a
          File object to specify the static library, as the latter
          bypasses the library search path entirely.

   LIBPATH
          The list of directories that will be searched for libraries
          specified by the [1913]$LIBS construction variable. $LIBPATH
          should be a list of path strings, or a single string, not a
          pathname list joined by Python's os.pathsep. Do not put library
          search directives directly into $LINKFLAGS or $SHLINKFLAGS as
          the result will be non-portable.

          Note: directory names in $LIBPATH will be looked-up relative to
          the directory of the SConscript file when they are used in a
          command. To force scons to lookup a directory relative to the
          root of the source tree, use the # prefix:

env = Environment(LIBPATH='#/libs')

          The directory lookup can also be forced using the [1914]Dir
          function:

libs = Dir('libs')
env = Environment(LIBPATH=libs)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1915]$_LIBDIRFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and
          appending the values of the [1916]$LIBDIRPREFIX and
          [1917]$LIBDIRSUFFIX construction variables to each directory in
          $LIBPATH. Any command lines you define that need the $LIBPATH
          directory list should include $_LIBDIRFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

   LIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBPREFIXES
          A list of all legal prefixes for library file names on the
          current platform. When searching for library dependencies, SCons
          will look for files with these prefixes, the base library name,
          and suffixes from the [1918]$LIBSUFFIXES list.

   LIBS
          The list of libraries that will be added to the link line for
          linking with any executable program, shared library, or loadable
          module created by the construction environment or override.

          For portability, a string-valued library name should include
          only the base library name, without prefixes such as lib or
          suffixes such as .so or .dll. SCons will attempt to strip
          prefixes from the [1919]$LIBPREFIXES list and suffixes from the
          [1920]$LIBSUFFIXES list, but depending on that behavior will
          make the build less portable: for example, on a POSIX system, no
          attempt will be made to strip a suffix like .dll. Library name
          strings in $LIBS should not include a path component: instead
          use [1921]$LIBPATH to direct the compiler to look for libraries
          in those paths, plus any default paths the linker searches in.
          If [1922]$LIBLITERALPREFIX is set to a non-empty string, then a
          string-valued $LIBS entry that starts with
          [1923]$LIBLITERALPREFIX will cause the rest of the entry to be
          searched for unmodified, but respecting normal library search
          paths (this is an exception to the guideline above about leaving
          off the prefix/suffix from the library name).

          If a $LIBS entry is a Node object (either as returned by a
          previous Builder call, or as the result of an explicit call to
          [1924]File), the pathname from that Node will be added to
          $_LIBFLAGS, and thus to the link line, unmodified - without
          adding $LIBLINKPREFIX or $LIBLINKSUFFIX. Such entries are
          searched for literally (including any path component); the
          library search paths are not used. For example:

env.Append(LIBS=File('/tmp/mylib.so'))

          For each Builder call that causes linking with libraries, SCons
          will add the libraries in the setting of $LIBS in effect at that
          moment to the dependency graph as dependencies of the target
          being generated.

          The library list will be transformed to command-line arguments
          through the automatically-generated [1925]$_LIBFLAGS
          construction variable which is constructed by respectively
          prepending and appending the values of the [1926]$LIBLINKPREFIX
          and [1927]$LIBLINKSUFFIX construction variables to each library
          name.

          Any command lines you define yourself that need the libraries
          from $LIBS should include $_LIBFLAGS (as well as
          [1928]$_LIBDIRFLAGS) rather than $LIBS. For example:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

   LIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBSUFFIXES
          A list of all legal suffixes for library file names. on the
          current platform. When searching for library dependencies, SCons
          will look for files with prefixes from the [1929]$LIBPREFIXES
          list, the base library name, and these suffixes.

   LICENSE
          The abbreviated name, preferably the SPDX code, of the license
          under which this project is released (GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1,
          BSD-2-Clause etc.). See

          of license names and SPDX codes.

          See the [1931]Package builder.

   LINESEPARATOR
          The separator used by the [1932]Substfile and [1933]Textfile
          builders. This value is used between sources when constructing
          the target. It defaults to the current system line separator.

   LINGUAS_FILE
          The $LINGUAS_FILE defines file(s) containing list of additional
          linguas to be processed by [1934]POInit, [1935]POUpdate or
          [1936]MOFiles builders. It also affects [1937]Translate builder.
          If the variable contains a string, it defines the name of the
          list file. The $LINGUAS_FILE may be a list of file names as
          well. If $LINGUAS_FILE is set to a non-string truthy value, the
          list will be read from the file named LINGUAS.

   LINK
          The linker. See also [1938]$SHLINK for linking shared objects.

          On POSIX systems (those using the [1939]link tool), you should
          normally not change this value as it defaults to a "smart"
          linker tool which selects a compiler driver matching the type of
          source files in use. So for example, if you set [1940]$CXX to a
          specific compiler name, and are compiling C++ sources, the
          smartlink function will automatically select the same compiler
          for linking.

   LINKCOM
          The command line used to link object files into an executable.
          See also [1941]$SHLINKCOM for linking shared objects.

          If set, the string displayed when object files are linked into
          an executable. If not set, then [1942]$LINKCOM (the command
          line) is displayed. See also [1943]$SHLINKCOMSTR. for linking
          shared objects.

env = Environment(LINKCOMSTR = "Linking $TARGET")

   LINKFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker. Note that this
          variable should not contain -l (or similar) options for linking
          with the libraries listed in [1944]$LIBS, nor -L (or similar)
          library search path options that scons generates automatically
          from [1945]$LIBPATH. See [1946]$_LIBFLAGS above, for the
          variable that expands to library-link options, and
          [1947]$_LIBDIRFLAGS above, for the variable that expands to
          library search path options. See also [1948]$SHLINKFLAGS. for
          linking shared objects.

          [1950]$MAKEINDEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   MAKEINDEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the makeindex generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   MSSDK_DIR
          The directory containing the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK
          or Windows SDK) to be used for compilation.

   MSSDK_VERSION
          The version string of the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK or
          Windows SDK) to be used for compilation. Supported versions
          include 6.1, 6.0A, 6.0, 2003R2 and 2003R1.

   MSVC_BATCH
          When set to any true value, specifies that SCons should batch
          compilation of object files when calling the Microsoft Visual
          C++ compiler. All compilations of source files from the same
          source directory that generate target files in a same output
          directory and were configured in SCons using the same
          construction environment will be built in a single call to the
          compiler. Only source files that have changed since their object
          files were built will be passed to each compiler invocation (via
          the [1984]$CHANGED_SOURCES construction variable). Any
          compilations where the object (target) file base name (minus the
          .obj) does not match the source file base name will be compiled
          separately.

   MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY
          Specify the scons behavior when the Microsoft Visual C++
          compiler is not detected.

          The $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY specifies the scons behavior when no
          msvc versions are detected or when the requested msvc version is
          not detected.

          The valid values for $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY and the corresponding
          scons behavior are:

        'Error' or 'Exception'
                Raise an exception when no msvc versions are detected or
                when the requested msvc version is not detected.

        'Warning' or 'Warn'
                Issue a warning and continue when no msvc versions are
                detected or when the requested msvc version is not
                detected. Depending on usage, this could result in build
                failure(s).

        'Ignore' or 'Suppress'
                Take no action and continue when no msvc versions are
                detected or when the requested msvc version is not
                detected. Depending on usage, this could result in build
                failure(s).

          Note: in addition to the camel case values shown above, lower
          case and upper case values are accepted as well.

          The $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY is applied when any of the following
          conditions are satisfied:

          + $MSVC_VERSION is specified, the default tools list is
            implicitly defined (i.e., the tools list is not specified),
            and the default tools list contains one or more of the msvc
            tools.
          + $MSVC_VERSION is specified, the default tools list is
            explicitly specified (e.g., tools=['default']), and the
            default tools list contains one or more of the msvc tools.
          + A non-default tools list is specified that contains one or
            more of the msvc tools (e.g., tools=['msvc', 'mslink']).

          The $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY is ignored when any of the following
          conditions are satisfied:

          + $MSVC_VERSION is not specified and the default tools list is
            implicitly defined (i.e., the tools list is not specified).
          + $MSVC_VERSION is not specified and the default tools list is
            explicitly specified (e.g., tools=['default']).
          + A non-default tool list is specified that does not contain any
            of the msvc tools (e.g., tools=['mingw']).

          Important usage details:

          + $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY must be passed as an argument to the
            [1985]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
            [1986]msvc, [1987]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools
            list or via a tools list passed to the [1988]Environment
            constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY must be set
            before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.

          When $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY is not specified, the default scons
          behavior is to issue a warning and continue subject to the
          conditions listed above. The default scons behavior may change
          in the future.

          New in version 4.4

   MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS
          Pass user-defined arguments to the Microsoft Visual C++ batch
          file determined via autodetection.

          $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS is available for msvc batch file arguments
          that do not have first-class support via construction variables
          or when there is an issue with the appropriate construction
          variable validation. When available, it is recommended to use
          the appropriate construction variables (e.g.,
          [1989]$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION) rather than $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS
          arguments.

          The valid values for $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are: None, a string, or a
          list of strings.

          The $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS value is converted to a scalar string
          (i.e., "flattened"). The resulting scalar string, if not empty,
          is passed as an argument to the msvc batch file determined via
          autodetection subject to the validation conditions listed below.

          $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS is ignored when the value is None and when the
          result from argument conversion is an empty string. The
          validation conditions below do not apply.

          An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are
          satisfied:

          + $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS is specified for Visual Studio 2013 and
            earlier.
          + Multiple SDK version arguments (e.g., '10.0.20348.0') are
            specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.
          + [1990]$MSVC_SDK_VERSION is specified and an SDK version
            argument (e.g., '10.0.20348.0') is specified in
            $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple SDK version declarations via
            [1991]$MSVC_SDK_VERSION and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.
          + Multiple toolset version arguments (e.g., '-vcvars_ver=14.29')
            are specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.
          + [1992]$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified and a toolset version
            argument (e.g., '-vcvars_ver=14.29') is specified in
            $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple toolset version declarations via
            [1993]$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not
            allowed.
          + Multiple spectre library arguments (e.g.,
            '-vcvars_spectre_libs=spectre') are specified in
            $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.
          + [1994]$MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled and a spectre library
            argument (e.g., '-vcvars_spectre_libs=spectre') is specified
            in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple spectre library declarations
            via [1995]$MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not
            allowed.
          + Multiple UWP arguments (e.g., uwp or store) are specified in
            $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.
          + [1996]$MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled and a UWP argument (e.g., uwp
            or store) is specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple UWP
            declarations via [1997]$MSVC_UWP_APP and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are
            not allowed.

          Example 1 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with an SDK version and a
          toolset version specified with a string argument:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS='10.0.20348.0 -vcvars_ve
r=14.29.30133')

   MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY
          Specify the scons behavior when Microsoft Visual C++ batch file
          errors are detected.

          The $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY specifies the scons behavior when
          msvc batch file errors are detected. When
          $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY is not specified, the default scons
          behavior is to suppress msvc batch file error messages.

          The root cause of msvc build failures may be difficult to
          diagnose. In these situations, setting the scons behavior to
          issue a warning when msvc batch file errors are detected may
          produce additional diagnostic information.

          The valid values for $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY and the
          corresponding scons behavior are:

        'Error' or 'Exception'
                Raise an exception when msvc batch file errors are
                detected.

        'Warning' or 'Warn'
                Issue a warning when msvc batch file errors are detected.

        'Ignore' or 'Suppress'
                Suppress msvc batch file error messages.

   MSVC_USE_SCRIPT
          Use a batch script to set up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

          If set to the name of a Visual Studio .bat file (e.g.
          vcvars.bat), SCons will run that batch file instead of the
          auto-detected one, and extract the relevant variables from the
          result (typically %INCLUDE%, %LIB%, and %PATH%) for supplying to
          the build. This can be useful to force the use of a compiler
          version that SCons does not detect. [2028]$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS
          provides arguments passed to this script.

          Setting $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT to None bypasses the Visual Studio
          autodetection entirely; use this if you are running SCons in a
          Visual Studio cmd window and importing the shell's environment
          variables - that is, if you are sure everything is set correctly
          already and you don't want SCons to change anything.

          $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT ignores [2029]$MSVC_VERSION and
          [2030]$TARGET_ARCH.

          $MSVC_USE_SETTINGS is ignored when [2033]$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT is
          defined and/or when $MSVC_USE_SETTINGS is set to None.

          The dictionary is used to populate the environment with the
          relevant variables (typically %INCLUDE%, %LIB%, and %PATH%) for
          supplying to the build. This can be useful to force the use of a
          compiler environment that SCons does not configure correctly.
          This is an alternative to manually configuring the environment
          when bypassing Visual Studio autodetection entirely by setting
          [2034]$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT to None.

          Visual C++ environment will be set up to point to the Windows
          Store compatible libraries and Microsoft Visual C++ runtimes. In
          doing so, any libraries that are built will be able to be used
          in a UWP App and published to the Windows Store.

          An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are
          satisfied:

          + $MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled for Visual Studio 2013 and earlier.
          + $MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled and a UWP argument is specified in
            [2039]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple UWP declarations via
            $MSVC_UWP_APP and [2040]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.

          Example - A Visual Studio 2022 build for the Universal Windows
          Platform:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_UWP_APP=True)

          Important usage details:

          + $MSVC_UWP_APP must be passed as an argument to the
            [2041]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
            [2042]msvc, [2043]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools
            list or via a tools list passed to the [2044]Environment
            constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_UWP_APP must be set before the
            first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.
          + The existence of the UWP libraries is not verified when
            $MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled which could result in build failures.
            The burden is on the user to ensure the requisite UWP
            libraries are installed.

   MSVC_VERSION
          A string to select the preferred version of Microsoft Visual
          C++. If the specified version is unavailable and/or unknown to
          SCons, a warning is issued showing the versions actually
          discovered, and the build will eventually fail indicating a
          missing compiler binary. If $MSVC_VERSION is not set, SCons will
          (by default) select the latest version of Microsoft Visual C++
          installed on your system (excluding any preview versions).

Note

          In order to take effect, $MSVC_VERSION must be set before the
          initial Microsoft Visual C++ compiler discovery takes place.
          Discovery happens, at the latest, during the first call to the
          [2045]Environment function, unless a tools list is specified
          which excludes the entire Microsoft Visual C++ toolchain - that
          is, omits "defaults" and any specific tool module that refers to
          parts of the toolchain ([2046]msvc, [2047]mslink, [2048]masm,
          [2049]midl and [2050]msvs). In this case, detection is deferred
          until any one of those tool modules is invoked manually. The
          following two examples illustrate this:

# MSVC_VERSION set as Environment is created
env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.2')

# Initialization deferred with empty tools, triggered manually
env = Environment(tools=[])
env['MSVC_VERSION'] = '14.2
env.Tool('msvc')
env.Tool('mslink')
env.Tool('msvs')

          The valid values for $MSVC_VERSION represent major versions of
          the compiler, except that versions ending in Exp refer to
          "Express" or "Express for Desktop" Visual Studio editions.
          Values that do not look like a valid compiler version string are
          not supported.

          The following table shows the correspondence of $MSVC_VERSION
          values to various version indicators ('x' is used as a
          placeholder for a single digit that can vary).

Note

          + It is not necessary to install a Visual Studio IDE to build
            with SCons (for example, you can install only Build Tools),
            but when a Visual Studio IDE is installed, additional builders
            such as [2051]MSVSSolution and [2052]MSVSProject become
            available and correspond to the specified versions.
          + Versions ending in Exp refer to historical "Express" or
            "Express for Desktop" Visual Studio editions, which had
            feature limitations compared to the full editions. It is only
            necessary to specify the Exp suffix to select the express
            edition when both express and non-express editions of the same
            product are installed simultaneously. The Exp suffix is
            unnecessary, but accepted, when only the express edition is
            installed.

          The compilation environment can be further or more precisely
          specified through the use of several other construction
          variables: see the descriptions of [2053]$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION,
          [2054]$MSVC_SDK_VERSION, [2055]$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT,
          [2056]$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS, and [2057]$MSVC_USE_SETTINGS.

   MSVS
          When the Microsoft Visual Studio tools are initialized, they set
          up this dictionary with the following keys:

        VERSION
                the version of MSVS being used (can be set via
                [2058]$MSVC_VERSION)

        VERSIONS
                the available versions of MSVS installed

        VCINSTALLDIR
                installed directory of Microsoft Visual C++

        VSINSTALLDIR
                installed directory of Visual Studio

        FRAMEWORKDIR
                installed directory of the .NET framework

        FRAMEWORKVERSIONS
                list of installed versions of the .NET framework, sorted
                latest to oldest.

        FRAMEWORKVERSION
                latest installed version of the .NET framework

        FRAMEWORKSDKDIR
                installed location of the .NET SDK.

        PLATFORMSDKDIR
                installed location of the Platform SDK.

        PLATFORMSDK_MODULES
                dictionary of installed Platform SDK modules, where the
                dictionary keys are keywords for the various modules, and
                the values are 2-tuples where the first is the release
                date, and the second is the version number.

          If a value is not set, it was not available in the registry.
          Visual Studio 2017 and later do not use the registry for primary
          storage of this information, so typically for these versions
          only PROJECTSUFFIX and SOLUTIONSUFFIX will be set.

   MSVS_ARCH
          Sets the architecture for which the generated project(s) should
          build.

          The default value is x86. amd64 is also supported by SCons for
          most Visual Studio versions. Since Visual Studio 2015 arm is
          supported, and since Visual Studio 2017 arm64 is supported.
          Trying to set $MSVS_ARCH to an architecture that's not supported
          for a given Visual Studio version will generate an error.

   MSVS_PROJECT_GUID
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project
          file as the value of the ProjectGUID attribute. There is no
          default value. If not defined, a new GUID is generated.

   MSVS_SCC_AUX_PATH
          The path name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project
          file as the value of the SccAuxPath attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. There is no
          default value.

   MSVS_SCC_CONNECTION_ROOT
          The root path of projects in your SCC workspace, i.e the path
          under which all project and solution files will be generated. It
          is used as a reference path from which the relative paths of the
          generated Microsoft Visual C++ project and solution files are
          computed. The relative project file path is placed as the value
          of the SccLocalPath attribute of the project file and as the
          values of the SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection[i]
          (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of projects in the
          solution) attributes of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl)
          section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. Similarly,
          the relative solution file path is placed as the values of the
          SccLocalPath[i] (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of
          projects in the solution) attributes of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. This is used only if the MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER
          construction variable is also set. The default value is the
          current working directory.

   MSVS_SCC_PROJECT_NAME
          The project name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++
          project file as the value of the SccProjectName attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. In this
          case the string is also placed in the SccProjectName0 attribute
          of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft
          Visual Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project
          file as the value of the SccProvider attribute. The string is
          also placed in the SccProvider0 attribute of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_VERSION
          Set the preferred version of Microsoft Visual Studio to use.

          If $MSVS_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the
          latest version of Visual Studio installed on your system. So, if
          you have version 6 and version 7 (MSVS .NET) installed, it will
          prefer version 7. You can override this by specifying the
          [2059]$MSVS_VERSION variable when initializing the Environment,
          setting it to the appropriate version ('6.0' or '7.0', for
          example). If the specified version isn't installed, tool
          initialization will fail.

          Deprecated since 1.3.0: $MSVS_VERSION is deprecated in favor of
          [2060]$MSVC_VERSION. As a transitional aid, if $MSVS_VERSION is
          set and $MSVC_VERSION is not, $MSVC_VERSION will be initialized
          to the value of $MSVS_VERSION. An error is raised if both are
          set and have different values.

   MSVSBUILDCOM
          The build command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          C++ project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified build targets.

   MSVSCLEANCOM
          The clean command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          C++ project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with the -c option to remove any specified targets.

   MSVSENCODING
          The encoding string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++
          project file. The default is encoding Windows-1252.

   MSVSPROJECTCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual C++ project files.

   MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual C++ project (DSP) files.
          The default value is .vcxproj when using Visual Studio 2010 and
          later, .vcproj when using Visual Studio versions between 2002
          and 2008, and .dsp when using Visual Studio 6.0.

   MSVSREBUILDCOM
          The rebuild command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          C++ project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified rebuild targets.

   MSVSSCONS
          The SCons used in generated Microsoft Visual C++ project files.
          The default is the version of SCons being used to generate the
          project file.

   MSVSSCONSCOM
          The default SCons command used in generated Microsoft Visual C++
          project files.

   MSVSSCONSCRIPT
          The sconscript file (that is, SConstruct or SConscript file)
          that will be invoked by Microsoft Visual C++ project files
          (through the [2061]$MSVSSCONSCOM variable). The default is the
          same sconscript file that contains the call to [2062]MSVSProject
          to build the project file.

   MSVSSCONSFLAGS
          The SCons flags used in generated Microsoft Visual C++ project
          files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio solution
          files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio solution (DSW)
          files. The default value is .sln when using Visual Studio
          version 7.x (.NET 2002) and later, and .dsw when using Visual
          Studio 6.0.

   MT
          The program used on Windows systems to embed manifests into DLLs
          and EXEs. See also [2063]$WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST.

   MTEXECOM
          The Windows command line used to embed manifests into
          executables. See also [2064]$MTSHLIBCOM.

   MTFLAGS
          Flags passed to the [2065]$MT manifest embedding program
          (Windows only).

   MTSHLIBCOM
          The Windows command line used to embed manifests into shared
          libraries (DLLs). See also [2066]$MTEXECOM.

   MWCW_VERSION
          The version number of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C compiler to
          be used.

   MWCW_VERSIONS
          A list of installed versions of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C
          compiler on this system.

   NAME
          Specfies the name of the project to package.

          See the [2067]Package builder.

   NINJA_ALIAS_NAME
          The name of the alias target which will cause SCons to create
          the ninja build file, and then (optionally) run ninja. The
          default value is generate-ninja.

   NINJA_CMD_ARGS
          A string which will pass arguments through SCons to the ninja
          command when scons executes ninja. Has no effect if
          $NINJA_DISABLE_AUTO_RUN is set.

          This value can also be passed on the command line:

scons NINJA_CMD_ARGS=-v
or
scons NINJA_CMD_ARGS="-v -j 3"

   NINJA_COMPDB_EXPAND
          Boolean value to instruct ninja to expand the command line
          arguments normally put into response files. If true, prevents
          unexpanded lines in the compilation database like "gcc
          @rsp_file" and instead yields expanded lines like "gcc -c -o
          myfile.o myfile.c -Ia -DXYZ".

          Ninja's compdb tool added the -x flag in Ninja V1.9.0

   NINJA_DEPFILE_PARSE_FORMAT
          Determines the type of format ninja should expect when parsing
          header include depfiles. Can be msvc, gcc, or clang. The msvc
          option corresponds to /showIncludes format, and gcc or clang
          correspond to -MMD -MF.

   NINJA_DIR
          The builddir value. Propagates directly into the generated ninja
          build file. From Ninja's docs: " A directory for some Ninja
          output files. ... (You can also store other build output in this
          directory.) " The default value is .ninja.

   NINJA_DISABLE_AUTO_RUN
          Boolean. Default: False. If true, SCons will not run ninja
          automatically after creating the ninja build file.

          If not explicitly set, this will be set to True if
          --disable_execute_ninja or SetOption('disable_execute_ninja',
          True) is seen.

   NINJA_ENV_VAR_CACHE
          A string that sets the environment for any environment variables
          that differ between the OS environment and the SCons execution
          environment.

          It will be compatible with the default shell of the operating
          system.

          If not explicitly set, SCons will generate this dynamically from
          the execution environment stored in the current construction
          environment (e.g. env['ENV']) where those values differ from the
          existing shell..

   NINJA_FILE_NAME
          The filename for the generated Ninja build file. The default is
          ninja.build.

   NINJA_FORCE_SCONS_BUILD
          If true, causes the build nodes to call back to scons instead of
          using ninja to build them. This is intended to be passed to the
          environment on the builder invocation. It is useful if you have
          a build node which does something which is not easily translated
          into ninja.

   NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_ALIAS_NAME
          A string matching the name of a user defined alias which
          represents a list of all generated sources. This will prevent
          the auto-detection of generated sources from
          $NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_SUFFIXES. Then all other source files
          will be made to depend on this in the ninja build file, forcing
          the generated sources to be built first.

   NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_SUFFIXES
          The list of source file suffixes which are generated by SCons
          build steps. All source files which match these suffixes will be
          added to the _generated_sources alias in the output ninja build
          file. Then all other source files will be made to depend on this
          in the ninja build file, forcing the generated sources to be
          built first.

   NINJA_MSVC_DEPS_PREFIX
          The msvc_deps_prefix string. Propagates directly into the
          generated ninja build file. From Ninja's docs: "defines the
          string which should be stripped from msvc's /showIncludes
          output"

   NINJA_POOL
          Set the ninja_pool for this or all targets in scope for this env
          var.

   NINJA_REGENERATE_DEPS
          A generator function used to create a ninja depfile which
          includes all the files which would require SCons to be invoked
          if they change. Or a list of said files.

   _NINJA_REGENERATE_DEPS_FUNC
          Internal value used to specify the function to call with
          argument env to generate the list of files which, if changed,
          would require the ninja build file to be regenerated.

   NINJA_SCONS_DAEMON_KEEP_ALIVE
          The number of seconds for the SCons daemon launched by ninja to
          stay alive. (Default: 180000)

   NINJA_SCONS_DAEMON_PORT
          The TCP/IP port for the SCons daemon to listen on. NOTE: You
          cannot use a port already being listened to on your build
          machine. (Default: random number between 10000,60000)

   NINJA_SYNTAX
          The path to a custom ninja_syntax.py file which is used in
          generation. The tool currently assumes you have ninja installed
          as a Python module and grabs the syntax file from that
          installation if $NINJA_SYNTAX is not explicitly set.

   no_import_lib
          When set to non-zero, suppresses creation of a corresponding
          Windows static import lib by the [2068]SharedLibrary builder
          when used with MinGW, Microsoft Visual Studio or Metrowerks.
          This also suppresses creation of an export (.exp) file when
          using Microsoft Visual Studio.

   OBJPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) object file names.

   OBJSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) object file names.

   PACKAGEROOT
          Specifies the directory where all files in resulting archive
          will be placed if applicable. The default value is
          "$NAME-$VERSION".

          See the [2069]Package builder.

   PACKAGETYPE
          Selects the package type to build when using the [2070]Package
          builder. It may be a string or list of strings. See the
          documentation for the builder for the currently supported types.

          $PACKAGETYPE may be overridden with the --package-type command
          line option.

          See the [2071]Package builder.

   PACKAGEVERSION
          The version of the package (not the underlying project). This is
          currently only used by the rpm packager and should reflect
          changes in the packaging, not the underlying project code
          itself.

          See the [2072]Package builder.

   PCH
          A node for the Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header that will
          be used when compiling object files. This variable is ignored by
          tools other than Microsoft Visual C++. When this variable is
          defined, SCons will add options to the compiler command line to
          cause it to use the precompiled header, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PCH file. Examples:

env['PCH'] = File('StdAfx.pch')
env['PCH'] = env.PCH('pch.cc')[0]

   PCHCOM
          The command line used by the [2073]PCH builder to generated a
          precompiled header.

   PCHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a precompiled header. If
          not set, then [2074]$PCHCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   PCHPDBFLAGS
          A construction variable that, when expanded, adds the /yD flag
          to the command line only if the [2075]$PDB construction variable
          is set.

   PCHSTOP
          This variable specifies how much of a source file is
          precompiled. This variable is ignored by tools other than
          Microsoft Visual C++, or when the PCH variable is not being
          used. When this variable is defined, it must be a string that is
          the name of the header that is included at the end of the
          precompiled portion of the source files, or the empty string if
          the "#pragma hrdstop" construct is being used:

env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'

   PDB
          The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging
          information for object files, shared libraries, and programs.
          This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual
          C++. When this variable is defined SCons will add options to the
          compiler and linker command line to cause them to generate
          external debugging information, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PDB file. Example:

env['PDB'] = 'hello.pdb'

          The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by
          default to generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly
          with parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug
          information in the intermediate object files, as opposed to
          sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files. This is
          also the only way to get debug information embedded into a
          static library. Using the /Zi instead may yield improved
          link-time performance, although parallel builds will no longer
          work. You can generate PDB files with the /Zi switch by
          overriding the default [2076]$CCPDBFLAGS variable; see the entry
          for that variable for specific examples.

   PDFLATEX

   PKGCHK
          On Solaris systems, the package-checking program that will be
          used (along with $PKGINFO) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is /usr/sbin/pgkchk.

   PKGINFO
          On Solaris systems, the package information program that will be
          used (along with $PKGCHK) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is pkginfo.

   PLATFORM
          The name of the platform used to create this construction
          environment. SCons sets this when initializing the platform,
          which by default is auto-detected (see the platform argument to
          [2079]Environment).

env = Environment(tools=[])
if env['PLATFORM'] == 'cygwin':
    Tool('mingw')(env)
else:
    Tool('msvc')(env)

   POAUTOINIT
          The $POAUTOINIT variable, if set to True (on non-zero numeric
          value), let the [2080]msginit tool to automatically initialize
          missing PO files with msginit(1). This applies to both,
          [2081]POInit and [2082]POUpdate builders (and others that use
          any of them).

   POCREATE_ALIAS
          Common alias for all PO files created with POInit builder
          (default: 'po-create'). See [2083]msginit tool and [2084]POInit
          builder.

   POSUFFIX
          Suffix used for PO files (default: '.po') See [2085]msginit tool
          and [2086]POInit builder.

   POTDOMAIN
          The $POTDOMAIN defines default domain, used to generate POT
          filename as $POTDOMAIN.pot when no POT file name is provided by
          the user. This applies to [2087]POTUpdate, [2088]POInit and
          [2089]POUpdate builders (and builders, that use them, e.g.
          Translate). Normally (if $POTDOMAIN is not defined), the
          builders use messages.pot as default POT file name.

   POTSUFFIX
          Suffix used for PO Template files (default: '.pot'). See
          [2090]xgettext tool and [2091]POTUpdate builder.

   POTUPDATE_ALIAS
          Name of the common phony target for all PO Templates created
          with [2092]POUpdate (default: 'pot-update'). See [2093]xgettext
          tool and [2094]POTUpdate builder.

   POUPDATE_ALIAS
          Common alias for all PO files being defined with [2095]POUpdate
          builder (default: 'po-update'). See [2096]msgmerge tool and
          [2097]POUpdate builder.

   PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC
          A Python function used to print the command lines as they are
          executed (assuming command printing is not disabled by the -q or
          -s options or their equivalents). The function must accept four
          arguments: s, target, source and env. s is a string showing the
          command being executed, target, is the target being built (file
          node, list, or string name(s)), source, is the source(s) used
          (file node, list, or string name(s)), and env is the environment
          being used.

          The function must do the printing itself. The default
          implementation, used if this variable is not set or is None, is
          to just print the string, as in:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
    sys.stdout.write(s + "\n")

          Here is an example of a more interesting function:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
    sys.stdout.write(
        "Building %s -> %s...\n"
        % (
            ' and '.join([str(x) for x in source]),
            ' and '.join([str(x) for x in target]),
        )
    )

env = Environment(PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC=print_cmd_line)
env.Program('foo', ['foo.c', 'bar.c'])

          This prints:

...
scons: Building targets ...
Building bar.c -> bar.o...
Building foo.c -> foo.o...
Building foo.o and bar.o -> foo...
scons: done building targets.

          Another example could be a function that logs the actual
          commands to a file.

   PROGEMITTER

   RPATH
          A list of paths to search for shared libraries when running
          programs. Currently only used in the GNU (gnulink), IRIX
          (sgilink) and Sun (sunlink) linkers. Ignored on platforms and
          toolchains that don't support it. Note that the paths added to
          RPATH are not transformed by scons in any way: if you want an
          absolute path, you must make it absolute yourself.

   _RPATH
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          rpath flags to be used when linking a program with shared
          libraries. The value of $_RPATH is created by respectively
          prepending $RPATHPREFIX and appending $RPATHSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each directory in $RPATH.

   RPATHPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared
          libraries when running programs. This will be prepended to the
          beginning of each directory in the $RPATH construction variable
          when the $_RPATH variable is automatically generated.

   RPATHSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared
          libraries when running programs. This will be appended to the
          end of each directory in the $RPATH construction variable when
          the $_RPATH variable is automatically generated.

   RPCGEN
          The RPC protocol compiler.

   RPCGENCLIENTFLAGS
          Options passed to the RPC protocol compiler when generating

   SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS
          A hook allowing the execution environment to be modified prior
          to the actual execution of a command line from an action via the
          spawner function defined by [2161]$SPAWN. Allows substitution
          based on targets and sources, as well as values from the
          construction environment, adding extra environment variables,
          etc.

          The value must be a list (or other iterable) of functions which
          each generate or alter the execution environment dictionary. The
          first function will be passed a copy of the initial execution
          environment ([2162]$ENV in the current construction
          environment); the dictionary returned by that function is passed
          to the next, until the iterable is exhausted and the result
          returned for use by the command spawner. The original execution
          environment is not modified.

          Each function provided in $SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS must accept four
          arguments and return a dictionary: env is the construction
          environment for this action; target is the list of targets
          associated with this action; source is the list of sources
          associated with this action; and shell_env is the current
          dictionary after iterating any previous $SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS
          functions (this can be compared to the original execution
          environment, which is available as env['ENV'], to detect any
          changes).

          Example:

def custom_shell_env(env, target, source, shell_env):
    """customize shell_env if desired"""
    if str(target[0]) == 'special_target':
        shell_env['SPECIAL_VAR'] = env.subst('SOME_VAR', target=target, source=s
ource)
    return shell_env

env["SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS"] = [custom_shell_env]

          (e.g. [2248]gnulink).

   SHLIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for shared library file names.

   SHLIBVERSION
          When this construction variable is defined, a versioned shared
          library is created by the [2249]SharedLibrary builder. This
          activates the [2250]$_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and thus modifies the
          [2251]$SHLINKCOM as required, adds the version number to the
          library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed.
          [2252]$SHLIBVERSION versions should exist as alphanumeric,
          decimal-delimited values as defined by the regular expression
          "\w+[\.\w+]*". Example [2253]$SHLIBVERSION values include '1',
          '1.2.3', and '1.2.gitaa412c8b'.

   _SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          This macro automatically introduces extra flags to
          [2254]$SHLINKCOM when building versioned [2255]SharedLibrary
          (that is when [2256]$SHLIBVERSION is set). _SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          usually adds [2257]$SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and some extra dynamically
          generated options (such as -Wl,-soname=$_SHLIBSONAME. It is
          unused by "plain" (unversioned) shared libraries.

   SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          Extra flags added to [2258]$SHLINKCOM when building versioned
          [2259]SharedLibrary. These flags are only used when
          [2260]$SHLIBVERSION is set.

   SHLINK
          The linker for programs that use shared libraries. See also
          [2261]$LINK for linking static objects.

          On POSIX systems (those using the [2262]link tool), you should
          normally not change this value as it defaults to a "smart"
          linker tool which selects a compiler driver matching the type of
          source files in use. So for example, if you set [2263]$SHCXX to
          a specific compiler name, and are compiling C++ sources, the
          smartlink function will automatically select the same compiler
          for linking.

   SHLINKCOM
          The command line used to link programs using shared libraries.
          See also [2264]$LINKCOM for linking static objects.

   SHLINKCOMSTR
          The string displayed when programs using shared libraries are
          linked. If this is not set, then [2265]$SHLINKCOM (the command
          line) is displayed. See also [2266]$LINKCOMSTR for linking
          static objects.

env = Environment(SHLINKCOMSTR = "Linking shared $TARGET")

   SHLINKFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker for programs using
          shared libraries. Note that this variable should not contain -l
          (or similar) options for linking with the libraries listed in
          [2267]$LIBS, nor -L (or similar) include search path options
          that scons generates automatically from [2268]$LIBPATH. See
          [2269]$_LIBFLAGS above, for the variable that expands to
          library-link options, and [2270]$_LIBDIRFLAGS above, for the
          variable that expands to library search path options. See also
          [2271]$LINKFLAGS for linking static objects.

   SHOBJPREFIX
          The prefix used for shared object file names.

   SHOBJSUFFIX
          The suffix used for shared object file names.

   SONAME
          Variable used to hard-code SONAME for versioned shared
          library/loadable module.

env.SharedLibrary('test', 'test.c', SHLIBVERSION='0.1.2', SONAME='libtest.so.2')

          The variable is used, for example, by [2272]gnulink linker tool.

   SOURCE
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   SOURCE_URL
          The URL (web address) of the location from which the project was
          retrieved. This is used to fill in the Source: field in the
          controlling information for Ipkg and RPM packages.

          See the [2273]Package builder.

   SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   SOVERSION
          This will construct the SONAME using on the base library name
          (test in the example below) and use specified SOVERSION to
          create SONAME.

env.SharedLibrary('test', 'test.c', SHLIBVERSION='0.1.2', SOVERSION='2')

          The variable is used, for example, by [2274]gnulink linker tool.

          In the example above SONAME would be libtest.so.2 which would be
          a symlink and point to libtest.so.0.1.2

   SPAWN
          A command interpreter function that will be called to execute
          command line strings. The function must accept five arguments:

def spawn(shell, escape, cmd, args, env):

          shell is a string naming the shell program to use, escape is a
          function that can be called to escape shell special characters
          in the command line, cmd is the path to the command to be
          executed, args holds the arguments to the command and env is a
          dictionary of environment variables defining the execution
          environment in which the command should be executed.

   STATIC_AND_SHARED_OBJECTS_ARE_THE_SAME
          When this variable is true, static objects and shared objects
          are assumed to be the same; that is, SCons does not check for
          linking static objects into a shared library.

   SUBST_DICT
          The dictionary used by the [2275]Substfile or [2276]Textfile
          builders for substitution values. It can be anything acceptable
          to the dict() constructor, so in addition to a dictionary, lists
          of tuples are also acceptable.

   SUBSTFILEPREFIX
          The prefix used for [2277]Substfile file names, an empty string
          by default.

   SUBSTFILESUFFIX
          The suffix used for [2278]Substfile file names, an empty string
          by default.

   SUMMARY
          A short summary of what the project is about. This is used to
          fill in the Summary: field in the controlling information for
          Ipkg and RPM packages, and as the Description: field in MSI
          packages.

          See the [2279]Package builder.

   SWIG
          The name of the SWIG compiler to use.

   SWIGCFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C source files
          generated by SWIG. The default value is '_wrap$CFILESUFFIX' -
          that is, the concatenation of the string _wrap and the current C
          suffix [2280]$CFILESUFFIX. By default, this value is used
          whenever the -c++ option is not specified as part of the
          [2281]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGCOM
          The command line used to call SWIG.

   SWIGCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling SWIG. If this is not set, then
          [2282]$SWIGCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   SWIGCXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ source files
          generated by SWIG. The default value is '_wrap$CXXFILESUFFIX' -
          that is, the concatenation of the string _wrap and the current
          C++ suffix [2283]$CXXFILESUFFIX. By default, this value is used
          whenever the -c++ option is specified as part of the
          [2284]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGDIRECTORSUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ header files
          generated by SWIG. These are only generated for C++ code when
          the SWIG 'directors' feature is turned on. The default value is
          _wrap.h.

   SWIGFLAGS
          General options passed to SWIG. This is where you should set the
          target language (-python, -perl5, -tcl, etc.) and whatever other
          options you want to specify to SWIG, such as the -c++ to
          generate C++ code instead of C Code.

   _SWIGINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          SWIG command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for included files. The value of $_SWIGINCFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending $SWIGINCPREFIX
          and $SWIGINCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $SWIGPATH.

   SWIGINCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be prepended to the beginning of each
          directory in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the
          $_SWIGINCFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGINCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each directory
          in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the $_SWIGINCFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGOUTDIR
          Specifies the output directory in which SWIG should place
          generated language-specific files. This will be used by SCons to
          identify the files that will be generated by the SWIG call, and
          translated into the swig -outdir option on the command line.

   SWIGPATH
          The list of directories that SWIG will search for included
          files. SCons' SWIG implicit dependency scanner will search these
          directories for include files. The default value is an empty
          list.

          Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in
          [2285]$SWIGFLAGS the result will be non-portable and the
          directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner.
          Note: directory names in [2286]$SWIGPATH will be looked-up
          relative to the SConscript directory when they are used in a
          command. To force scons to lookup a directory relative to the
          root of the source tree, use a top-relative path (#):

env = Environment(SWIGPATH='#/include')

          The directory lookup can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(SWIGPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_SWIGINCFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending
          the values of the $SWIGINCPREFIX and $SWIGINCSUFFIX construction
          variables to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $SWIGPATH. Any command lines you define that need the SWIGPATH
          directory list should include $_SWIGINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(SWIGCOM="my_swig -o $TARGET $_SWIGINCFLAGS $SOURCES")

   SWIGVERSION
          The detected version string of the SWIG tool.

   TAR
          The tar archiver.

   TARCOM
          The command line used to call the tar archiver.

   TARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when archiving files using the tar
          archiver. If this is not set, then [2287]$TARCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   TARFLAGS
          General options passed to the tar archiver.

   TARGET
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   TARGET_ARCH
          The name of the hardware architecture that objects created using
          this construction environment should target. Can be set when
          creating a construction environment by passing as a keyword
          argument in the [2288]Environment call.

          On the win32 platform, if the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is
          available, [2289]msvc tool setup is done using [2290]$HOST_ARCH
          and $TARGET_ARCH. If a value is not specified, will be set to
          the same value as [2291]$HOST_ARCH. Changing the value after the
          environment is initialized will not cause the tool to be
          reinitialized. Compiled objects will be in the target
          architecture if the compilation system supports generating for
          that target. The latest compiler which can fulfill the
          requirement will be selected, unless a different version is
          directed by the value of the [2292]$MSVC_VERSION construction
          variable.

          On the win32/msvc combination, valid target arch values are x86,
          arm, i386 for 32-bit targets and amd64, arm64, x86_64 and ia64
          (Itanium) for 64-bit targets. For example, if you want to
          compile 64-bit binaries, you would set TARGET_ARCH='x86_64' when
          creating the construction environment. Note that not all target
          architectures are supported for all Visual Studio / MSVC
          versions. Check the relevant Microsoft documentation.

          $TARGET_ARCH is not currently used by other compilation tools,
          but the option is reserved to do so in future

   TARGET_OS
          The name of the operating system that objects created using this
          construction environment should target. Can be set when creating
          a construction environment by passing as a keyword argument in
          the [2293]Environment call;.

          $TARGET_OS is not currently used by SCons but the option is
          reserved to do so in future

   TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   TARSUFFIX
          The suffix used for tar file names.

   TEMPFILE
          Holds a callable object which will be invoked to transform long
          command lines (string or list) into an alternate form. Length
          limits on various operating systems may cause long command lines
          to fail when calling out to a shell to run the command. Most
          often affects linking, when there are many object files and/or
          libraries to be linked, but may also affect other compilation
          steps which have many arguments. $TEMPFILE is not called
          directly, but rather is typically embedded in another
          construction variable, to be expanded when used. Example:

env["TEMPFILE"] = TempFileMunge
env["LINKCOM"] = "${TEMPFILE('$LINK $TARGET $SOURCES', '$LINKCOMSTR')}"

          The SCons default value for $TEMPFILE, TempFileMunge, performs
          command substitution on the passed command line, calculates
          whether modification is needed, then puts all but the first word
          (assumed to be the command name) of the resulting list into a
          temporary file (sometimes called a response file or command
          file), and returns a new command line consisting of the the
          command name and an appropriately formatted reference to the
          temporary file.

          A replacement for the default tempfile object would need to do
          fundamentally the same thing, including taking into account the
          values of [2294]$MAXLINELENGTH, [2295]$TEMPFILEPREFIX,
          [2296]$TEMPFILESUFFIX, [2297]$TEMPFILEARGJOIN,
          [2298]$TEMPFILEDIR and [2299]$TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC. If a
          particular use case requires a different transformation than the
          default, it is recommended to copy the mechanism and define a
          new construction variable and rewrite the relevant *COM
          variable(s) to use it, to avoid possibly disrupting existing
          uses of $TEMPFILE.

   TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC
          The default argument escape function is
          SCons.Subst.quote_spaces. If you need to apply extra operations
          on a command argument (to fix Windows slashes, normalize paths,
          etc.) before writing to the temporary file, you can set the
          $TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC variable to a custom function. The function
          must accept a single string argument and and return a new string
          with any modifications applied. Example:

import sys
import re
from SCons.Subst import quote_spaces

WINPATHSEP_RE = re.compile(r"\\([^\"'\\]|$)")

def tempfile_arg_esc_func(arg):
    arg = quote_spaces(arg)
    if sys.platform != "win32":
        return arg
    # GCC requires double Windows slashes, let's use UNIX separator
    return WINPATHSEP_RE.sub(r"/\1", arg)

env["TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC"] = tempfile_arg_esc_func

   TEMPFILEARGJOIN
          The string to use to join the arguments passed to
          [2300]$TEMPFILE when the command line exceeds the limit set by
          [2301]$MAXLINELENGTH. The default value is a space. However for
          MSVC, MSLINK the default is a line separator as defined by
          os.linesep. Note this value is used literally and not expanded
          by the subst logic.

   TEMPFILEDIR
          The directory to create the long-lines temporary file in. If
          unset, the Python tempfile module chooses the directory based on
          the TMPDIR, TEMP or TMP environment variables. If the default
          path causes processing errors, set $TEMPFILEDIR to a safer
          alternative. For example, on Windows, the default temporary file
          path contains the username. If the username contains
          non-7-bit-ASCII characters, there may decoding errors opening
          the path to the temporary file. See also
          [2302]$TEMPFILEENCODING.

   TEMPFILEENCODING
          By default, the long-lines temporary file (aka "response file")
          created by the [2303]$TEMPFILE function will be encoded in the
          Python default encoding, UTF-8. If the external command which
          reads the response file encounters decoding errors (usually, if
          that command depends on Windows legacy code pages, and a
          pathname in the response file or the response file path itself
          cannot be represented in the 7-bit ASCII characer set), set this
          variable to the appropriate codec. See also [2304]$TEMPFILEDIR.

          New in version 4.10.0

   TEMPFILEPREFIX
          The prefix for the name of the temporary file used to store
          command lines exceeding [2305]$MAXLINELENGTH. The prefix must
          include the compiler syntax to actually include and process the
          file. The default prefix is '@', which works for the Microsoft
          Visual C++ and GNU toolchains on Windows. Set this appropriately
          for other toolchains, for example '-@' for the diab compiler or
          '-via' for ARM toolchain.

   TEMPFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for the name of the temporary file used to store
          command lines exceeding [2306]$MAXLINELENGTH. The suffix should
          include the dot ('.') if one is needed as it will not be added
          automatically. The default is .lnk.

   TEX
          The TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXCOM
          The command line used to call the TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the TeX formatter and
          typesetter. If this is not set, then [2307]$TEXCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

   TEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXINPUTS
          List of directories that the LaTeX program will search for
          include directories. The LaTeX implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for \include and \import files.

   TEXTFILEPREFIX
          The prefix used for [2308]Textfile file names, an empty string
          by default.

   TEXTFILESUFFIX
          The suffix used for [2309]Textfile file names; .txt by default.

   TOOLS
          A list of the names of the Tool specification modules that were
          actually initialized in the current construction environment.
          This may be useful as a diagnostic aid to see if a tool did (or
          did not) run. The value is informative and is not guaranteed to
          be complete.

   UNCHANGED_SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   UNCHANGED_TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   VENDOR
          The person or organization who supply the packaged software.
          This is used to fill in the Vendor: field in the controlling
          information for RPM packages, and the Manufacturer: field in the
          controlling information for MSI packages.

          See the [2310]Package builder.

   VERSION
          The version of the project, specified as a string.

          See the [2311]Package builder.

   VSWHERE
          Specify the location of vswhere.exe.

          The vswhere.exe executable is distributed with Microsoft Visual
          Studio and Build Tools since the 2017 edition, but is also
          available as a standalone installation. It allows queries to
          obtain detailed information about installations of 2017 and
          later editions. SCons makes use of this information to determine
          the state of compiler support for those editions.

          Setting the $VSWHERE variable to the path to a specific
          vswhere.exe binary causes SCons to use that binary. If not set,
          SCons will search for one, looking in the following locations in
          order, using the first found ($VSWHERE is updated with the
          location):

          %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer
          %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer
          %ChocolateyInstall%\bin
          %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Links
          %USERPROFILE%\scoop\shims
          %SCOOP%\shims

Note

          In order to take effect, $VSWHERE must be set before the initial
          Microsoft Visual C++ compiler discovery takes place. Discovery
          happens, at the latest, during the first call to the
          [2312]Environment function, unless a tools list is specified
          which excludes the entire Microsoft Visual C++ toolchain - that
          is, omits "defaults" and any specific tool module that refers to
          parts of the toolchain ([2313]msvc, [2314]mslink, [2315]masm,
          [2316]midl and [2317]msvs). In this case, detection is deferred
          until any one of those tool modules is invoked manually. The
          following two examples illustrate this:

# VSWHERE set as Environment is created
env = Environment(VSWHERE='c:/my/path/to/vswhere')

# Initialization deferred with empty tools, triggered manually
env = Environment(tools=[])
env['VSWHERE'] = r'c:/my/vswhere/install/location/vswhere.exe'
env.Tool('msvc')
env.Tool('mslink')
env.Tool('msvs')

   WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST
          Set to True to embed the compiler-generated manifest (normally
          ${TARGET}.manifest) into all Windows executables and DLLs built
          with this environment, as a resource during their link step.
          This is done using [2318]$MT and [2319]$MTEXECOM and
          [2320]$MTSHLIBCOM. See also [2321]$WINDOWS_INSERT_MANIFEST.

   WINDOWS_INSERT_DEF
          If set to true, a library build of a Windows shared library
          (.dll file) will include a reference to the corresponding
          module-definition file at the same time, if a module-definition
          file is not already listed as a build target. The name of the
          module-definition file will be constructed from the base name of
          the library and the construction variables
          [2322]$WINDOWSDEFSUFFIX and [2323]$WINDOWSDEFPREFIX. The default
          is to not add a module-definition file. The module-definition
          file is not created by this directive, and must be supplied by
          the developer.

   WINDOWS_INSERT_MANIFEST
          If set to true, scons will add the manifest file generated by
          Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 and later to the target list so SCons
          will be aware they were generated. In the case of an executable,
          the manifest file name is constructed using
          [2324]$WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTSUFFIX and
          [2325]$WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTPREFIX. In the case of a shared
          library, the manifest file name is constructed using
          [2326]$WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTSUFFIX and
          [2327]$WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTPREFIX. See also
          [2328]$WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST.

          Microsoft Visual C++. Defaults to empty.

   WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTSUFFIX
          The suffix used for shared library manifest files generated by
          Microsoft Visual C++. Defaults to .manifest.

          A list used to supply extra definitions or flags to be added to
          the RPM .spec file. Each item is added as-is with a carriage
          return appended. This is useful if some specific RPM feature not
          otherwise anticipated by SCons needs to be turned on or off.
          Note if this variable is omitted, SCons will by default supply
          the value '%global debug_package %{nil}' to disable debug
          package generation. To enable debug package generation, include
          this variable set either to None, or to a custom list that does
          not include the default line.

          New in version 3.1.

   XGETTEXT
          Path to xgettext(1) program (found via Detect()). See
          [2333]xgettext tool and [2334]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTCOM
          Complete xgettext command line. See [2335]xgettext tool and
          [2336]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTCOMSTR
          A string that is shown when xgettext(1) command is invoked
          (default: '', which means "print [2337]$XGETTEXTCOM"). See
          [2338]xgettext tool and [2339]POTUpdate builder.

   _XGETTEXTDOMAIN
          Internal "macro". Generates xgettext domain name form source and
          target (default: '${TARGET.filebase}').

   XGETTEXTFLAGS
          Additional flags to xgettext(1). See [2340]xgettext tool and
          [2341]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTFROM
          Name of file containing list of xgettext(1)'s source files.
          Autotools' users know this as POTFILES.in so they will in most
          cases set XGETTEXTFROM="POTFILES.in" here. The $XGETTEXTFROM
          files have same syntax and semantics as the well known GNU
          POTFILES.in. See [2342]xgettext tool and [2343]POTUpdate
          builder.

   _XGETTEXTFROMFLAGS
          Internal "macro". Generates list of -D<dir> flags from the
          [2344]$XGETTEXTPATH list.

   XGETTEXTFROMPREFIX
          This flag is used to add single [2345]$XGETTEXTFROM file to
          xgettext(1)'s command line (default: '-f').

   XGETTEXTFROMSUFFIX
          (default: '')

   XGETTEXTPATH
          List of directories, there xgettext(1) will look for source
          files (default: []).

Note

          This variable works only together with [2346]$XGETTEXTFROM

          See also [2347]xgettext tool and [2348]POTUpdate builder.

   _XGETTEXTPATHFLAGS
          Internal "macro". Generates list of -f<file> flags from
          [2349]$XGETTEXTFROM.

   XGETTEXTPATHPREFIX
          This flag is used to add single search path to xgettext(1)'s
          command line (default: '-D').

   XGETTEXTPATHSUFFIX
          (default: '')

   YACC
          The parser generator.

   YACC_GRAPH_FILE
          If supplied, write a graph of the automaton to a file with the
          name taken from this variable. Will be emitted as a --graph=
          command-line option. Use this in preference to including
          --graph= in [2350]$YACCFLAGS directly.

          New in version 4.4.0.

   YACC_GRAPH_FILE_SUFFIX
          Previously specified by [2351]$YACCVCGFILESUFFIX.

          The suffix of the file containing a graph of the grammar
          automaton when the -g option (or --graph= without an
          option-argument) is used in [2352]$YACCFLAGS. Note that setting
          this variable informs SCons how to construct the graph filename
          for tracking purposes, it does not affect the actual generated
          filename. Various yacc tools have emitted various formats at
          different times. Set this to match what your parser generator
          produces.

          New in version 4.6.0.

   YACC_HEADER_FILE
          If supplied, generate a header file with the name taken from
          this variable. Will be emitted as a --header= command-line
          option. Use this in preference to including --header= in
          [2353]$YACCFLAGS directly.

          New in version 4.4.0.

   YACCCOM
          The command line used to call the parser generator to generate a
          source file.

   YACCCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          parser generator. If this is not set, then [2354]$YACCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(YACCCOMSTR="Yacc'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   YACCFLAGS
          General options passed to the parser generator. In addition to
          passing the value on during invocation, the [2355]yacc tool also
          examines this construction variable for options which cause
          additional output files to be generated, and adds those to the
          target list.

          If the -d option is present in $YACCFLAGS scons assumes that the
          call will also create a header file with the suffix defined by
          [2356]$YACCHFILESUFFIX if the yacc source file ends in a .y
          suffix, or a file with the suffix defined by
          [2357]$YACCHXXFILESUFFIX if the yacc source file ends in a .yy
          suffix. The header will have the same base name as the requested
          target. This is only correct if the executable is bison (or
          win_bison). If using Berkeley yacc (byacc), y.tab.h is always
          written - avoid the -d in this case and use
          [2358]$YACC_HEADER_FILE instead.

          If a -g option is present, scons assumes that the call will also
          create a graph file with the suffix defined by
          [2359]$YACCVCGFILESUFFIX.

          If a -v option is present, scons assumes that the call will also
          create an output debug file with the suffix .output.

          Also recognized are GNU bison options --header (and its
          deprecated synonym --defines), which is similar to -d but gives
          the option to explicitly name the output header file through an
          option argument; and --graph, which is similar to -g but gives
          the option to explicitly name the output graph file through an
          option argument. The file suffixes described for -d and -g above
          are not applied if these are used in the option=argument form.

          Note that files specified by --header= and --graph= may not be
          properly handled by SCons in all situations, and using those in
          $YACCFLAGS should be considered legacy support only. Consider
          using [2360]$YACC_HEADER_FILE and [2361]$YACC_GRAPH_FILE instead
          if the files need to be explicitly named (new in version 4.4.0).

   YACCHFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option (or --header without an
          option-argument) is used in [2362]$YACCFLAGS. Note that setting
          this variable informs SCons how to construct the header filename
          for tracking purposes, it does not affect the actual generated
          filename. Set this to match what your parser generator produces.
          The default value is .h.

   YACCHXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C++ header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option (or --header without an
          option-argument) is used in [2363]$YACCFLAGS. Note that setting
          this variable informs SCons how to construct the header filename
          for tracking purposes, it does not affect the actual generated
          filename. Set this to match what your parser generator produces.
          The default value is .hpp.

   YACCVCGFILESUFFIX
          Obsoleted. Use [2364]$YACC_GRAPH_FILE_SUFFIX instead. The value
          is used only if $YACC_GRAPH_FILE_SUFFIX is not set. The default
          value is .gv.

          Changed in version 4.6.0: deprecated. The default value changed
          from .vcg (bison stopped generating .vcg output with version
          2.4, in 2006).

   ZIP
          The zip compression and file packaging utility.

   ZIP_OVERRIDE_TIMESTAMP
          An optional timestamp which overrides the last modification time
          of the file when stored inside the Zip archive. This is a tuple
          of six values: Year (>= 1980) Month (one-based) Day of month
          (one-based) Hours (zero-based) Minutes (zero-based) Seconds
          (zero-based)

   ZIPCOM
          The command line used to call the zip utility, or the internal
          Python function used to create a zip archive.

   ZIPCOMPRESSION
          The compression flag from the Python zipfile module used by the
          internal Python function to control whether the zip archive is
          compressed or not. The default value is zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED,
          which creates a compressed zip archive. This value has no effect
          if the zipfile module is unavailable.

   ZIPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when archiving files using the zip utility.
          If this is not set, then [2365]$ZIPCOM (the command line or
          internal Python function) is displayed.

env = Environment(ZIPCOMSTR = "Zipping $TARGET")

   ZIPFLAGS
          General options passed to the zip utility.

   ZIPROOT
          An optional zip root directory (default empty). The filenames
          stored in the zip file will be relative to this directory, if
          given. Otherwise, the filenames are relative to the current
          directory of the command. For instance:

env = Environment()
env.Zip('foo.zip', 'subdir1/subdir2/file1', ZIPROOT='subdir1')

          will produce a zip file foo.zip containing a file with the name
          subdir2/file1 rather than subdir1/subdir2/file1.

   ZIPSUFFIX
          The suffix used for zip file names.

Configure Contexts

   SCons provides an integrated autoconfiguration mechanism (inspired by
   GNU Autoconf but intrinsic to SCons), for checking the existence of
   external items needed for the build, such as C header files, libraries,
   etc. This can be used to build optional features only if support for
   them is available, abort the build quickly if required elements are
   missing, or just tune the build to the specific build platform. The
   mechanism is portable across platforms.

   You activate the configuration sysem by creating a configure context,
   which holds accumulated information while the checks are being
   performed, request the desired checks, and then transfer the
   information to the regular build environment. Optionally, a configure
   header that C or C++ code can include can also be generated. SCons does
   not maintain an explicit cache of the tested values (unlike Autoconf),
   but uses its normal dependency tracking to keep the checked values up
   to date. You may override this behavior with the [2366]--config command
   line option.

   Configure(env, [custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h, clean,
          help])
          env.Configure([custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h,
          clean, help])
          Create a configure context, which tracks information discovered
          while running checks. The context includes a local construction
          environment (available as context.env) which is used when
          running the checks and which can be updated with the check
          results. Only one context may be active at a time, but a new
          context can be created after the active one is completed. For
          the global function form, the required env describes the initial
          values for the context's local construction environment; for the
          construction environment method form the instance provides the
          values.

          custom_tests specifies a dictionary containing custom checks
          (see [2367]details below). The default value is None, to
          indicate there are no custom checks in the configure context.

          conf_dir specifies a directory where the test cases are built.
          This directory is not used for building normal targets. The
          default value is "#/.sconf_temp".

          log_file specifies a file which collects the output from
          commands that are executed to check for the existence of header
          files, libraries, etc. The default is "#/config.log". If you are
          using variant directories, you may want to place the log file
          for a given build under that build's variant directory.

          config_h specifies a C header file where the results of tests
          will be written, so the build can have access to this
          information by including it. The results will consist of lines
          like #define HAVE_GETADDRINFO 1, #define HAVE_INTTYPES_H 1, etc.
          The default is None, which creates no configure header. The
          convention has been to call the configure header config.h. You
          can specify the same config_h file in multiple calls to
          Configure, in which case SCons will concatenate all results in
          the specified file. Note that SCons uses its normal dependency
          tracking to decide if it's necessary to rebuild the configure
          hearer. This means that the file is not necessarily rebuilt each
          time scons is run, but is only rebuilt if its contents will have
          changed and some target that depends on the configure header is
          being built.

          The clean and help arguments can be used to suppress execution
          of the configuration tests when the -c/--clean or -H/-h/--help
          options are used, respectively. The default behavior is always
          to execute configure context tests, since the results of the
          tests may affect the list of targets to be cleaned or the help
          text. If the configure tests do not affect these, then you may
          add the clean=False or help=False arguments (or both) to avoid
          unnecessary test execution.

          Changed in version 4.0: raises an exception on an attempt to
          create a new context when there is an active context.

   context.Finish()
          Must be called after configuration is complete. Though required,
          this is not enforced except if Configure is called again while
          there is still an active context, in which case an exception is
          raised. Returns the context's construction environment as
          modified during the course of running the configuration checks -
          the original environment is unchanged; typically the returned
          environment is used to replace the original. After this method
          is called, no further checks can be performed with this
          configuration context. However, you can create a new configure
          context to perform additional checks.

   Example of a typical Configure usage:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckCHeader("math.h"):
    print("We really need math.h!")
    Exit(1)
if conf.CheckLibWithHeader("qt", "qapp.h", "c++", call="QApplication qapp(0,0);"
):
    # do stuff for qt - usage, e.g.
    conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES="WITH_QT")
env = conf.Finish()

   A configure context has the following predefined methods which can be
   used to perform checks. Where language is an optional parameter, it
   specifies the programming language of the check, currently a choice of
   C or C++. The spellings accepted for C are "C" or "c"; for C++ the
   value can be "CXX", "cxx", "C++" or "c++". If language is omitted, "C"
   is assumed.

   context.CheckHeader(header, [include_quotes, language])
          Check if header can be used when building this project. A
          generated stub program in the specified language is built to
          check. header may also be a list, in which case the last item in
          the list is the header file to be checked, and the previous list
          items are header files whose #include directives should precede
          the header line being checked for. The optional argument
          include_quotes specifies the characters wrapping the header name
          - only the first two are considered. Essentially, this allows
          you to swap the default double-quotes ("") for angle brackets
          (<>).

          Returns a boolean indicating success or failure. If a configure
          header was requested, the result is recorded in it in the form
          of a preprocessor macro in the case of success, or an
          informative comment in the case of failure.

   context.CheckCHeader(header, [include_quotes])
          Check if header is usable when compiling a C language program.
          This is a wrapper around [2368]CheckHeader - see its entry for
          details.

   context.CheckCXXHeader(header, [include_quotes])
          Check if header is usable when compiling a C++ language program.
          This is a wrapper around [2369]CheckHeader - see its entry for
          details.

   context.CheckFunc(function_name, [header, language, funcargs])
          Check if function_name is usable in the context's local
          environment, using the compiler specified by language - that is,
          can a check referencing it be compiled using the current values
          of [2370]$CFLAGS, [2371]$CPPFLAGS, [2372]$LIBS or other relevant
          construction variables.

          The optional header argument is a string representing a code
          fragment to place at the top of the test program that will be
          compiled to check if the function exists. If omitted, the
          default stanza will be (with function_name appropriately
          substituted):

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
#endif
char function_name(void);

          If header is supplied, it should not include the standard header
          file that declares function_name and it should include a dummy
          prototype similar to the default case. If this is not possible,
          the optional funcargs argument can be used to specify a string
          containing an argument list with the same number and type of
          arguments as the prototype. The arguments can simply be constant
          values of the correct type. Modern C/C++ compilers reject
          implicit function declarations and may also reject function
          calls whose arguments are not type compatible with the
          prototype.

          Returns a boolean indicating success or failure. If a configure
          header was requested, the result is recorded in it in the form
          of a preprocessor macro in the case of success, or an
          informative comment in the case of failure.

          Changed in version 4.7.0: added the funcargs.

   context.CheckLib([library, symbol, header, language, extra_libs=None,
          autoadd=True, append=True, unique=False])
          Check if library can be used to build this project (see also
          [2373]CheckLibWithHeader). A small stub program is generated and
          linked against library by the compiler selected by language. If
          symbol is specified, the stub will contain a reference to that
          symbol, to check if it is actually provided by the library. If
          supplied, the text of header is included at the top of the stub;
          it must be syntactically correct in language.

          Note that if symbol is given, the stub will be generated with an
          old-style prototype, as it has no knowledge of the actual
          prototype (e.g. char sin(); instead of double sin(double x);).
          Such usage is no longer legal under C23 and later.

          The remaining arguments should be specified in keyword style. If
          extra_libs is specified, it is a list off additional libraries
          to include when linking the stub program (usually, dependencies
          of the library being checked). If autoadd is true (the default),
          and the link succeeds, the library is added to the [2374]$LIBS
          construction variable in the context. If append is true (the
          default), an added library is appended, otherwise it is
          prepended. If unique is true, and the library would otherwise be
          added but is already present in [2375]$LIBS in the configure
          context, it will not be added again. The default is False.

          library can be a list of library names, or None (the default if
          the argument is omitted). If the former, symbol is checked
          against each library name in order, returning (and reporting
          success) on the first successful test; if the latter, it is
          checked with the current value of $LIBS (in this case no library
          name would be added). If symbol is omitted or None, then
          CheckLib just checks if you can link against the specified
          library. Note though it is legal syntax, it would not be very
          useful to call this method with library and symbol both omitted
          or None - at least one should be supplied.

          Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

          Changed in version 4.5.0: added the append and unique
          parameters.

          Changed in version 4.9.0: added the extra_libs parameter.

   context.CheckLibWithHeader([library, header, language, extra_libs=None,
          call=None, autoadd=True, append=True, unique=False])
          Check if library can be used to build this project, when a
          header file must be included to use library (see also
          [2376]CheckLib). The first three arguments can be given as
          either positional or keyword arguments. library specifies a
          library or list of libraries to check (the default is None),
          header specifies a header file or list of header files to
          include in the test program. If header is a list, the last item
          in the list is the header file to be checked, and the previous
          list items are header files whose #include lines should precede
          the header line being checked for. The default is to include no
          header text.

          The remaining parameters should be specified in keyword style.
          If provided, call is a code fragment to compile as the stub
          test, replacing the auto-generated stub. The fragment must be a
          valid expression in language. If not supplied, the default
          checks the ability to link against the specified library.
          extra_libs can be used to add additional libraries to link
          against (usually, dependencies of the library under test). If
          autoadd is true (the default), the first library that passes the
          check is added to the [2377]$LIBS construction variable in the
          configure context and the method returns. If append is true (the
          default), an added library is appended, otherwise it is
          prepended. If unique is true, and the library would otherwise be
          added but is already present in [2378]$LIBS in the configure
          context, it will not be added again. The default is False.

          Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

          Changed in version 4.5.0: added the append and unique
          parameters.

          Changed in version 4.9.0: added the extra_libs parameter.

   context.CheckType(type_name, [includes, language])
          Check whether type_name is defined via a typedef. includes is a
          string containing one or more #include lines that will be placed
          at the top of the stub program that will be compiled to perform
          the check. Returns a boolean indicating success or failure. If a
          configure header was requested, the result is recorded in it in
          the form of a preprocessor macro in the case of success, or an
          informative comment in the case of failure.

          Example:

sconf.CheckType('foo_type', '#include "my_types.h"', 'C++')

   context.CheckTypeSize(type_name, [header, language, expect])
          Check for the size of a type type_name defined via a typedef (or
          built in). The optional header argument is a string that will be
          placed at the top of the stub program that will be compiled to
          perform the check - the default is empty. The check succeeds and
          returns the size of the type if it is found, else zero. If the
          optional expect (integer) parameter is given, the check succeeds
          only if the detected size matches it.

          Example:

CheckTypeSize('short', expect=2)

          will return the size 2 only if short is actually two bytes.

   context.CheckCC()
          Check whether the C compiler (as defined by the [2379]$CC
          construction variable) works, by trying to compile a small
          source file. This provides a more rigorous check: by default,
          SCons itself only detects if there is a program with the correct
          name, not if it is a functioning compiler. Returns a boolean
          indicating success or failure.

          The test program will be built with the same command line as the
          one used by the [2380]Object builder for C source files, so by
          setting relevant construction variables it can be used to detect
          if particular compiler flags will be accepted or rejected by the
          compiler.

   context.CheckCXX()
          Check whether the C++ compiler (as defined by the [2381]$CXX
          construction variable) works, by trying to compile a small
          source file. This provides a more rigorous check: by default,
          SCons itself only detects if there is a program with the correct
          name, not if it is a functioning compiler. Returns a boolean
          indicating success or failure.

          The test program will be built with the same command line as the
          one used by the [2382]Object builder for C++ source files, so by
          setting relevant construction variables it can be used to detect
          if particular compiler flags will be accepted or rejected by the
          compiler.

   context.CheckSHCC()
          Check whether the shared-object C compiler (as defined by the
          [2383]$SHCC construction variable) works by trying to compile a
          small source file. This provides a more rigorous check: by
          default, SCons itself only detects if there is a program with
          the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler. Returns a
          boolean indicating success or failure.

          The test program will be built with the same command line as the
          one used by the [2384]SharedObject builder for C source files,
          so by setting relevant construction variables it can be used to
          detect if particular compiler flags will be accepted or rejected
          by the compiler. Note this does not check whether a shared
          library/dll can be created.

   context.CheckSHCXX()
          Check whether the shared-object C++ compiler (as defined by the
          [2385]$SHCXX construction variable) works by trying to compile a
          small source file. This provides a more rigorous check: by
          default, SCons itself only detects if there is a program with
          the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler. Returns a
          boolean indicating success or failure.

          The test program will be built with the same command line as the
          one used by the [2386]SharedObject builder for C++ source files,
          so by setting relevant construction variables it can be used to
          detect if particular compiler flags will be accepted or rejected
          by the compiler. Note this does not check whether a shared
          library/dll can be created.

   context.CheckProg(prog_name)
          Check if prog_name exists in the path SCons will use at build
          time. (context.env['ENV']['PATH']). Returns a string containing
          the path to the program, or None on failure.

   context.CheckDeclaration(symbol, [includes, language])
          Check if the specified symbol is declared. includes is a string
          containing one or more #include lines that will be inserted into
          the program that will be run to test for the existence of the
          symbol.

          Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

   context.CheckMember(aggregate_member, [header, language])
          Check for the existence of a member of the C/C++ struct or
          class. aggregate_member specifies the struct/class and member to
          check for. header is a string containing one or more #include
          lines that will be inserted into the program that will be run to
          test for the existence of the member. Example:

sconf.CheckMember('struct tm.tm_sec', '#include <time.h>')

          Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

          Added in 4.4.0.

   context.Define(symbol, [value, comment])
          This method does not check for anything, but rather forces the
          definition of a preprocessor macro that will be added to the
          configure header. name is the macro's identifier. If value is
          given, it will be be used as the macro replacement value. If
          value is a string and needs to display with quotes, the quotes
          need to be included, as in '"string"' If the optional comment is
          given, it is inserted as a comment above the macro definition
          (suitable comment marks will be added automatically). This is
          analogous to using AC_DEFINE in Autoconf.

          Examples:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL
conf.Define("A_SYMBOL")

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL 1
conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", 1)

          Examples of quoting string values:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL YA
conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", "YA")

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL "YA"
conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", '"YA"')

          Example including comment:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)

# Puts the following lines in the config header file:
#    /* Set to 1 if you have a symbol */
#    #define A_SYMBOL 1
conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", 1, "Set to 1 if you have a symbol")

   You can define your own custom checks in addition to using the
   predefined checks. To enable custom checks, pass a dictionary to the
   [2387]Configure function as the custom_tests parameter. The dictionary
   maps the names of the checks to the custom check callables (either a
   Python function or an instance of a class implementing a __call__
   method). Each custom check will be called with a a CheckContext
   instance as the first parameter followed by the remaining arguments,
   which must be supplied by the user of the check. A CheckContext is not
   the same as a configure context; rather it is an instance of a class
   which contains a configure context (available as chk_ctx.sconf). A
   CheckContext provides the following methods which custom checks can
   make use of::

   chk_ctx.Message(text)
          Displays text as an indicator of progress. For example: Checking
          for library X.... Usually called before the check is started.

   chk_ctx.Result(res)
          Displays a result message as an indicator of progress. If res is
          an integer, displays yes if res evaluates true or no if false.
          If res is a string, it is displayed as-is. Usually called after
          the check has completed.

   chk_ctx.TryCompile(text, extension='')
          Check if a file containing text and given the specified
          extension (e.g. '.c') can be compiled to an object file using
          the environment's [2388]Object builder. Returns a boolean
          indicating success or failure.

   chk_ctx.TryLink(text, extension='')
          Check if a file containing text and given the specified
          extension (e.g. '.c') can be compiled to an executable program
          using the environment's [2389]Program builder. Returns a boolean
          indicating success or failure.

   chk_ctx.TryRun(text, extension='')
          Check if a file containing text and given the specified
          extension (e.g. '.c') can be compiled to an excutable program
          using the environment's [2390]Program builder and subsequently
          executed. Execution is only attempted if the build succeeds. If
          the program executes successfully (that is, its return status is
          0), a tuple (True, outputStr) is returned, where outputStr is
          the standard output of the program. If the program fails
          execution (its return status is non-zero), then (False, '') is
          returned.

   chk_ctx.TryAction(action, [text, extension=''])
          Check if the specified action with an optional source file
          (contents text, given extension extension) can be executed.
          action may be anything which can be converted to an [2391]Action
          Object. On success, a tuple (True, outputStr) is returned, where
          outputStr is the content of the target file. On failure (False,
          '') is returned.

   chk_ctx.TryBuild(builder, [text, extension=''])
          Low level implementation for testing specific builds; the
          methods above are based on this method. Given the Builder
          instance builder and the optional text of a source file with
          optional extension, returns a boolean indicating success or
          failure. In addition, chk_ctx.lastTarget is set to the build
          target node if the build was successful.

   Example of implementing and using custom checks:
def CheckQt(chk_ctx, qtdir):
    chk_ctx.Message('Checking for qt ...')
    lastLIBS = chk_ctx.env['LIBS']
    lastLIBPATH = chk_ctx.env['LIBPATH']
    lastCPPPATH = chk_ctx.env['CPPPATH']
    chk_ctx.env.Append(LIBS='qt', LIBPATH=qtdir + '/lib', CPPPATH=qtdir + '/incl
ude')
    ret = chk_ctx.TryLink(
        """\
#include <qapp.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  QApplication qapp(argc, argv);
  return 0;
}
"""
    )
    if not ret:
        chkctx.env.Replace(LIBS=lastLIBS, LIBPATH=lastLIBPATH, CPPPATH=lastCPPPA
TH)
    chkctx.Result(ret)
    return ret

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env, custom_tests={'CheckQt': CheckQt})
if not conf.CheckQt('/usr/lib/qt'):
    print('We really need qt!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

Command-Line Construction Variables

   SCons depends on information stored in construction variables to
   control how targets are built. It is often necessary to pass
   specialized information at build time to override the variables in the
   build scripts. This can be done through variable-assignment arguments
   on the command line and/or in stored variable files.

   For the case where you want to specify new values for construction
   variables, SCons provides a Variables object to simplify collecting
   those and updating a construction environment with the values. This
   helps processing commands lines like this:
scons VARIABLE=foo OTHERVAR=bar

   Variables supplied on the command line can always be manually processed
   by iterating the [2392]ARGUMENTS dictionary or the [2393]ARGLIST list,
   However, using a Variables object allows you to describe anticipated
   variables, perform necessary type conversion, validate that values meet
   defined constraints, and specify default values, help messages and
   aliases. This provides a somewhat similar interface to option handling
   (see [2394]AddOption). A Variables object also allows obtaining values
   from a saved variables file, or from a custom dictionary in an
   SConscript file. The processed variables can then be applied to the
   desired construction environment.

   Conceptually, command-line targets control what to build, command-line
   variables (and variable files) control how to build, and command-line
   options control how SCons operates (although SCons does not enforce
   that separation).

   To obtain an object for manipulating variables, call the Variables
   factory function:

   Variables([files, [args]])
          If files is a filename or list of filenames, they are executed
          as Python scripts to set saved variables when the [2395]Update
          method is called. This allows the use of Python syntax in the
          assignments. A variables file can be the result of an previous
          call to the [2396]Save method. If files is not specified, or the
          files argument is None, then no files will be processed.
          Supplying None is required if there are no files but you want to
          specify args as a positional argument; or you can use keyword
          arguments to avoid that. If any of files is missing, it is
          silently skipped.

          Either of the following example file contents could be used to
          set an alternative C compiler:

CC = 'my_cc'
CC = os.environ.get('CC')

          If args is specified, it must be a dictionary. The key-value
          pairs from args will be added to those obtained from files, if
          any. Keys from args take precedence over same-named keys from
          files. If omitted, the default is the [2397]ARGUMENTS dictionary
          that holds build variables specified on the command line. Using
          ARGUMENTS allows you to indicate that if a setting appears on
          both the command line and in the file(s), the command line
          setting is preferred. However, any dictionary can be passed.
          Examples:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars = Variables('overrides.py', ARGUMENTS)
vars = Variables(None, {FOO:'expansion', BAR:7})
vars = Variables(args={FOO:'expansion', BAR:7})

          Calling Variables with no arguments is equivalent to:

vars = Variables(files=None, args=ARGUMENTS)

   A Variables object is a container for variable descriptions, added by
   calling the [2398]Add or [2399]AddVariables methods. A variable
   description consists of a name, a list of aliases for the name, a help
   message, a default value, and functions to validate and convert values.
   Processing of input sources is deferred until the [2400]Update method
   is called, at which time the variables are added to the specified
   construction environment, using the name as the construction variable
   name; any aliases are not added. Variables from the input sources which
   do not match any names or aliases from the variable descriptions in
   this object are skipped, except that a dictionary of their names and
   values are made available in the [2401]unknown attribute of the
   Variables object. This list can also be obtained via the
   [2402]UnknownVariables method. If a variable description has a default
   value other than None and does not appear in the input sources, it is
   added to the construction environment with its default value. A list of
   variables set from their defaults and not from the input sources is
   available as the [2403]defaulted attribute of the Variables object. The
   unknown variables and defaulted information is not available until the
   Update method has run.

   Since the variables are eventually added as construction variables, you
   should choose variable names which do not unintentionally change
   pre-defined construction variables that your project will make use of
   (see [2404]the section called "Construction Variables" for a
   reference), since the specified values are assigned, not merged, to the
   respective construction variables.

   The Variables subsystem does not directly support a way to define a
   variable the user must supply, but this can be simulated by using a
   validator function, and specifying a default value which the validator
   will reject, resulting in an invalid value error message (the
   convenience methods EnumVariable and ListVariable make this relatively
   straightforward).

   A Variables object has the following methods:

   vars.Add(key, [help, default, validator, converter, subst])
          Add a customizable construction variable to the Variables
          object. key is either the name of the variable, or a sequence of
          strings, in which case the first item in the sequence is taken
          as the variable name, and any remaining values are considered
          aliases for the variable. key is mandatory, the other fields are
          optional. help is the help text for the variable (defaults to an
          empty string). default is the default value of the variable
          (defaults to None). The variable will be set to the value of
          default if it does not appear in the input sources, except if
          default is None, in which case it is not added to the
          construction environment unless it has been set in the input
          sources.

          If the validator argument is supplied, it is a callback function
          to validate the value of the variable when the variables are
          processed (that is, when the [2405]Update method runs). A
          validator function must accept three arguments: key, value and
          env, and should raise an exception (with a helpful error
          message) if value is invalid. No return value is expected from
          the validator.

          If the converter argument is supplied, it is a callback function
          to convert the value into one suitable for adding to the
          construction environment. A converter function must accept the
          value argument, and may declare env as a second argument if it
          needs access to the construction environment while validating -
          the function will be called appropriately. The converter is
          called before the validator; it must return a value, which is
          then passed to the validator (if any) for checking. In general,
          the converter should not fail, leaving validation checks to the
          validator, although if an operation is impossible to complete or
          there is no separate validator it can raise a ValueError.

          Substitution will be performed on the variable value before the
          converter and validator are called, unless the optional subst
          parameter is false (the default is True). Suppressing
          substitution may be useful if the variable value looks like a
          construction variable reference (e.g. $VAR) and the validator
          and/or converter should see it unexpanded.

          As a special case, if key is a sequence and is the only argument
          to Add, it is unpacked into the five parameters key, help,
          default, validator and converter, with any missing members from
          the right filled in with the respective default values. This
          form allows it to consume a tuple emitted by the convenience
          functions [2406]BoolVariable, [2407]EnumVariable,
          [2408]ListVariable, [2409]PackageVariable and
          [2410]PathVariable.

          Examples:

vars.Add('CC', help='The C compiler')

def valid_color(key, val, env):
    if not val in ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']:
        raise Exception("Invalid color value '%s'" % val)

vars.Add('COLOR', validator=valid_color)

          Changed in version 4.8.0: added the subst parameter.

   vars.AddVariables(args)
          A convenience method that adds one or more customizable
          construction variables to a Variables object in one call;
          equivalent to calling [2411]Add multiple times. Each args member
          must be a tuple that contains the arguments for an individual
          call to the Add method using the "special case" form; the other
          calling styles (individual positional arguments and/or keyword
          arguments) are not supported.

opt.AddVariables(
    ("debug", "", 0),
    ("CC", "The C compiler"),
    ("VALIDATE", "An option for testing validation", "notset", validator, None),
)

   vars.FormatVariableHelpText(env, opt, help, default, actual, aliases)
          Returns a formatted string containing the printable help text
          for the single variable opt. All of the arguments must be
          supplied except aliases, which is optional. env is the
          construction environment containing the variable values, (env is
          not used by the standard implementation of
          FormatVariableHelpText); var is the name of the variable; help
          is the text of the initial help message when the variable was
          added to the Variables object; default is the default value
          assigned when the variable was added to the Variables object;
          actual is the value as assigned in env (which may be the same as
          default, if none of the input sources assign to the variable);
          and aliases are any alias names for the variable, if omitted
          defaults to an empty list.

          FormatVariableHelpText is normally not called directly, but by
          GenerateHelpText, which does the work of obtaining the necessary
          values. You can patch in your own function that takes the same
          function signature in order to customize the appearance of
          variable help messages. Example:

def my_format(env, var, help, default, actual):
    fmt = "\n%s: default=%s actual=%s (%s)\n"
    return fmt % (var, default, actual, help)

vars.FormatVariableHelpText = my_format

          Note that GenerateHelpText will not put any blank lines or extra
          characters between the entries, so you must add those characters
          to the returned string if you want the entries separated.

   vars.GenerateHelpText(env, [sort])
          Return a formatted string with the help text collected from all
          the variables configured in this Variables object. This string
          is suitable for passing in to the [2412]Help function. The
          generated string include an indication of the actual value in
          the environment given by env.

          If the optional sort parameter is set to a callable value, it is
          used as a comparison function to determine how to sort the added
          variables. This function must accept two arguments, compare
          them, and return a negative integer if the first is less-than
          the second, zero if equal, or a positive integer if
          greater-than. If sort is not callable, but evaluates true, an
          alphabetical sort is performed. The default is False (unsorted).

Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

def cmp(a, b):
    return (a > b) - (a < b)

Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env, sort=cmp))

   vars.Save(filename, env)
          Saves the currently set variables into a script file named by
          filename. This provides a way to cache particular variable
          settings for reuse. Only variables that are set to non-default
          values are saved. You can load these saved variables on a
          subsequent run by passing filename to the [2413]Variables
          function,

env = Environment()
vars = Variables(['variables.cache', 'custom.py'])
vars.Add(...)
vars.Update(env)
vars.Save('variables.cache', env)

   vars.UnknownVariables()
          Returns a dictionary containing any variables that were
          specified in the files and/or args parameters when
          [2414]Variables was called, but the object was not actually
          configured for. This information is not available until the
          [2415]Update method has run.

env = Environment(variables=vars)
for key, value in vars.UnknownVariables():
    print("unknown variable:  %s=%s" % (key, value))

   vars.Update(env, [args])
          Process the input sources recorded when the Variables object was
          initialized and update env with the customized construction
          variables. The names of any variables in the input sources that
          are not configured in the Variables object are recorded and may
          be retrieved using the [2416]UnknownVariables method.

          If the optional args argument is provided, it must be a
          dictionary of variables, which will be used in place of the one
          saved when the [2417]Variables object was created.

          Normally, Update is not called directly, but rather invoked
          indirectly by passing the Variables object to the
          [2418]Environment function:

env = Environment(..., variables=vars)

   A Variables object also makes available two data attributes that can be
   read for further information. These only have values if [2419]Update
   has previously run.

   vars.defaulted
          A list of variable names that were set in the construction
          environment from the default values in the variable descriptions
          - that is, variables that have a default value and were not
          defined in the input sources.

   vars.unknown
          A dictionary of variables that were specified in the input
          sources, but do not have matching variable definitions. This is
          the same information that is returned by the
          [2420]UnknownVariables method.

   Added in 4.9.0: the defaulted attribute.

   SCons provides five pre-defined variable types, accessible through
   factory functions that generate a tuple appropriate for directly
   passing to the [2421]Add or [2422]AddVariables methods.

   BoolVariable(key, help, default)
          Set up a Boolean variable named key. The variable will have a
          default value of default, and help will form the descriptive
          part of the help text. The variable will interpret the
          command-line values y, yes, t, true, 1, on and all as true, and
          the command-line values n, no, f, false, 0, off and none as
          false.

   EnumVariable(key, help, default, allowed_values, [map, ignorecase])
          Set up a variable named key whose value may only be chosen from
          a specified list ("enumeration") of values. The variable will
          have a default value of default and help will form the
          descriptive part of the help text. Any value that is not in
          allowed_values will raise an error, except that the optional map
          argument is a dictionary that can be used to map additional
          names into a particular name in the allowed_values list. If the
          optional ignorecase is 0 (the default), the values are
          considered case-sensitive. If ignorecase is 1, values will be
          matched case-insensitively. If ignorecase is 2, values will be
          matched case-insensitively, and all input values will be
          converted to lower case.

   ListVariable(key, help, default, names, [map, validator])
          Set up a variable named key whose value may be one or more
          choices from a specified list of values. The variable will have
          a default value of default, and help will form the descriptive
          part of the help text. Any value that is not in names or the
          special values all or none will raise an error. Use a comma
          separator to specify multiple values. default may be specified
          either as a string of comma-separated values, or as a Python
          list of values.

          The optional map argument is a dictionary that can be used to
          convert input values into specific legal values in the names
          list. (Note that the additional values accepted through the use
          of a map are not reflected in the generated help message).

          The optional validator argument can be used to specify a custom
          validator callback function, as described for [2423]Add. The
          default is to use an internal validator routine.

          Added in 4.8.0: the validator parameter.

   PackageVariable(key, help, default)
          Set up a variable named key to help control a build component,
          such as a software package. Similar to a [2424]BoolVariable, but
          can also specify a path string to provide additional information
          to the build, for example the path to a configuration file
          describing the package, or a directory containing the package
          headers and libraries. The variable will have a default value of
          default, and the help parameter will be used as the descriptive
          part of the help text.

          Any of the (case-insensitive) strings 1, yes, true, on, enable
          or search can be used to indicate the package is "enabled", and
          can also be used as the value of default. A value of boolean
          True is produced except for the special case described for a
          path string.

          Any of the (case-insensitive) strings 0, no, false, off or
          disable can be used to indicate the package is "disabled", and
          can also be used as the value of default. A value of boolean
          False is produced.

          A string which is neither an enabling or disabling string is
          considered a "path string". A path string can be given when
          specifying the variable, and can also be used as the value of
          default. A path string must refer to an existing filesystem
          path, but any further meaning is left to the build system to
          decide. The path string is produced. As a special case, if
          default is a path string, and the variable is specified with an
          enabling string, the default path string is produced, rather
          than True.

   PathVariable(key, help, default, [validator])
          Set up a variable named key to hold a path string. The variable
          will have a default value of default, and the help parameter
          will be used as the descriptive part of the help text.

          The optional validator parameter describes a callback function
          which will be called to verify that the specified path is
          acceptable. SCons supplies the following ready-made validators:

        PathVariable.PathExists
                Verify that the specified path exists (this the default
                behavior if no validator is supplied).

        PathVariable.PathIsFile
                Verify that the specified path exists and is a regular
                file.

        PathVariable.PathIsDir
                Verify that the specified path exists and is a directory.

        PathVariable.PathIsDirCreate
                Verify that the specified path exists and is a directory;
                if it does not exist, create the directory.

        PathVariable.PathAccept
                Accept the specific path name argument without validation,
                suitable for when you want your users to be able to
                specify a directory path that will be created as part of
                the build process, for example.

          You may supply your own validator function, which must accept
          three arguments: key, the name of the variable to be set; val,
          the specified value being checked; and env, the construction
          environment, and should raise an exception if the specified
          value is not acceptable.

   These functions make it convenient to create a number of variables with
   consistent behavior in a single call to the [2425]AddVariables method:
vars.AddVariables(
    BoolVariable(
        "warnings",
        help="compilation with -Wall and similar",
        default=True,
    ),
    EnumVariable(
        "debug",
        help="debug output and symbols",
        default="no",
        allowed_values=("yes", "no", "full"),
        map={},
        ignorecase=0,  # case-sensitive
    ),
    ListVariable(
        "shared",
        help="libraries to build as shared libraries",
        default="all",
        names=list_of_libs,
    ),
    PackageVariable(
        "x11",
        help="use X11 installed here (yes = search some places)",
        default="yes",
    ),
    PathVariable(
        "qtdir",
        help="where the root of Qt is installed",
        default=qtdir
    ),
    PathVariable(
        "foopath",
        help="where the foo library is installed",
        default=foopath,
        validator=PathVariable.PathIsDir,
    ),
)

Node Objects

   SCons represents objects that are the sources or targets of build
   operations as Nodes, which are internal data structures. There are a
   number of user-visible types of nodes: File Nodes, Directory Nodes,
   Value Nodes and Alias Nodes. Some of the node types have public
   attributes and methods, described below. Each of the node types has a
   global function and a matching environment method to create instances:
   [2426]File, [2427]Dir, [2428]Value and [2429]Alias.

Filesystem Nodes

   The [2430]File and [2431]Dir functions/methods return File Nodes and
   Directory Nodes, respectively. Such Filesystem Nodes represent build
   components that correspond to an entry in the computer's filesystem,
   whether or not such an entry exists at the time the Node is created.
   You do not usually need to explicitly create filesystem Nodes, since
   when you supply a string as a target or source of a Builder, SCons will
   create the Nodes as needed to populate the dependency graph. Builders
   return the target Node(s) in the form of a list, which you can then
   make use of. However, since filesystem Nodes have some useful public
   attributes and methods that you can use in SConscript files, it is
   sometimes appropriate to create them manually, outside the regular
   context of a Builder call.

   The following attributes provide information about a Node:

   node.path
          The build path of the given file or directory. This path is
          relative to the project top directory. The build path is the
          same as the source path if variant_dir is not being used.

   node.abspath
          The absolute build path of the given file or directory.

   node.relpath
          The build path of the given file or directory relative to the
          project top directory.

   node.srcnode()
          The srcnode method returns another File or Directory Node
          representing the source path of the given File or Directory
          Node.

   Examples:
# Get the current build dir's path, relative to top.
Dir('.').path

# Current dir's absolute path
Dir('.').abspath

# Current dir's path relative to the project top directory
Dir('.').relpath

# Next line is always '.', because it is the top dir's path relative to itself.
Dir('#.').path

# Source path of the given source file.
File('foo.c').srcnode().path

# Builders return lists of File objects:
foo = env.Program('foo.c')
print("foo will be built in", foo[0].path)

   Filesystem Node objects have methods to create new Filesystem Nodes
   relative to the original Node. There are also times when you may need
   to refer to an entry in a filesystem without knowing in advance whether
   it's a file or a directory. For those situations, there is an Entry
   method of filesystem node objects, which returns a Node that can
   represent either a file or a directory.

   If the original Node is a Directory Node, these methods will place the
   new Node within the directory the original Node represents:

   node.Dir(name)
          Returns a directory Node name which is a subdirectory of the
          directory represented by node.

   node.File(name)
          Returns a file Node name in the directory represented by node.

   node.Entry(name)
          Returns an unresolved Node name in the directory represented by
          node.

   If the original Node is a File Node, these methods will place the new
   Node in the same directory as the one the original Node represents:

   node.Dir(name)
          Returns a Node name for a directory in the parent directory of
          the file represented by node.

   node.File(name)
          Returns a Node name for a file in the parent directory of the
          file represented by node.

   node.Entry(name)
          Returns an unresolved Node name in the parent directory of the
          file represented by node.

   For example:
# Get a Node for a file within a directory
incl = Dir('include')
f = incl.File('header.h')

# Get a Node for a subdirectory within a directory
dist = Dir('project-3.2.1')
src = dist.Dir('src')

# Get a Node for a file in the same directory
cfile = File('sample.c')
hfile = cfile.File('sample.h')

# Combined example
docs = Dir('docs')
html = docs.Dir('html')
index = html.File('index.html')
css = index.File('app.css')

Value and Alias Nodes

   SCons provides two other Node types to represent object that will not
   have an equivalent filesystem entry. Such Nodes always need to be
   created explicitly.

   The [2432]Alias method returns an Alias Node. Aliases are virtual
   objects - they will not themselves result in physical objects being
   constructed, but are entered into the dependency graph related to their
   sources. An alias is checked for up to date by checking if its sources
   are up-to-date. An alias is built by making sure its sources have been
   built, and if any building took place, applying any Actions that are
   defined as part of the alias.

   An [2433]Alias call creates an entry in the alias namespace, which is
   used for disambiguation. If an alias source has a string valued name,
   it will be resolved to a filesystem entry Node, unless it is found in
   the alias namespace, in which case it is resolved to the matching alias
   Node. As a result, the order of Alias calls is significant. An alias
   can refer to another alias, but only if the other alias has previously
   been created.

   The [2434]Value method returns a Value Node. Value nodes are often used
   for generated data that will not have any corresponding filesystem
   entry, but will be used to determine whether a build target is
   out-of-date, or to include as part of a build Action. Common examples
   are timestamp strings, revision control version strings and other
   run-time generated strings.

   A Value Node can also be the target of a builder.

EXTENDING SCONS

   SCons is designed to be extensible through provided facilities, so
   changing the code of SCons itself is only rarely needed to customize
   its behavior. A number of the main operations use callable objects
   which can be supplemented by writing your own. Builders, Scanners and
   Tools each use a kind of plugin system, allowing you to easily drop in
   new ones. Information about creating [2435]Builder Objects and
   [2436]Scanner Objects appear in the following sections. The
   instructions SCons actually uses to construct things are called
   Actions, and it is easy to create Action Objects and hand them to the
   objects that need to know about those actions (besides Builders, see
   [2437]AddPostAction, [2438]AddPreAction and [2439]Alias for some
   examples of other places that take Actions). [2440]Action Objects are
   also described below. Adding new Tool modules is described in
   [2441]Tool Modules

Builder Objects

   scons can be extended to build additional types of targets by adding
   new Builder objects to a construction environment. In general, you
   should only need to add a new Builder object when you want to build a
   new type of file or other external target. For output file types scons
   already knows about, you can usually modify the behavior of premade
   Builders such as [2442]Program, [2443]Object or [2444]Library by
   changing the construction variables that control their behavior
   ([2445]$CC, [2446]$LINK, etc.). In this manner you can, for example,
   change the compiler to use, which is simpler and less error-prone than
   writing a new builder. The documentation for each Builder lists which
   construction variables it uses.

   Builder objects are created using the [2447]Builder factory function.
   Once created, a builder is added to a construction environment by
   registering it in the [2448]$BUILDERS dictionary in that environment
   (some of the examples in this section illustrate this). Doing so
   automatically triggers SCons to add a method with the name of the
   builder to the environment.

   The Builder function accepts the following keyword arguments:

   action
          The command used to build the target from the source. action may
          be a string representing a template command line to execute, a
          list of strings representing the command to execute with its
          arguments (suitable for enclosing white space in an argument), a
          dictionary mapping source file name suffixes to any combination
          of command line strings (if the builder should accept multiple
          source file extensions), a Python function, an Action object
          (see [2449]Action Objects) or a list of any of the above.

          An action function must accept three arguments: source, target
          and env. source is a list of source nodes; target is a list of
          target nodes; env is the construction environment to use for
          context.

          The action and generator arguments must not both be used for the
          same Builder.

   prefix
          The prefix to prepend to the target file name. prefix may be a
          string, a function (or other callable) that takes two arguments
          (a construction environment and a list of sources) and returns a
          prefix string, or a dictionary specifying a mapping from a
          specific source suffix (of the first source specified) to a
          corresponding target prefix string. For the dictionary form,
          both the source suffix (key) and target prefix (value)
          specifications may use environment variable substitution, and
          the target prefix may also be a callable object. The default
          target prefix may be indicated by a dictionary entry with a key
          of None.

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET", prefix="file-")

def gen_prefix(env, sources):
    return "file-" + env['PLATFORM'] + '-'

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET", prefix=gen_prefix)

b = Builder(
    "build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
    suffix={None: "file-", "$SRC_SFX_A": gen_prefix},
)

   suffix
          The suffix to append to the target file name. Specified in the
          same manner as for prefix above. If the suffix is a string, then
          scons prepends a '.' to the suffix if it's not already there.
          The string returned by the callable object or obtained from the
          dictionary is untouched, and you need to manually prepend a '.'
          if one is required.

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET", suffix="-file")

def gen_suffix(env, sources):
    return "." + env['PLATFORM'] + "-file"

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET", suffix=gen_suffix)
b = Builder(
    "build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
    suffix={None: ".sfx1", "$SRC_SFX_A": gen_suffix},
)

   ensure_suffix
          If set to a true value, ensures that targets will end in suffix.
          Thus, the suffix will also be added to any target strings that
          have a suffix that is not already suffix. The default behavior
          (also indicated by a false value) is to leave unchanged any
          target string that looks like it already has a suffix.

b1 = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET", suffix=".out")
b2 = Builder(
    "build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET", suffix=".out", ensure_suffix=True
)
env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS']['B1'] = b1
env['BUILDERS']['B2'] = b2

# Builds "foo.txt" because ensure_suffix is not set.
env.B1('foo.txt', 'foo.in')

# Builds "bar.txt.out" because ensure_suffix is set.
env.B2('bar.txt', 'bar.in')

   src_suffix
          The expected source file name suffix. src_suffix may be a string
          or a list of strings.

   target_scanner
          A Scanner object that will be invoked to find implicit
          dependencies for this target file. Use only to specify Scanner
          objects that find implicit dependencies based on the target file
          and construction environment, not for implicit dependencies
          based on source files (use [2450]source_scanner for those). See
          [2451]the section called "Scanner Objects" for information about
          creating your own Scanner objects.

   source_scanner
          A Scanner object that will be invoked to find implicit
          dependencies in any source files used to build this target file.
          Use to specify a scanner to find things like #include lines in
          source files. The pre-built DirScanner Scanner object may be
          used to indicate that this Builder should scan directory trees
          for on-disk changes to files that scons does not know about from
          other Builder or function calls. See [2452]the section called
          "Scanner Objects" for information about creating your own
          Scanner objects.

   target_factory
          A factory function that the Builder will use to turn any targets
          specified as strings into SCons Nodes. By default, SCons assumes
          that all targets are files (that is, the default factory is
          File). Other useful target_factory values include Dir for when a
          Builder creates a directory target, and Entry for when a Builder
          can create either a file or directory target.

          Example:

def my_mkdir(target, source, env):
    # target[0] will be a Dir node for 'new_directory'

MakeDirectoryBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, target_factory=Dir)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS={'MakeDirectory': MakeDirectoryBuilder})
env.MakeDirectory('new_directory', [])

          Note that the call to the MakeDirectory Builder needs to specify
          an empty source list to make the filename string represent the
          builder's target. SCons assumes a single positional argument to
          a builder is the source, and would try to deduce the target name
          from it, which, in the absence of an automatically-added prefix
          or suffix, would lead to a matching target and source name and a
          circular dependency.

   source_factory
          A factory function that the Builder will use to turn any sources
          specified as strings into SCons Nodes. By default, SCons assumes
          that all source are files (that is, the default factory is
          File). Other useful source_factory values include Dir for when a
          Builder uses a directory as a source, and Entry for when a
          Builder can use files or directories (or both) as sources.

          Example:

def collect(target, source, env):
    # target[0] will default to a File node for 'archive' (no target_factory)
    # source[0] will be a Dir node for 'directory_name'

CollectBuilder = Builder(action=collect, source_factory=Dir)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS={'Collect': CollectBuilder})
env.Collect('archive', 'directory_name')

   emitter
          A function or list of functions to manipulate the target and
          source lists before dependencies are established and the
          target(s) are actually built. emitter can also be a string
          containing a construction variable to expand to an emitter
          function or list of functions, or a dictionary mapping source
          file suffixes to emitter functions. (Only the suffix of the
          first source file is used to select the actual emitter function
          from an emitter dictionary.)

          A function passed as emitter must accept three arguments:
          source, target and env. source is a list of source nodes, target
          is a list of target nodes, env is the construction environment
          to use for context.

          An emitter must return a tuple containing two lists, the list of
          targets to be built by this builder, and the list of sources for
          this builder.

          Example:

def e(target, source, env):
    return target + ['foo.foo'], source + ['foo.src']

# Simple association of an emitter function with a Builder.
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE", emitter=e)

def e2(target, source, env):
    return target + ['bar.foo'], source + ['bar.src']

# Simple association of a list of emitter functions with a Builder.
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE", emitter=[e, e2])

# Calling an emitter function through a construction variable.
env = Environment(MY_EMITTER=e)
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE", emitter='$MY_EMITTER')

# Calling a list of emitter functions through a construction variable.
env = Environment(EMITTER_LIST=[e, e2])
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE", emitter='$EMITTER_LIST')

# Associating multiple emitters with different file
# suffixes using a dictionary.
def e_suf1(target, source, env):
    return target + ['another_target_file'], source

def e_suf2(target, source, env):
    return target, source + ['another_source_file']

b = Builder(
    action="my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
    emitter={'.suf1': e_suf1, '.suf2': e_suf2}
)

   multi
          Specifies whether this builder is allowed to be called multiple
          times for the same target file(s). The default is False, which
          means the builder can not be called multiple times for the same
          target file(s). Calling a builder multiple times for the same
          target simply adds additional source files to the target; it is
          not allowed to change the environment associated with the
          target, specify additional environment overrides, or associate a
          different builder with the target.

   env
          A construction environment that can be used to fetch source code
          using this Builder. (Note that this environment is not used for
          normal builds of normal target files, which use the environment
          that was used to call the Builder for the target file.)

   generator
          A function that returns a list of actions that will be executed
          to build the target(s) from the source(s). The returned
          action(s) may be an Action object, or anything that can be
          converted into an Action object (see the next section).

          A function passed as generator must accept four arguments:
          source, target, env and for_signature. source is a list of
          source nodes, target is a list of target nodes, env is the
          construction environment to use for context, and for_signature
          is a Boolean value that tells the function if it is being called
          for the purpose of generating a build signature (as opposed to
          actually executing the command). Since the build signature is
          used for rebuild determination, the function should omit those
          elements that do not affect whether a rebuild should be
          triggered if for_signature is true.

          Example:

def g(source, target, env, for_signature):
    return [["gcc", "-c", "-o"] + target + source]

b = Builder(generator=g)

          The generator and action arguments must not both be used for the
          same Builder.

   src_builder
          Specifies a builder to use when a source file name suffix does
          not match any of the suffixes of the builder. Using this
          argument produces a multi-stage builder.

   single_source
          Specifies that this builder expects exactly one source file per
          call. Giving more than one source file without target files
          results in implicitly calling the builder multiple times (once
          for each source given). Giving multiple source files together
          with target files results in a UserError exception.

   source_ext_match
          When the specified action argument is a dictionary, the default
          behavior when a builder is passed multiple source files is to
          make sure that the extensions of all the source files match. If
          it is legal for this builder to be called with a list of source
          files with different extensions, this check can be suppressed by
          setting source_ext_match to False or some other non-true value.
          In this case, scons will use the suffix of the first specified
          source file to select the appropriate action from the action
          dictionary.

          In the following example, the setting of source_ext_match
          prevents scons from exiting with an error due to the mismatched
          suffixes of foo.in and foo.extra.

b = Builder(action={'.in': 'build $SOURCES > $TARGET'}, source_ext_match=False)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'MyBuild': b})
env.MyBuild('foo.out', ['foo.in', 'foo.extra'])

   env
          A construction environment that can be used to fetch source code
          using this Builder. (Note that this environment is not used for
          normal builds of normal target files, which use the environment
          that was used to call the Builder for the target file.)

b = Builder(action="build < $SOURCE > $TARGET")
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('foo.out', 'foo.in', my_arg='xyzzy')

   chdir
          A directory from which scons will execute the action(s)
          specified for this Builder. If the chdir argument is a string or
          a directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory.
          If the chdir is not a string or Node and is non-zero, then scons
          will change to the target file's directory.

          Note that scons will not automatically modify its expansion of
          construction variables like $TARGET and $SOURCE when using the
          chdir keyword argument--that is, the expanded file names will
          still be relative to the project top directory, and consequently
          incorrect relative to the chdir directory. Builders created
          using chdir keyword argument, will need to use construction
          variable expansions like ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to
          use just the filename portion of the targets and source.

b = Builder(action="build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}", chdir=True)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in')

Warning

          Python only tracks one current directory location, even if there
          are multiple executing threads. This means that use of the chdir
          argument will not work with SCons in multi-threaded mode (the
          [2453]-j option), because individual worker threads spawned by
          SCons interfere with each other when they start changing
          directory.

   Any additional keyword arguments supplied when a Builder object is
   created (that is, when the [2454]Builder function is called) will be
   set in the executing construction environment when the Builder object
   is called. The canonical example here would be to set a construction
   variable to the repository of a source code system.

   Any such keyword arguments supplied when a Builder object is called
   will only be associated with the target created by that particular
   Builder call (and any other files built as a result of the call). These
   extra keyword arguments are passed to the following functions:
   [2455]command generator functions, [2456]function Actions, and
   [2457]emitter functions.

   When debugging errors in a custom builder method, remember that the
   builder's Action is executed asynchronously - the builder call in the
   SConscript only instructs SCons what you want built, while the actual
   building is scheduled later (if necessary) by the taskmaster. As a
   result, wrapping a builder call in a try block is not useful, as
   success in the builder call is not the same as the build itself
   succeeding. If necessary, code a builder's Action to exit with a useful
   error message indicating the problem in the SConscript file. Attempting
   programmatic recovery from build errors is rarely useful.

Action Objects

   The [2458]Builder factory function will turn its action keyword
   argument into an appropriate internal Action object, as will the
   [2459]Command function. You can also explicitly create Action objects
   for passing to Builder, or other functions that take actions as
   arguments, by calling the [2460]Action factory function. This may more
   efficient when multiple Builder objects need to do the same thing
   rather than letting each of those Builder objects create a separate
   Action object. It also allows more flexible configuration of an Action
   object. For example, to control the message printed when the action is
   taken you need to create the action object using Action.

   The Action factory function returns an appropriate object for the
   action represented by the type of the action argument (the first
   positional parameter):
     * If action is already an Action object, the object is simply
       returned.
     * If action is a string, a command-line Action is returned. If such a
       string begins with @, the command line is not printed. If the
       string begins with hyphen (-), the exit status from the specified
       command is ignored, allowing execution to continue even if the
       command reports failure:
Action('$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES')

# Doesn't print the line being executed.
Action('@build $TARGET $SOURCES')

# Ignores return value
Action('-build $TARGET $SOURCES')

     * If action is a list, then a list of Action objects is returned. An
       Action object is created as necessary for each element in the list.
       If an element within the list is itself a list, the embedded list
       is taken as the command and arguments to be executed via the
       command line. This allows white space to be enclosed in an argument
       rather than taken as a separator by defining a command in a list
       within a list:
Action([['cc', '-c', '-DWHITE SPACE', '-o', '$TARGET', '$SOURCES']])

     * If action is a callable object, a Function Action is returned. The
       callable must accept three keyword arguments: target, source and
       env. target is a Node object representing the target file, source
       is a Node object representing the source file and env is the
       construction environment used for building the target file.
       The target and source arguments may be lists of Node objects if
       there is more than one target file or source file. The actual
       target and source file name(s) may be retrieved from their Node
       objects via the built-in Python str function:
target_file_name = str(target)
source_file_names = [str(x) for x in source]

       The function should return 0 or None to indicate a successful build
       of the target file(s). The function may raise an exception or
       return a non-zero exit status to indicate an unsuccessful build.
def build_it(target=None, source=None, env=None):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

a = Action(build_it)

     * If action is not one of the above types, no action object is
       generated and Action returns None.

   The environment method form [2461]env.Action will expand construction
   variables in any argument strings, including action, at the time it is
   called, using the construction variables in the construction
   environment through which it was called. The global function form
   [2462]Action delays variable expansion until the Action object is
   actually used.

   The optional second argument to Action is used to control the output
   which is printed when the Action is actually performed. If this
   parameter is omitted, or if the value is an empty string, a default
   output depending on the type of the action is used. For example, a
   command-line action will print the executed command. The following
   argument types are accepted:
     * If the second argument is a string, or if the cmdstr keyword
       argument is supplied, the string defines what is printed.
       Substitution is performed on the string before it is printed. The
       string typically contains substitutable variables, notably
       $TARGET(S) and $SOURCE(S), or consists of just a single variable
       which is optionally defined somewhere else. SCons itself heavily
       uses the latter variant.
     * If the second argument is a function, or if the strfunction keyword
       argument is supplied, the function will be called to obtain the
       string to be printed when the action is performed. The function
       must accept three keyword arguments: target, source and env, with
       the same interpretation as for a callable action argument above.
       The function is responsible for handling any required
       substitutions.
     * If the second argument is None, or if cmdstr=None is supplied,
       output is suppressed entirely.

   The cmdstr and strfunction keyword arguments may not both be supplied
   in a single call to Action

   Printing of action strings is affected by the setting of
   [2463]$PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC.

   Examples:
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

def string_it(target, source, env):
    return "building '%s' from '%s'" % (target[0], source[0])

# Use a positional argument.
f = Action(build_it, string_it)
s = Action(build_it, "building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'")

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
f = Action(build_it, strfunction=string_it)
s = Action(build_it, cmdstr="building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'")

# You can provide a configurable variable.
l = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT')

   Any additional positional arguments, if present, may either be
   construction variables or lists of construction variables whose values
   will be included in the signature of the Action (the build signature)
   when deciding whether a target should be rebuilt because the action
   changed. Such variables may also be specified using the varlist keyword
   parameter; both positional and keyword forms may be present, and will
   be combined. This is necessary whenever you want a target to be rebuilt
   when a specific construction variable changes. This is not often needed
   for a string action, as the expanded variables will normally be part of
   the command line, but may be needed if a Python function action uses
   the value of a construction variable when generating the command line.
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the 'XXX' construction variable
    with open(target[0], 'w') as f:
        f.write(env['XXX'])
    return 0

# Use positional arguments.
a = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT', ['XXX'])

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
a = Action(build_it, varlist=['XXX'])

   The Action factory function can be passed the following optional
   keyword arguments to modify the Action object's behavior:

   chdir
          If chdir is true (the default is False), SCons will change
          directories before executing the action. If the value of chdir
          is a string or a directory Node, SCons will change to the
          specified directory. Otherwise, if chdir evaluates true, SCons
          will change to the target file's directory.

          Note that SCons will not automatically modify its expansion of
          construction variables like $TARGET and $SOURCE when using the
          chdir parameter - that is, the expanded file names will still be
          relative to the project top directory, and consequently
          incorrect relative to the chdir directory. Builders created
          using chdir keyword argument, will need to use construction
          variable expansions like ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to
          use just the filename portion of the targets and source.
          Example:

a = Action("build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}", chdir=True)

          If provided, must be a callable which accepts a single
          parameter, the exit status (or return value) from the specified
          action, and which returns an arbitrary or modified value. This
          can be used, for example, to specify that an Action object's
          return value should be ignored under special conditions and
          SCons should, therefore, consider that the action always
          succeeds. Example:

def always_succeed(s):
    # Always return 0, which indicates success.
    return 0

a = Action("build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}", exitstatfunc=always_succee
d)

   batch_key
          If provided, indicates that the Action can create multiple
          target files by processing multiple independent source files
          simultaneously. (The canonical example is "batch compilation" of
          multiple object files by passing multiple source files to a
          single invocation of a compiler such as Microsoft Visual C++. If
          the batch_key argument evaluates True and is not a callable
          object, the configured Action object will cause scons to collect
          all targets built with the Action object and configured with the
          same construction environment into single invocations of the
          Action object's command line or function. Command lines will
          typically want to use the $CHANGED_SOURCES construction variable
          (and possibly $CHANGED_TARGETS as well) to only pass to the
          command line those sources that have actually changed since
          their targets were built. Example:

a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=True)

          The batch_key argument may also be a callable function that
          returns a key that will be used to identify different "batches"
          of target files to be collected for batch building. A batch_key
          function must accept four parameters: action, env, target and
          source. The first parameter, action, is the active action
          object. The second parameter, env, is the construction
          environment configured for the target. The target and source
          parameters are the lists of targets and sources for the
          configured action.

          The returned key should typically be a tuple of values derived
          from the arguments, using any appropriate logic to decide how
          multiple invocations should be batched. For example, a batch_key
          function may decide to return the value of a specific
          construction variable from env which will cause scons to
          batch-build targets with matching values of that construction
          variable, or perhaps return the Python id() of the entire
          construction environment, in which case scons will batch-build
          all targets configured with the same construction environment.
          Returning None indicates that the particular target should not
          be part of any batched build, but instead will be built by a
          separate invocation of action's command or function. Example:

def batch_key(action, env, target, source):
    tdir = target[0].dir
    if tdir.name == 'special':
        # Don't batch-build any target
        # in the special/ subdirectory.
        return None
    return (id(action), id(env), tdir)
a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=batch_key)

Miscellaneous Action Functions

   SCons supplies Action functions that arrange for various common file
   and directory manipulations to be performed. These are similar in
   concept to "tasks" in the Ant build tool, although the implementation
   is slightly different. These functions do not actually perform the
   specified action at the time the function is called, but rather are
   factory functions which return an Action object that can be executed at
   the appropriate time.

   There are two natural ways that these Action Functions are intended to
   be used.

   First, if you need to perform the action at the time the SConscript
   file is being read, you can use the [2464]Execute global function:
Execute(Touch('file'))

   Second, you can use these functions to supply Actions in a list for use
   by the [2465]env.Command method. This can allow you to perform more
   complicated sequences of file manipulation without relying on
   platform-specific external commands:
env = Environment(TMPBUILD='/tmp/builddir')
env.Command(
    target='foo.out',
    source='foo.in',
    action=[
        Mkdir('$TMPBUILD'),
        Copy('$TMPBUILD', '${SOURCE.dir}'),
        "cd $TMPBUILD && make",
        Delete('$TMPBUILD'),
    ],
)

   Chmod(dest, mode)
          Returns an Action object that changes the permissions on the
          specified dest file or directory to the specified mode which can
          be octal or string, similar to the POSIX chmod command.
          Examples:

Execute(Chmod('file', 0o755))

env.Command(
    'foo.out',
    'foo.in',
    [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'), Chmod('$TARGET', 0o755)],
)

Execute(Chmod('file', "ugo+w"))

env.Command(
    'foo.out',
    'foo.in',
    [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'), Chmod('$TARGET', "ugo+w")],
)

          The behavior of Chmod is limited on Windows and on WebAssembly
          platforms, see the notes in the Python documentation for
          [2466]os.chmod, which is the underlying function.

   Copy(dest, src)
          Returns an Action object that will copy the src source file or
          directory to the dest destination file or directory. If src is a
          list, dest must be a directory if it already exists. Examples:

Execute(Copy('foo.output', 'foo.input'))

env.Command('bar.out', 'bar.in', Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'))

   Delete(entry, [must_exist])
          Returns an Action that deletes the specified entry, which may be
          a file or a directory tree. If a directory is specified, the
          entire directory tree will be removed. If the must_exist flag is
          set to a true value, then a Python error will be raised if the
          specified entry does not exist; the default is false, that is,
          the Action will silently do nothing if the entry does not exist.
          Examples:

Execute(Delete('/tmp/buildroot'))

env.Command(
    'foo.out',
    'foo.in',
    action=[
        Delete('${TARGET.dir}'),
        MyBuildAction,
    ],
)

Execute(Delete('file_that_must_exist', must_exist=True))

   Mkdir(name)
          Returns an Action that creates the directory name and all needed
          intermediate directories. name may also be a list of directories
          to create. Examples:

Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/outputdir'))

env.Command(
    'foo.out',
    'foo.in',
    action=[
        Mkdir('/tmp/builddir'),
        Copy('/tmp/builddir/foo.in', '$SOURCE'),
        "cd /tmp/builddir && make",
        Copy('$TARGET', '/tmp/builddir/foo.out'),
    ],
)

   Move(dest, src)
          Returns an Action that moves the specified src file or directory
          to the specified dest file or directory. Examples:

Execute(Move('file.destination', 'file.source'))

env.Command(
    'output_file',
    'input_file',
    action=[MyBuildAction, Move('$TARGET', 'file_created_by_MyBuildAction')],
)

   Touch(file)
          Returns an Action that updates the modification time on the
          specified file. Examples:

Execute(Touch('file_to_be_touched'))

env.Command('marker', 'input_file', action=[MyBuildAction, Touch('$TARGET')])

Variable Substitution

   Before executing a command, scons performs parameter expansion
   (substitution) on the string that makes up the action part of the
   builder. The format of a substitutable parameter is ${expression}. If
   expression refers to a variable, the braces in ${expression} can be
   omitted unless the variable name is immediately followed by a character
   that could either be interpreted as part of the name, or is Python
   syntax such as [ (for indexing/slicing) or . (for attribute access -
   see [2467]Special Attributes below).

   If expression refers to a construction variable, it (including the $ or
   ${ }) is replaced with the value of that variable in the construction
   environment at the time of execution. If expression looks like a
   variable name but is not defined in the construction environment it is
   replaced with an empty string. If expression refers to one of the
   [2468]Special Variables (see below) the corresponding value of the
   variable is substituted. expression may also be a Python expression to
   be evaluated. See [2469]Python Code Substitution below for a
   description.

   SCons uses the following rules when converting construction variables
   into command line strings:
     * If the value is a string it is interpreted as space delimited
       command line arguments.
     * If the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command line
       arguments. Each element of the list is converted to a string.
     * Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string and
       interpreted as a single command line argument.
     * Newline characters (\n) delimit lines. The newline parsing is done
       after all other parsing, so it is not possible for arguments (e.g.
       file names) to contain embedded newline characters.
     * For a literal $ use $$. For example, $$FOO will be left in the
       final string as $FOO.

   When a build action is executed, a hash of the command line is saved,
   together with other information about the target(s) built by the
   action, for future use in rebuild determination. This is called the
   build signature (or build action signature). The escape sequence $(
   subexpression $) may be used to indicate parts of a command line that
   may change without causing a rebuild--that is, which are not to be
   included when calculating the build signature. All text from $( up to
   and including the matching $) will be removed from the command line
   before it is added to the build signature while only the $( and $) will
   be removed before the command is executed. For example, the command
   line string:
"echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $). > $TARGET"

   would execute the command:
echo Last build occurred $TODAY. > $TARGET

   but the build signature added to any target files would be computed
   from:
echo Last build occurred  . > $TARGET

   While construction variables are normally directly substituted, if a
   construction variable has a value which is a callable Python object (a
   function, or a class with a __call__ method), that object is called
   during substitution. The callable must accept four arguments: target,
   source, env and for_signature. source is a list of source nodes, target
   is a list of target nodes, env is the construction environment to use
   for context, and for_signature is a boolean value that tells the
   callable if it is being called for the purpose of generating a build
   signature. Since the build signature is used for rebuild determination,
   variable elements that do not affect whether a rebuild should be
   triggered should be omitted from the returned string if for_signature
   is true. See $( and $) above for the syntax.

   SCons will insert whatever the callable returns into the expanded
   string:
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return "bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "bar baz"
env = Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="$FOO baz")

   As a reminder, substitution happens when $BAR is actually used in a
   builder action. The value of env['BAR'] will be exactly as it was set:
   "$FOO baz". This can make debugging tricky, as the substituted result
   is not available at the time the SConscript files are being interpreted
   and thus not available to the print function. However, you can perform
   the substitution on demand by calling the [2470]env.subst method for
   this purpose.

   You can use this feature to pass arguments to a callable variable by
   creating a callable class that stores passed arguments in the instance,
   and then uses them (in the __call__ method) when the instance is
   called. Note that in this case, the entire variable expansion must be
   enclosed by curly braces so that the arguments will be associated with
   the instantiation of the class:
class foo:
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
        return self.arg + " bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "my argument bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="${FOO('my argument')} baz")

Substitution: Special Variables

   Besides regular construction variables, scons provides the following
   Special Variables for use in expanding commands:

   $CHANGED_SOURCES
          The file names of all sources of the build command that have
          changed since the target was last built.

   $CHANGED_TARGETS
          The file names of all targets that would be built from sources
          that have changed since the target was last built.

   $SOURCE
          The file name of the source of the build command, or the file
          name of the first source if multiple sources are being built.

   $SOURCES
          The file names of the sources of the build command.

   $TARGET
          The file name of the target being built, or the file name of the
          first target if multiple targets are being built.

   $TARGETS
          The file names of all targets being built.

   $UNCHANGED_SOURCES
          The file names of all sources of the build command that have not
          changed since the target was last built.

   $UNCHANGED_TARGETS
          The file names of all targets that would be built from sources
          that have not changed since the target was last built.

   These names are reserved and may not be assigned to or used as
   construction variables. SCons computes them in a context-dependent
   manner and they are not retrieved from a construction environment.

   For example, the following builder call:
env = Environment(CC='cc')
env.Command(
    target=['foo'],
    source=['foo.c', 'bar.c'],
    action='@echo $CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES'
)

   would produce the following output:
cc -c -o foo foo.c bar.c

   In the previous example, a string ${SOURCES[1]} would expand to: bar.c.

Substitution: Special Attributes

   A variable name may have the following modifiers appended within the
   enclosing curly braces to access properties of the interpolated string.
   These are known as special attributes.
   base - The base path of the file name, including the directory path but
   excluding any suffix.
   dir - The name of the directory in which the file exists.
   file - The file name, minus any directory portion.
   filebase - Like file but minus its suffix.
   suffix - Just the file suffix.
   abspath - The absolute path name of the file.
   relpath - The path name of the file relative to the project top
   directory.
   posix - The path with directories separated by forward slashes (/).
   Sometimes necessary on Windows systems when a path references a file on
   other (POSIX) systems.
   windows - The path with directories separated by backslashes (\\).
   Sometimes necessary on POSIX-style systems when a path references a
   file on other (Windows) systems. win32 is a (deprecated) synonym for
   windows.
   srcpath - The directory and file name to the source file linked to this
   file through VariantDir(). If this file isn't linked, it just returns
   the directory and filename unchanged.
   srcdir - The directory containing the source file linked to this file
   through VariantDir(). If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
   directory part of the filename.
   rsrcpath - The directory and file name to the source file linked to
   this file through VariantDir(). If the file does not exist locally but
   exists in a Repository, the path in the Repository is returned. If this
   file isn't linked, it just returns the directory and filename
   unchanged.
   rsrcdir - The Repository directory containing the source file linked to
   this file through VariantDir(). If this file isn't linked, it just
   returns the directory part of the filename.

   For example, the specified target will expand as follows for the
   corresponding modifiers:
$TARGET              => sub/dir/file.x
${TARGET.base}       => sub/dir/file
${TARGET.dir}        => sub/dir
${TARGET.file}       => file.x
${TARGET.filebase}   => file
${TARGET.suffix}     => .x
${TARGET.abspath}    => /top/dir/sub/dir/file.x
${TARGET.relpath}    => sub/dir/file.x

$TARGET              => ../dir2/file.x
${TARGET.abspath}    => /top/dir2/file.x
${TARGET.relpath}    => ../dir2/file.x

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='sub/dir')
$SOURCE              => sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.srcpath}    => src/file.x
${SOURCE.srcdir}     => src

Repository('/usr/repository')
$SOURCE              => sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcpath}   => /usr/repository/src/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcdir}    => /usr/repository/src

   Some modifiers can be combined, like ${TARGET.srcpath.base),
   ${TARGET.file.suffix}, etc.

Python Code Substitution

   If a substitutable expression using the notation ${expression} does not
   appear to match one of the other substitution patterns, it is evaluated
   as a Python expression. This uses Python's eval function, with the
   globals parameter set to the current environment's set of construction
   variables, and the result substituted in. So in the following case:
env.Command(
    'foo.out', 'foo.in', "echo ${COND==1 and 'FOO' or 'BAR'} > $TARGET"
)

   the command executed will be either
echo FOO > foo.out

   or
echo BAR > foo.out

   according to the current value of env['COND'] when the command is
   executed. The evaluation takes place when the target is being built,
   not when the SConscript is being read. So if env['COND'] is changed
   later in the SConscript, the final value will be used.

   Here's a more complete example. Note that all of COND, FOO, and BAR are
   construction variables, and their values are substituted into the final
   command. FOO is a list, so its elements are interpolated separated by
   spaces.
env=Environment()
env['COND'] = 1
env['FOO'] = ['foo1', 'foo2']
env['BAR'] = 'barbar'
env.Command(
    'foo.out', 'foo.in', "echo ${COND==1 and FOO or BAR} > $TARGET"
)

   will execute:
echo foo1 foo2 > foo.out

   In point of fact, Python expression evaluation is how the special
   attributes are substituted: they are simply attributes of the Python
   objects that represent $TARGET, $SOURCES, etc., which SCons passes to
   eval which returns the value.

Caution

   Use of the Python eval function is considered to have security
   implications, since, depending on input sources, arbitrary unchecked
   strings of code can be executed by the Python interpreter. Although
   SCons makes use of it in a somewhat restricted context, you should be
   aware of this issue when using the ${python-expression-for-subst} form.

Scanner Objects

   Scanner objects are used to scan specific file types for implicit
   dependencies, for example embedded preprocessor/compiler directives
   that cause other files to be included during processing. SCons has a
   number of pre-built Scanner objects, so it is usually only necessary to
   set up Scanners for new file types. You do this by calling the
   [2471]Scanner factory function. Scanner accepts the following
   arguments. Only function is required; the rest are optional:

   function
          A function which can process ("scan") a given Node (usually a
          file) and return a list of Nodes representing any implicit
          dependencies (usually files) which will be tracked for the Node.
          The function must accept three required arguments, node, env and
          path, and an optional fourth, arg. node is the internal SCons
          node representing the file to scan, env is the construction
          environment to use during the scan, and path is a tuple of
          directories that can be searched for files, as generated by the
          optional scanner [2472]path_function. If the [2473]argument
          parameter was supplied when the Scanner object was created, it
          is passed as the arg parameter to the scanner function when it
          is called. Since argument is optional, the scanner function may
          be called without an arg parameter.

          The scanner function can make use of str(node) to fetch the name
          of the file, node.dir to fetch the directory the file is in,
          node.get_contents() to fetch the contents of the file as bytes
          or node.get_text_contents() to fetch the contents of the file as
          text.

          The scanner function should account for any directories listed
          in the path parameter when determining the existence of possible
          dependencies. External tools such as the C/C++ preprocessor are
          given lists of directories to search for source file inclusion
          directives (e.g. #include "myheader.h"). That list is generated
          from the relevant path variable (e.g. [2474]$CPPPATH for C/C++).
          The Scanner can be directed to pass the same list on to the
          scanner function via the path parameter so it can search in the
          same places. The Scanner is enabled to pass this list via the
          [2475]path_function argument at Scanner creation time.

          Instead of a scanner function, you can supply a dictionary as
          the function parameter. The dictionary must map keys (such as
          file suffixes) to other Scanner objects. A Scanner created this
          way serves as a dispatcher: the Scanner's [2476]skeys parameter
          is automatically populated with the dictionary's keys,
          indicating that the Scanner handles Nodes which would be
          selected by those keys; the mapping is then used to pass the
          file on to a different Scanner that would not have been selected
          to handle that Node based on its own skeys.

          Note that the file to scan is not guaranteed to exist at the
          time the scanner is called - it could be a generated file which
          has not been generated yet - so the scanner function must be
          tolerant of that.

          While many scanner functions operate on source code files by
          looking for known patterns in the code, they can really do
          anything they need to. For example, the [2477]Program Builder is
          assigned a [2478]target_scanner which examines the list of
          libraries supplied for the build ([2479]$LIBS) and decides
          whether to add them as dependencies, it does not look inside the
          built binary.

          It is up to the scanner function to decide whether or not to
          generate an SCons dependency for candidates identified by
          scanning. Dependencies are a key part of SCons operation,
          enabling both rebuild determination and correct ordering of
          builds. It is particularly important that generated files which
          are dependencies are added into the Node graph, or
          use-before-create failures are likely. However, not everything
          may need to be tracked as a dependency. In some cases,
          implementation-provided header files change infrequently but are
          included very widely, so tracking them in the SCons node graph
          could become quite expensive for limited benefit - consider for
          example the C standard header file string.h. The scanner
          function is not passed any special information to help make this
          choice, so the decision-making encoded in the scanner function
          must be carefully considered.

   name
          The name to use for the Scanner. This is mainly used to identify
          the Scanner internally. The default value is "NONE".

   argument
          If specified, will be passed to the scanner function function
          and the path function path_function when called, as the optional
          parameter each of those functions takes.

   skeys
          Scanner key(s) indicating the file types this scanner is
          associated with. Used internally to select an appropriate
          scanner. In the usual case of scanning for file names, this
          argument will be a list of suffixes for the different file types
          that this Scanner knows how to scan. If skeys is a string, it
          will be expanded into a list by the current environment.

   path_function
          If specified, a function to generate paths to pass to the
          scanner function to search while generating dependencies. The
          function must take five arguments: a construction environment, a
          Node for the directory containing the SConscript file in which
          the first target was defined, a list of target nodes, a list of
          source nodes, and the value of argument if it was supplied when
          the Scanner was created (since argument is optional, the
          function may be called without this argument, the path_function
          should be prepared for this). Must return a tuple of directories
          that can be searched for files to be returned by this Scanner
          object.

          The [2480]FindPathDirs function can be called to return a
          ready-made path_function for a given construction variable name,
          which is often easier than writing your own function from
          scratch. For example, path_function=FindPathDirs('CPPPATH')
          means the scanner function will be called with the paths
          extracted from $CPPPATH in the construction environment env, and
          passed as the path parameter to the scanner function.

   node_class
          The class of Node that should be returned by this Scanner
          object. Any strings or other objects returned by the scanner
          function that are not of this class will be run through the
          function supplied by the node_factory argument. A value of None
          can be supplied to indicate no conversion; the default is to
          return File nodes.

   node_factory
          A Python function that will take a string or other object and
          turn it into the appropriate class of Node to be returned by
          this Scanner object, as indicated by node_class.

   scan_check
          A Python function that takes two arguments, a Node (file) and a
          construction environment, and returns whether the Node should,
          in fact, be scanned for dependencies. This check can be used to
          eliminate unnecessary calls to the scanner function when, for
          example, the underlying file represented by a Node does not yet
          exist.

   recursive
          Specifies whether this scanner should be re-invoked on the
          dependency files returned by the scanner. If omitted, the Node
          subsystem will only invoke the scanner on the file being scanned
          and not recurse. Recursion is needed when the files returned by
          the scanner may themselves contain further file dependencies, as
          in the case of preprocessor #include lines. A value that
          evaluates true enables recursion; recursive may be a callable
          function, in which case it will be called with a list of Nodes
          found and should return a list of Nodes that should be scanned
          recursively; this can be used to select a specific subset of
          Nodes for additional scanning.

   Once created, a Scanner can be added to an environment by setting it in
   the [2481]$SCANNERS list, which automatically triggers SCons to also
   add it to the environment as a method. However, usually a scanner is
   not truly standalone, but needs to be plugged in to the existing
   selection mechanism for deciding how to scan source files based on
   filename extensions. For this, SCons has a global SourceFileScanner
   object that is used by the [2482]Object, [2483]SharedObject and
   [2484]StaticObject builders to decide which scanner should be used. You
   can use the SourceFileScanner.add_scanner() method to add your own
   Scanner object to the SCons infrastructure that builds target programs
   or libraries from a list of source files of different types:
def xyz_scan(node, env, path):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    # Scan the contents and return the included files.

XYZScanner = Scanner(xyz_scan)

SourceFileScanner.add_scanner('.xyz', XYZScanner)

env.Program('my_prog', ['file1.c', 'file2.f', 'file3.xyz'])

Tool Modules

   Custom tools can be added to a project either by placing them in the
   site_tools subdirectory of a configured site directory, or in a
   location specified by the toolpath keyword argument to
   [2485]Environment. You have to arrange to call a tool to put it into
   effect, either as part of the list given to the tools keyword argument
   at construction environment initialization, or by calling
   [2486]env.Tool.

   The toolpath parameter takes a list of path strings, and the tools
   parameter takes a list of tools, which are often strings:
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'foo'], toolpath=['tools'])

   This looks for a tool specification module foo in directory tools and
   in the standard locations, as well as using the ordinary default tools
   for the platform.

   When looking up tool specification modules, directories specified via
   toolpath are considered before the existing tool path (site_tools
   subdirectories of the default or specified site directories), which are
   in turn considered before built-in tools. For example, adding a tool
   specification module gcc.py to the toolpath directory would override
   the built-in [2487]gcc tool. The toolpath is saved in the environment
   and will be used by subsequent calls to the [2488]env.Tool method, as
   well as by [2489]env.Clone.
base = Environment(toolpath=['custom_path'])
derived = base.Clone(tools=['custom_tool'])
derived.CustomBuilder()

   A tool specification module is a form of Python module, looked up
   internally using the Python import mechanism, so a tool can consist
   either of a single Python file taking the name of the tool (e.g.
   mytool.py) or a directory taking the name of the tool (e.g. mytool/)
   which contains at least an __init__.py file. A tool specification
   module has two required entry points:

   generate(env, **kwargs)
          Modify the construction environment env to set up necessary
          construction variables, Builders, Emitters, etc., so the
          facilities represented by the tool can be executed. Take care
          not to overwrite construction variables which may have been
          explicitly set by the user; retain and/or append instead. For
          example:

def generate(env):
    ...
    if 'MYTOOL' not in env:
        env['MYTOOL'] = env.Detect("mytool")
    flags = env.get('MYTOOLFLAGS', SCons.Util.CLVar())
    env.AppendUnique(MYTOOLFLAGS='--myarg')
    ...

          The generate function may use any keyword arguments that the
          user supplies via kwargs to vary its initialization.

   exists(env)
          Return a truthy value if the tool can be called in the context
          of env, else return a falsy value. Usually this means looking up
          one or more known programs using the PATH from the supplied env,
          but the tool can make the exists decision in any way it chooses.

Note

   At the moment, user-added tools do not automatically have their exists
   function called. As a result, it is recommended that the generate
   function be defensively coded - that is, do not rely on any necessary
   existence checks already having been performed. This is expected to be
   a temporary limitation, and the exists function should still be
   provided.

   An element of the tools list may also be a function or other callable
   object (including a Tool object returned by a previous call to
   [2490]Tool) in which case the [2491]Environment function will directly
   call that object to update the new construction environment. No tool
   lookup is done in this case.
def my_tool(env):
    env['XYZZY'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(tools=[my_tool])

   An element of the tools list may also be a two-element list or tuple of
   the form (toolname, kw_dict). SCons searches for the tool specification
   module toolname as described above, and passes kw_dict, which must be a
   dictionary, as keyword arguments to the tool's generate function. The
   generate function can use those arguments to modify the tool's behavior
   by setting up the environment in different ways or otherwise changing
   its initialization.
# in tools/my_tool.py:
def generate(env, **kwargs):
    # Sets MY_TOOL to the value of keyword 'arg1' or '1' if not supplied
    env['MY_TOOL'] = kwargs.get('arg1', '1')

def exists(env):
    return True

# in SConstruct:
env = Environment(
    tools=['default', ('my_tool', {'arg1': 'abc'})], toolpath=['tools']
)

   The tool specification (my_tool in the example) can use the
   [2492]$PLATFORM variable from the construction environment it is passed
   to customize the tool for different platforms.

   Tools can be "nested" - that is, they can be located within a
   subdirectory in the toolpath. A nested tool name uses a dot to
   represent a directory separator
# namespaced builder
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy(), tools=['SubDir1.SubDir2.SomeTool'])
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

# Search Paths
# SCons\Tool\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool.py
# SCons\Tool\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool\__init__.py
# .\site_scons\site_tools\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool.py
# .\site_scons\site_tools\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool\__init__.py

SYSTEM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR

   scons and its configuration files are very portable, due largely to its
   implementation in Python. There are, however, a few portability issues
   waiting to trap the unwary.

.C File Suffix

   scons handles the upper-case .C file suffix differently, depending on
   the capabilities of the underlying system. On a case-sensitive system
   such as Linux or UNIX, scons treats a file with a .C suffix as a C++
   source file. On a case-insensitive system such as Windows, scons treats
   a file with a .C suffix as a C source file.

Fortran File Suffixes

   There are several ways source file suffixes impact the behavior of
   SCons when working with Fortran language code (not all are
   system-specific, but they are included here for completeness).

   As the Fortran language has evolved through multiple standards
   editions, projects might have a need to handle files from different
   language generations differently. To this end, SCons dispatches to a
   different compiler dialect setup (expressed as a set of construction
   variables) depending on the file suffix. By default, all of these
   setups start out the same, but individual construction variables can be
   modified as needed to tune a given dialect. Each of these dialects has
   a tool specification module whose documentation describes the
   construction variables associated with that dialect: .f (as well as
   .for and .ftn) in [2493]fortran; (construction variables start with
   FORTRAN) .f77 in [2494]f77; (construction variables start with F77)
   .f90 in [2495]f90; (construction variables start with F90) .f95 in
   [2496]f95; (construction variables start with F95) .f03 in [2497]f03;
   (construction variables start with F03) .f08 in [2498]f08 (construction
   variables start with F08).

   While SCons recognizes multiple internal dialects based on filename
   suffixes, the convention of various available Fortran compilers is to
   assign an actual meaning to only two of these suffixes: .f (as well as
   .for and .ftn) refers to the fixed-format source code that was the only
   available option in FORTRAN 77 and earlier, and .f90 refers to
   free-format source code which became available as of the Fortran 90
   standard. Some compilers recognize suffixes which correspond to Fortran
   specifications later than F90 as equivalent to .f90 for this purpose,
   while some do not - check the documentation for your compiler. An
   occasionally suggested policy suggestion is to use only .f and .f90 as
   Fortran filename suffixes. The fixed/free form determination can
   usually be controlled explicitly with compiler flags (e.g. -ffixed-form
   for gfortran), overriding any assumption that may be made based on the
   source file suffix.

   The source file suffix does not imply conformance with the
   similarly-named Fortran standard - a suffix of .f08 does not mean you
   are compiling specifically for Fortran 2008. Normally, compilers
   provide command-line options for making this selection (e.g. -std=f2008
   for gfortran).

   For dialects from F90 on (including the generic FORTRAN dialect), a
   suffix of .mod is recognized for Fortran modules. These files are a
   side effect of compiling a Fortran source file containing module
   declarations, and must be available when other code which declares that
   it uses the module is processed. SCons does not currently have
   integrated support for submodules, introduced in the Fortran 2008
   standard - the invoked compiler will produce results, but SCons will
   not recognize .smod files as tracked objects.

   On a case-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX, a file with a an
   upper-cased suffix from the set .F, .FOR, .FTN, .F90, .F95, .F03 and
   .F08 is treated as a Fortran source file which shall first be run
   through the standard C preprocessor. The lower-cased versions of these
   suffixes do not trigger this behavior. On systems which do not
   distinguish between upper and lower case in filenames, this behavior is
   not available, but files suffixed with either .FPP or .fpp are always
   passed to the preprocessor first. This matches the convention of
   gfortran from the GNU Compiler Collection, and also followed by certain
   other Fortran compilers. For these two suffixes, the generic FORTRAN
   dialect will be selected.

   SCons itself does not invoke the preprocessor, that is handled by the
   compiler, but it adds construction variables which are applicable to
   the preprocessor run. You can see this difference by examining
   [2499]$FORTRANPPCOM and [2500]$FORTRANPPCOMSTR which are used instead
   of [2501]$FORTRANCOM and [2502]$FORTRANCOMSTR for that dialect.

Windows: Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs. Windows Pythons

   Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities that let users work on a
   Windows system using a POSIX-like environment. The Cygwin tools,
   including Cygwin Python, do this, in part, by sharing an ability to
   interpret POSIX-style path names. For example, the Cygwin tools will
   internally translate a Cygwin path name like /cygdrive/c/mydir to an
   equivalent Windows pathname of C:/mydir (equivalent to C:\mydir).

   Versions of Python that are built for native Windows execution, such as
   the python.org and ActiveState versions, do not understand the Cygwin
   path name semantics. This means that using a native Windows version of
   Python to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools (such as gcc,
   bison and flex) may yield unpredictable results. "Mixing and matching"
   in this way can be made to work, but it requires careful attention to
   the use of path names in your SConscript files.

   In practice, users can sidestep the issue by adopting the following
   guidelines: When using Cygwin's gcc for compiling, use the
   Cygwin-supplied Python interpreter to run scons; when using Microsoft
   Visual C++ (or some other "native" Windows compiler) use the
   python.org, Microsoft Store, ActiveState or other native version of
   Python to run scons.

   This discussion largely applies to the msys2 environment as well (with
   the use of the mingw compiler toolchain), in particular the
   recommendation to use the msys2 version of Python if running scons from
   inside an msys2 shell.

Windows: scons.bat file

   On Windows, if scons is executed via a wrapper scons.bat batch file,
   there are (at least) two ramifications. Note this is no longer the
   default - scons installed via Python's pip installer will have a
   scons.exe which does not have these limitations:

   First, Windows command-line users that want to use variable assignment
   on the command line may have to put double quotes around the
   assignments, otherwise the Windows command shell will consume those as
   arguments to itself, not to scons:
scons "FOO=BAR" "BAZ=BLEH"

   Second, the Cygwin shell does not recognize typing scons at the command
   line prompt as referring to this wrapper. You can work around this
   either by executing scons.bat (including the extension) from the Cygwin
   command line, or by creating a wrapper shell script named scons which
   invokes scons.bat.

MinGW

   The MinGW bin directory must be in your PATH environment variable or
   the ['ENV']['PATH'] construction variable for scons to detect and use
   the MinGW tools. When running under the native Windows Python
   interpreter, scons will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin tools,
   if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin
   directories in the PATH variable. If you have both MSVC and MinGW
   installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC, then you must
   explicitly tell scons to use MinGW by passing tools=['mingw'] to the
   Environment function, because scons will prefer the MSVC tools over the
   MinGW tools.

ENVIRONMENT

   In general, scons is not controlled by environment variables set in the
   shell used to invoke it, leaving it up to the SConscript file author to
   import those if desired. However, the following variables are imported
   by scons itself if set:

   SCONS_LIB_DIR
          Specifies the directory that contains the scons Python module
          directory. Normally scons can deduce this, but in some
          circumstances, such as working with a source release, it may be
          necessary to specify (for example,
          /home/aroach/scons-src-0.01/src/engine).

   SCONSFLAGS
          A string containing options that will be used by scons in
          addition to those passed on the command line. Can be used to
          reduce frequent retyping of common options. The contents of
          SCONSFLAGS are considered before any passed command line
          options, so the command line can be used to override SCONSFLAGS
          options if necessary.

   SCONS_CACHE_MSVC_CONFIG
          (Windows only). If set, save the shell environment variables
          generated when setting up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
          (and/or Build Tools) to a cache file, to give these settings
          persistence across scons invocations. Generating this
          information is relatively expensive, so using this option may
          aid performance where scons is run often, such as Continuous
          Integration setups.

          If set to a True-like value ("1", "true" or "True") will cache
          to a file named scons_msvc_cache.json in the user's home
          directory. If set to a pathname, will use that pathname for the
          cache.

          Note: this implementation may still be somewhat fragile. In case
          of problems, remove the cache file - recreating with fresh info
          normally resolves any issues. SCons ignores failures reading or
          writing the cache file and will silently revert to non-cached
          behavior in such cases.

          New in 3.1 (experimental). The default cache file name was
          changed to its present value in 4.4, and contents were expanded.

   QTDIR
          If using the [2503]qt tool, this is the path to the Qt
          installation to build against. SCons respects this setting
          because it is a long-standing convention in the Qt world, where
          multiple Qt installations are possible.
