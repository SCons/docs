Preface

   Thank you for taking the time to read about SCons. SCons is a
   next-generation software construction tool, or make tool--that is, a
   software utility for building software (or other files) and keeping
   built software up-to-date whenever the underlying input files change.

   The most distinctive thing about SCons is that its configuration files
   are actually scripts, written in the Python programming language. This
   is in contrast to most alternative build tools, which typically invent
   a new language to configure the build. SCons still has a learning
   curve, of course, because you have to know what functions to call to
   set up your build properly, but the underlying syntax used should be
   familiar to anyone who has ever looked at a Python script.

   Paradoxically, using Python as the configuration file format makes
   SCons easier for non-programmers to learn than the cryptic languages of
   other build tools, which are usually invented by programmers for other
   programmers. This is in no small part due to the consistency and
   readability that are hallmarks of Python. It just so happens that
   making a real, live scripting language the basis for the configuration
   files makes it a snap for more accomplished programmers to do more
   complicated things with builds, as necessary.
     __________________________________________________________________

1. SCons Principles

   There are a few overriding principles we try to live up to in designing
   and implementing SCons:

   Correctness
          First and foremost, by default, SCons guarantees a correct build
          even if it means sacrificing performance a little. We strive to
          guarantee the build is correct regardless of how the software
          being built is structured, how it may have been written, or how
          unusual the tools are that build it.

   Performance
          Given that the build is correct, we try to make SCons build
          software as quickly as possible. In particular, wherever we may
          have needed to slow down the default SCons behavior to guarantee
          a correct build, we also try to make it easy to speed up SCons
          through optimization options that let you trade off guaranteed
          correctness in all end cases for a speedier build in the usual
          cases.

   Convenience
          SCons tries to do as much for you out of the box as reasonable,
          including detecting the right tools on your system and using
          them correctly to build the software.

   In a nutshell, we try hard to make SCons just "do the right thing" and
   build software correctly, with a minimum of hassles.
     __________________________________________________________________

2. A Caveat About This Guide's Completeness

   One word of warning as you read through this Guide: Like too much Open
   Source software out there, the SCons documentation isn't always kept
   up-to-date with the available features. In other words, there's a lot
   that SCons can do that isn't yet covered in this User's Guide. (Come to
   think of it, that also describes a lot of proprietary software, doesn't
   it?)

   Although this User's Guide isn't as complete as we'd like it to be, our
   development process does emphasize making sure that the SCons man page
   is kept up-to-date with new features. So if you're trying to figure out
   how to do something that SCons supports but can't find enough (or any)
   information here, it would be worth your while to look at the man page
   to see if the information is covered there. And if you do, maybe you'd
   even consider contributing a section to the User's Guide so the next
   person looking for that information won't have to go through the same
   thing...?

3. Acknowledgements

   SCons would not exist without a lot of help from a lot of people, many
   of whom may not even be aware that they helped or served as
   inspiration. So in no particular order, and at the risk of leaving out
   someone:

   First and foremost, SCons owes a tremendous debt to Bob Sidebotham, the
   original author of the classic Perl-based Cons tool which Bob first
   released to the world back around 1996. Bob's work on Cons classic
   provided the underlying architecture and model of specifying a build
   configuration using a real scripting language. My real-world experience
   working on Cons informed many of the design decisions in SCons,
   including the improved parallel build support, making Builder objects
   easily definable by users, and separating the build engine from the
   wrapping interface.

   Greg Wilson was instrumental in getting SCons started as a real project
   when he initiated the Software Carpentry design competition in February
   2000. Without that nudge, marrying the advantages of the Cons classic
   architecture with the readability of Python might have just stayed no
   more than a nice idea.

   The entire SCons team have been absolutely wonderful to work with, and
   SCons would be nowhere near as useful a tool without the energy,
   enthusiasm and time people have contributed over the past few years.
   The "core team" of Chad Austin, Anthony Roach, Bill Deegan, Charles
   Crain, Steve Leblanc, Greg Noel, Gary Oberbrunner, Greg Spencer and
   Christoph Wiedemann have been great about reviewing my (and other)
   changes and catching problems before they get in the code base. Of
   particular technical note: Anthony's outstanding and innovative work on
   the tasking engine has given SCons a vastly superior parallel build
   model; Charles has been the master of the crucial Node infrastructure;
   Christoph's work on the Configure infrastructure has added crucial
   Autoconf-like functionality; and Greg has provided excellent support
   for Microsoft Visual Studio.

   Special thanks to David Snopek for contributing his underlying
   "Autoscons" code that formed the basis of Christoph's work with the
   Configure functionality. David was extremely generous in making this
   code available to SCons, given that he initially released it under the
   GPL and SCons is released under a less-restrictive MIT-style license.

   Thanks to Peter Miller for his splendid change management system,
   Aegis, which has provided the SCons project with a robust development
   methodology from day one, and which showed me how you could integrate
   incremental regression tests into a practical development cycle (years
   before eXtreme Programming arrived on the scene).

   And last, thanks to Guido van Rossum for his elegant scripting
   language, which is the basis not only for the SCons implementation, but
   for the interface itself.

Chapter 1. Building and Installing SCons

   This chapter will take you through the basic steps of installing SCons
   on your system, and building SCons if you don't have a pre-built
   package available (or simply prefer the flexibility of building it
   yourself). Before that, however, this chapter will also describe the
   basic steps involved in installing Python on your system, in case that
   is necessary. Fortunately, both SCons and Python are very easy to
   install on almost any system, and Python already comes installed on
   many systems.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.1. Installing Python

   Because SCons is written in Python, you must obviously have Python
   installed on your system to use SCons. Before you try to install
   Python, you should check to see if Python is already available on your
   system by typing python -V (capital 'V') or python --version at your
   system's command-line prompt.
       $ python -V
       Python 2.5.1

   And on a Windows system with Python installed:
       C:\>python -V
       Python 2.5.1

   If Python is not installed on your system, you will see an error
   message stating something like "command not found" (on UNIX or Linux)
   or "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
   operable progam or batch file" (on Windows). In that case, you need to
   install Python before you can install SCons.

   The standard location for information about downloading and installing
   Python is [212]http://www.python.org/download/. See that page for
   information about how to download and install Python on your system.

   SCons will work with any version of Python from 2.4 or later. If you
   need to install Python and have a choice, we recommend using the most
   recent Python version available. Newer Pythons have significant
   improvements that help speed up the performance of SCons.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.2. Installing SCons From Pre-Built Packages

   SCons comes pre-packaged for installation on a number of systems,
   including Linux and Windows systems. You do not need to read this
   entire section, you should need to read only the section appropriate to
   the type of system you're running on.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.2.1. Installing SCons on Red Hat (and Other RPM-based) Linux Systems

   SCons comes in RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) format, pre-built and
   ready to install on Red Hat Linux, Fedora, or any other Linux
   distribution that uses RPM. Your distribution may already have an SCons
   RPM built specifically for it; many do, including SUSE, Mandrake and
   Fedora. You can check for the availability of an SCons RPM on your
   distribution's download servers, or by consulting an RPM search site
   like [213]http://www.rpmfind.net/ or [214]http://rpm.pbone.net/.

   If your distribution supports installation via yum, you should be able
   to install SCons by running:
        # yum install scons

   If your Linux distribution does not already have a specific SCons RPM
   file, you can download and install from the generic RPM provided by the
   SCons project. This will install the SCons script(s) in /usr/bin, and
   the SCons library modules in /usr/lib/scons.

   To install from the command line, simply download the appropriate .rpm
   file, and then run:
        # rpm -Uvh scons-2.0.0.final.0-1.noarch.rpm

   Or, you can use a graphical RPM package manager. See your package
   manager application's documention for specific instructions about how
   to use it to install a downloaded RPM.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.2.2. Installing SCons on Debian Linux Systems

   Debian Linux systems use a different package management format that
   also makes it very easy to install SCons.

   If your system is connected to the Internet, you can install the latest
   official Debian package by running:
        # apt-get install scons
     __________________________________________________________________

1.2.3. Installing SCons on Windows Systems

   SCons provides a Windows installer that makes installation extremely
   easy. Download the scons-2.0.0.final.0.win32.exe file from the SCons
   download page at [215]http://www.scons.org/download.php. Then all you
   need to do is execute the file (usually by clicking on its icon in
   Windows Explorer). These will take you through a small sequence of
   windows that will install SCons on your system.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.3. Building and Installing SCons on Any System

   If a pre-built SCons package is not available for your system, then you
   can still easily build and install SCons using the native Python
   distutils package.

   The first step is to download either the scons-2.0.0.final.0.tar.gz or
   scons-2.0.0.final.0.zip, which are available from the SCons download
   page at [216]http://www.scons.org/download.html.

   Unpack the archive you downloaded, using a utility like tar on Linux or
   UNIX, or WinZip on Windows. This will create a directory called
   scons-2.0.0.final.0, usually in your local directory. Then change your
   working directory to that directory and install SCons by executing the
   following commands:
      # cd scons-2.0.0.final.0
      # python setup.py install

   This will build SCons, install the scons script in the python which is
   used to run the setup.py's scripts directory (/usr/local/bin or
   C:\Python25\Scripts), and will install the SCons build engine in the
   corresponding library directory for the python used
   (/usr/local/lib/scons or C:\Python25\scons). Because these are system
   directories, you may need root (on Linux or UNIX) or Administrator (on
   Windows) privileges to install SCons like this.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.3.1. Building and Installing Multiple Versions of SCons Side-by-Side

   The SCons setup.py script has some extensions that support easy
   installation of multiple versions of SCons in side-by-side locations.
   This makes it easier to download and experiment with different versions
   of SCons before moving your official build process to a new version,
   for example.

   To install SCons in a version-specific location, add the --version-lib
   option when you call setup.py:
        # python setup.py install --version-lib

   This will install the SCons build engine in the
   /usr/lib/scons-2.0.0.final.0 or C:\Python25\scons-2.0.0.final.0
   directory, for example.

   If you use the --version-lib option the first time you install SCons,
   you do not need to specify it each time you install a new version. The
   SCons setup.py script will detect the version-specific directory
   name(s) and assume you want to install all versions in version-specific
   directories. You can override that assumption in the future by
   explicitly specifying the --standalone-lib option.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.3.2. Installing SCons in Other Locations

   You can install SCons in locations other than the default by specifying
   the --prefix= option:
        # python setup.py install --prefix=/opt/scons

   This would install the scons script in /opt/scons/bin and the build
   engine in /opt/scons/lib/scons,

   Note that you can specify both the --prefix= and the --version-lib
   options at the same type, in which case setup.py will install the build
   engine in a version-specific directory relative to the specified
   prefix. Adding --version-lib to the above example would install the
   build engine in /opt/scons/lib/scons-2.0.0.final.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.3.3. Building and Installing SCons Without Administrative Privileges

   If you don't have the right privileges to install SCons in a system
   location, simply use the --prefix= option to install it in a location
   of your choosing. For example, to install SCons in appropriate
   locations relative to the user's $HOME directory, the scons script in
   $HOME/bin and the build engine in $HOME/lib/scons, simply type:
        $ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

   You may, of course, specify any other location you prefer, and may use
   the --version-lib option if you would like to install version-specific
   directories relative to the specified prefix.

   This can also be used to experiment with a newer version of SCons than
   the one installed in your system locations. Of course, the location in
   which you install the newer version of the scons script ($HOME/bin in
   the above example) must be configured in your PATH variable before the
   directory containing the system-installed version of the scons script.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Simple Builds

   In this chapter, you will see several examples of very simple build
   configurations using SCons, which will demonstrate how easy it is to
   use SCons to build programs from several different programming
   languages on different types of systems.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.1. Building Simple C / C++ Programs

   Here's the famous "Hello, World!" program in C:
      int
      main()
      {
          printf("Hello, world!\n");
      }

   And here's how to build it using SCons. Enter the following into a file
   named SConstruct:
      Program('hello.c')

   This minimal configuration file gives SCons two pieces of information:
   what you want to build (an executable program), and the input file from
   which you want it built (the hello.c file). [217]Program is a
   builder_method, a Python call that tells SCons that you want to build
   an executable program.

   That's it. Now run the scons command to build the program. On a
   POSIX-compliant system like Linux or UNIX, you'll see something like:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      scons: done building targets.

   On a Windows system with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, you'll see
   something like:
      C:\>scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
      link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
      scons: done building targets.

   First, notice that you only need to specify the name of the source
   file, and that SCons correctly deduces the names of the object and
   executable files to be built from the base of the source file name.

   Second, notice that the same input SConstruct file, without any
   changes, generates the correct output file names on both systems:
   hello.o and hello on POSIX systems, hello.obj and hello.exe on Windows
   systems. This is a simple example of how SCons makes it extremely easy
   to write portable software builds.

   (Note that we won't provide duplicate side-by-side POSIX and Windows
   output for all of the examples in this guide; just keep in mind that,
   unless otherwise specified, any of the examples should work equally
   well on both types of systems.)
     __________________________________________________________________

2.2. Building Object Files

   The [218]Program builder method is only one of many builder methods
   that SCons provides to build different types of files. Another is the
   [219]Object builder method, which tells SCons to build an object file
   from the specified source file:
      Object('hello.c')

   Now when you run the scons command to build the program, it will build
   just the hello.o object file on a POSIX system:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      scons: done building targets.

   And just the hello.obj object file on a Windows system (with the
   Microsoft Visual C++ compiler):
      C:\>scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
      scons: done building targets.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.3. Simple Java Builds

   SCons also makes building with Java extremely easy. Unlike the
   [220]Program and [221]Object builder methods, however, the [222]Java
   builder method requires that you specify the name of a destination
   directory in which you want the class files placed, followed by the
   source directory in which the .java files live:
     Java('classes', 'src')

   If the src directory contains a single hello.java file, then the output
   from running the scons command would look something like this (on a
   POSIX system):
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/hello.java
      scons: done building targets.

   We'll cover Java builds in more detail, including building Java archive
   (.jar) and other types of file, in [223]Chapter 27.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.4. Cleaning Up After a Build

   When using SCons, it is unnecessary to add special commands or target
   names to clean up after a build. Instead, you simply use the -c or
   --clean option when you invoke SCons, and SCons removes the appropriate
   built files. So if we build our example above and then invoke scons -c
   afterwards, the output on POSIX looks like:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      scons: done building targets.
      % scons -c
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Cleaning targets ...
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      scons: done cleaning targets.

   And the output on Windows looks like:
      C:\>scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
      link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
      scons: done building targets.
      C:\>scons -c
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Cleaning targets ...
      Removed hello.obj
      Removed hello.exe
      scons: done cleaning targets.

   Notice that SCons changes its output to tell you that it is Cleaning
   targets ... and done cleaning targets.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5. The SConstruct File

   If you're used to build systems like Make you've already figured out
   that the SConstruct file is the SCons equivalent of a Makefile. That
   is, the SConstruct file is the input file that SCons reads to control
   the build.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.1. SConstruct Files Are Python Scripts

   There is, however, an important difference between an SConstruct file
   and a Makefile: the SConstruct file is actually a Python script. If
   you're not already familiar with Python, don't worry. This User's Guide
   will introduce you step-by-step to the relatively small amount of
   Python you'll need to know to be able to use SCons effectively. And
   Python is very easy to learn.

   One aspect of using Python as the scripting language is that you can
   put comments in your SConstruct file using Python's commenting
   convention; that is, everything between a '#' and the end of the line
   will be ignored:
        # Arrange to build the "hello" program.
        Program('hello.c')    # "hello.c" is the source file.

   You'll see throughout the remainder of this Guide that being able to
   use the power of a real scripting language can greatly simplify the
   solutions to complex requirements of real-world builds.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.2. SCons Functions Are Order-Independent

   One important way in which the SConstruct file is not exactly like a
   normal Python script, and is more like a Makefile, is that the order in
   which the SCons functions are called in the SConstruct file does not
   affect the order in which SCons actually builds the programs and object
   files you want it to build.[224][1] In other words, when you call the
   [225]Program builder (or any other builder method), you're not telling
   SCons to build the program at the instant the builder method is called.
   Instead, you're telling SCons to build the program that you want, for
   example, a program built from a file named hello.c, and it's up to
   SCons to build that program (and any other files) whenever it's
   necessary. (We'll learn more about how SCons decides when building or
   rebuilding a file is necessary in [226]Chapter 6, below.)

   SCons reflects this distinction between calling a builder method like
   Program and actually building the program by printing the status
   messages that indicate when it's "just reading" the SConstruct file,
   and when it's actually building the target files. This is to make it
   clear when SCons is executing the Python statements that make up the
   SConstruct file, and when SCons is actually executing the commands or
   other actions to build the necessary files.

   Let's clarify this with an example. Python has a print statement that
   prints a string of characters to the screen. If we put print statements
   around our calls to the Program builder method:
       print "Calling Program('hello.c')"
       Program('hello.c')
       print "Calling Program('goodbye.c')"
       Program('goodbye.c')
       print "Finished calling Program()"

   Then when we execute SCons, we see the output from the print statements
   in between the messages about reading the SConscript files, indicating
   that that is when the Python statements are being executed:
       % scons
       scons: Reading SConscript files ...
       Calling Program('hello.c')
       Calling Program('goodbye.c')
       Finished calling Program()
       scons: done reading SConscript files.
       scons: Building targets ...
       cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
       cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       scons: done building targets.

   Notice also that SCons built the goodbye program first, even though the
   "reading SConscript" output shows that we called Program('hello.c')
   first in the SConstruct file.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.6. Making the SCons Output Less Verbose

   You've already seen how SCons prints some messages about what it's
   doing, surrounding the actual commands used to build the software:
      C:\>scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
      link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
      scons: done building targets.

   These messages emphasize the order in which SCons does its work: all of
   the configuration files (generically referred to as SConscript files)
   are read and executed first, and only then are the target files built.
   Among other benefits, these messages help to distinguish between errors
   that occur while the configuration files are read, and errors that
   occur while targets are being built.

   One drawback, of course, is that these messages clutter the output.
   Fortunately, they're easily disabled by using the -Q option when
   invoking SCons:
      C:\>scons -Q
      cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
      link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj

   Because we want this User's Guide to focus on what SCons is actually
   doing, we're going to use the -Q option to remove these messages from
   the output of all the remaining examples in this Guide.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Less Simple Things to Do With Builds

   In this chapter, you will see several examples of very simple build
   configurations using SCons, which will demonstrate how easy it is to
   use SCons to build programs from several different programming
   languages on different types of systems.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.1. Specifying the Name of the Target (Output) File

   You've seen that when you call the [227]Program builder method, it
   builds the resulting program with the same base name as the source
   file. That is, the following call to build an executable program from
   the hello.c source file will build an executable program named hello on
   POSIX systems, and an executable program named hello.exe on Windows
   systems:
       Program('hello.c')

   If you want to build a program with a different name than the base of
   the source file name, you simply put the target file name to the left
   of the source file name:
       Program('new_hello', 'hello.c')

   (SCons requires the target file name first, followed by the source file
   name, so that the order mimics that of an assignment statement in most
   programming languages, including Python: "program = source files".)

   Now SCons will build an executable program named new_hello when run on
   a POSIX system:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o new_hello hello.o

   And SCons will build an executable program named new_hello.exe when run
   on a Windows system:
       C:\>scons -Q
       cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
       link /nologo /OUT:new_hello.exe hello.obj
     __________________________________________________________________

3.2. Compiling Multiple Source Files

   You've just seen how to configure SCons to compile a program from a
   single source file. It's more common, of course, that you'll need to
   build a program from many input source files, not just one. To do this,
   you need to put the source files in a Python list (enclosed in square
   brackets), like so:
       Program(['prog.c', 'file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   A build of the above example would look like:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
       cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
       cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
       cc -o prog prog.o file1.o file2.o

   Notice that SCons deduces the output program name from the first source
   file specified in the list--that is, because the first source file was
   prog.c, SCons will name the resulting program prog (or prog.exe on a
   Windows system). If you want to specify a different program name, then
   (as we've seen in the previous section) you slide the list of source
   files over to the right to make room for the output program file name.
   (SCons puts the output file name to the left of the source file names
   so that the order mimics that of an assignment statement: "program =
   source files".) This makes our example:
       Program('program', ['prog.c', 'file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   On Linux, a build of this example would look like:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
       cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
       cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
       cc -o program prog.o file1.o file2.o

   Or on Windows:
       C:\>scons -Q
       cl /Fofile1.obj /c file1.c /nologo
       cl /Fofile2.obj /c file2.c /nologo
       cl /Foprog.obj /c prog.c /nologo
       link /nologo /OUT:program.exe prog.obj file1.obj file2.obj
     __________________________________________________________________

3.3. Making a list of files with Glob

   You can also use the Glob function to find all files matching a certain
   template, using the standard shell pattern matching characters *, ? and
   [abc] to match any of a, b or c. [!abc] is also supported, to match any
   character except a, b or c. This makes many multi-source-file builds
   quite easy:
       Program('program', Glob('*.c'))

   The SCons man page has more details on using Glob with variant
   directories (see [228]Chapter 18, below) and repositories (see
   [229]Chapter 23, below), and returning strings rather than Nodes.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.4. Specifying Single Files Vs. Lists of Files

   We've now shown you two ways to specify the source for a program, one
   with a list of files:
       Program('hello', ['file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   And one with a single file:
       Program('hello', 'hello.c')

   You could actually put a single file name in a list, too, which you
   might prefer just for the sake of consistency:
       Program('hello', ['hello.c'])

   SCons functions will accept a single file name in either form. In fact,
   internally, SCons treats all input as lists of files, but allows you to
   omit the square brackets to cut down a little on the typing when
   there's only a single file name.

Important

             Although SCons functions are forgiving about whether or not you use a
             string vs. a list for a single file name, Python itself is more strict
             about treating lists and strings differently. So where SCons allows
             either a string or list:
                 # The following two calls both work correctly:
                 Program('program1', 'program1.c')
                 Program('program2', ['program2.c'])

             Trying to do "Python things" that mix strings and lists will cause
             errors or lead to incorrect results:
                 common_sources = ['file1.c', 'file2.c']

                 # THE FOLLOWING IS INCORRECT AND GENERATES A PYTHON ERROR
                 # BECAUSE IT TRIES TO ADD A STRING TO A LIST:
                 Program('program1', common_sources + 'program1.c')

                 # The following works correctly, because it's adding two
                 # lists together to make another list.
                 Program('program2', common_sources + ['program2.c'])
     __________________________________________________________________

3.5. Making Lists of Files Easier to Read

   One drawback to the use of a Python list for source files is that each
   file name must be enclosed in quotes (either single quotes or double
   quotes). This can get cumbersome and difficult to read when the list of
   file names is long. Fortunately, SCons and Python provide a number of
   ways to make sure that the SConstruct file stays easy to read.

   To make long lists of file names easier to deal with, SCons provides a
   Split function that takes a quoted list of file names, with the names
   separated by spaces or other white-space characters, and turns it into
   a list of separate file names. Using the Split function turns the
   previous example into:
       Program('program', Split('main.c file1.c file2.c'))

   (If you're already familiar with Python, you'll have realized that this
   is similar to the split() method in the Python standard string module.
   Unlike the split() member function of strings, however, the Split
   function does not require a string as input and will wrap up a single
   non-string object in a list, or return its argument untouched if it's
   already a list. This comes in handy as a way to make sure arbitrary
   values can be passed to SCons functions without having to check the
   type of the variable by hand.)

   Putting the call to the Split function inside the Program call can also
   be a little unwieldy. A more readable alternative is to assign the
   output from the Split call to a variable name, and then use the
   variable when calling the Program function:
       src_files = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
       Program('program', src_files)

   Lastly, the Split function doesn't care how much white space separates
   the file names in the quoted string. This allows you to create lists of
   file names that span multiple lines, which often makes for easier
   editing:
       src_files = Split("""main.c
                            file1.c
                            file2.c""")
       Program('program', src_files)

   (Note in this example that we used the Python "triple-quote" syntax,
   which allows a string to contain multiple lines. The three quotes can
   be either single or double quotes.)
     __________________________________________________________________

3.6. Keyword Arguments

   SCons also allows you to identify the output file and input source
   files using Python keyword arguments. The output file is known as the
   target, and the source file(s) are known (logically enough) as the
   source. The Python syntax for this is:
       src_files = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
       Program(target = 'program', source = src_files)

   Because the keywords explicitly identify what each argument is, you can
   actually reverse the order if you prefer:
       src_files = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
       Program(source = src_files, target = 'program')

   Whether or not you choose to use keyword arguments to identify the
   target and source files, and the order in which you specify them when
   using keywords, are purely personal choices; SCons functions the same
   regardless.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7. Compiling Multiple Programs

   In order to compile multiple programs within the same SConstruct file,
   simply call the Program method multiple times, once for each program
   you need to build:
       Program('foo.c')
       Program('bar', ['bar1.c', 'bar2.c'])

   SCons would then build the programs as follows:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o bar1.o -c bar1.c
       cc -o bar2.o -c bar2.c
       cc -o bar bar1.o bar2.o
       cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
       cc -o foo foo.o

   Notice that SCons does not necessarily build the programs in the same
   order in which you specify them in the SConstruct file. SCons does,
   however, recognize that the individual object files must be built
   before the resulting program can be built. We'll discuss this in
   greater detail in the "Dependencies" section, below.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.8. Sharing Source Files Between Multiple Programs

   It's common to re-use code by sharing source files between multiple
   programs. One way to do this is to create a library from the common
   source files, which can then be linked into resulting programs.
   (Creating libraries is discussed in [230]Chapter 4, below.)

   A more straightforward, but perhaps less convenient, way to share
   source files between multiple programs is simply to include the common
   files in the lists of source files for each program:
       Program(Split('foo.c common1.c common2.c'))
       Program('bar', Split('bar1.c bar2.c common1.c common2.c'))

   SCons recognizes that the object files for the common1.c and common2.c
   source files each need to be built only once, even though the resulting
   object files are each linked in to both of the resulting executable
   programs:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o bar1.o -c bar1.c
       cc -o bar2.o -c bar2.c
       cc -o common1.o -c common1.c
       cc -o common2.o -c common2.c
       cc -o bar bar1.o bar2.o common1.o common2.o
       cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
       cc -o foo foo.o common1.o common2.o

   If two or more programs share a lot of common source files, repeating
   the common files in the list for each program can be a maintenance
   problem when you need to change the list of common files. You can
   simplify this by creating a separate Python list to hold the common
   file names, and concatenating it with other lists using the Python +
   operator:
       common = ['common1.c', 'common2.c']
       foo_files = ['foo.c'] + common
       bar_files = ['bar1.c', 'bar2.c'] + common
       Program('foo', foo_files)
       Program('bar', bar_files)

   This is functionally equivalent to the previous example.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Building and Linking with Libraries

   It's often useful to organize large software projects by collecting
   parts of the software into one or more libraries. SCons makes it easy
   to create libraries and to use them in the programs.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.1. Building Libraries

   You build your own libraries by specifying [231]Library instead of
   [232]Program:
      Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   SCons uses the appropriate library prefix and suffix for your system.
   So on POSIX or Linux systems, the above example would build as follows
   (although ranlib may not be called on all systems):
      % scons -Q
      cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
      ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
      ranlib libfoo.a

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:
      C:\>scons -Q
      cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo
      cl /Fof2.obj /c f2.c /nologo
      cl /Fof3.obj /c f3.c /nologo
      lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj

   The rules for the target name of the library are similar to those for
   programs: if you don't explicitly specify a target library name, SCons
   will deduce one from the name of the first source file specified, and
   SCons will add an appropriate file prefix and suffix if you leave them
   off.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.1.1. Building Libraries From Source Code or Object Files

   The previous example shows building a library from a list of source
   files. You can, however, also give the [233]Library call object files,
   and it will correctly realize In fact, you can arbitrarily mix source
   code files and object files in the source list:
        Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.o', 'f3.c', 'f4.o'])

   And SCons realizes that only the source code files must be compiled
   into object files before creating the final library:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
        cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
        ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o
        ranlib libfoo.a

   Of course, in this example, the object files must already exist for the
   build to succeed. See [234]Chapter 5, below, for information about how
   you can build object files explicitly and include the built files in a
   library.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.1.2. Building Static Libraries Explicitly: the StaticLibrary Builder

   The [235]Library function builds a traditional static library. If you
   want to be explicit about the type of library being built, you can use
   the synonym [236]StaticLibrary function instead of Library:
        StaticLibrary('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   There is no functional difference between the [237]StaticLibrary and
   Library functions.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.1.3. Building Shared (DLL) Libraries: the SharedLibrary Builder

   If you want to build a shared library (on POSIX systems) or a DLL file
   (on Windows systems), you use the [238]SharedLibrary function:
        SharedLibrary('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   The output on POSIX:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o f1.os -c f1.c
        cc -o f2.os -c f2.c
        cc -o f3.os -c f3.c
        cc -o libfoo.so -shared f1.os f2.os f3.os

   And the output on Windows:
        C:\>scons -Q
        cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo
        cl /Fof2.obj /c f2.c /nologo
        cl /Fof3.obj /c f3.c /nologo
        link /nologo /dll /out:foo.dll /implib:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
        RegServerFunc(target, source, env)

   Notice again that SCons takes care of building the output file
   correctly, adding the -shared option for a POSIX compilation, and the
   /dll option on Windows.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.2. Linking with Libraries

   Usually, you build a library because you want to link it with one or
   more programs. You link libraries with a program by specifying the
   libraries in the [239]$LIBS construction variable, and by specifying
   the directory in which the library will be found in the [240]$LIBPATH
   construction variable:
      Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
      Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo', 'bar'], LIBPATH='.')

   Notice, of course, that you don't need to specify a library prefix
   (like lib) or suffix (like .a or .lib). SCons uses the correct prefix
   or suffix for the current system.

   On a POSIX or Linux system, a build of the above example would look
   like:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
      ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
      ranlib libfoo.a
      cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
      cc -o prog prog.o -L. -lfoo -lbar

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:
      C:\>scons -Q
      cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo
      cl /Fof2.obj /c f2.c /nologo
      cl /Fof3.obj /c f3.c /nologo
      lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
      cl /Foprog.obj /c prog.c /nologo
      link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:. foo.lib bar.lib prog.obj

   As usual, notice that SCons has taken care of constructing the correct
   command lines to link with the specified library on each system.

   Note also that, if you only have a single library to link with, you can
   specify the library name in single string, instead of a Python list, so
   that:
      Program('prog.c', LIBS='foo', LIBPATH='.')

   is equivalent to:
      Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo'], LIBPATH='.')

   This is similar to the way that SCons handles either a string or a list
   to specify a single source file.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.3. Finding Libraries: the $LIBPATH Construction Variable

   By default, the linker will only look in certain system-defined
   directories for libraries. SCons knows how to look for libraries in
   directories that you specify with the [241]$LIBPATH construction
   variable. $LIBPATH consists of a list of directory names, like so:
      Program('prog.c', LIBS = 'm',
                        LIBPATH = ['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])

   Using a Python list is preferred because it's portable across systems.
   Alternatively, you could put all of the directory names in a single
   string, separated by the system-specific path separator character: a
   colon on POSIX systems:
      LIBPATH = '/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib'

   or a semi-colon on Windows systems:
      LIBPATH = 'C:\\lib;D:\\lib'

   (Note that Python requires that the backslash separators in a Windows
   path name be escaped within strings.)

   When the linker is executed, SCons will create appropriate flags so
   that the linker will look for libraries in the same directories as
   SCons. So on a POSIX or Linux system, a build of the above example
   would look like:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
      cc -o prog prog.o -L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lm

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:
      C:\>scons -Q
      cl /Foprog.obj /c prog.c /nologo
      link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:\usr\lib /LIBPATH:\usr\local\lib m.lib
 prog.obj

   Note again that SCons has taken care of the system-specific details of
   creating the right command-line options.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 5. Node Objects

   Internally, SCons represents all of the files and directories it knows
   about as Nodes. These internal objects (not object files) can be used
   in a variety of ways to make your SConscript files portable and easy to
   read.
     __________________________________________________________________

5.1. Builder Methods Return Lists of Target Nodes

   All builder methods return a list of Node objects that identify the
   target file or files that will be built. These returned Nodes can be
   passed as arguments to other builder methods.

   For example, suppose that we want to build the two object files that
   make up a program with different options. This would mean calling the
   [242]Object builder once for each object file, specifying the desired
   options:
    Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
    Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')

   One way to combine these object files into the resulting program would
   be to call the [243]Program builder with the names of the object files
   listed as sources:
    Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
    Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')
    Program(['hello.o', 'goodbye.o'])

   The problem with specifying the names as strings is that our SConstruct
   file is no longer portable across operating systems. It won't, for
   example, work on Windows because the object files there would be named
   hello.obj and goodbye.obj, not hello.o and goodbye.o.

   A better solution is to assign the lists of targets returned by the
   calls to the Object builder to variables, which we can then concatenate
   in our call to the Program builder:
      hello_list = Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
      goodbye_list = Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')
      Program(hello_list + goodbye_list)

   This makes our SConstruct file portable again, the build output on
   Linux looking like:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o goodbye.o -c -DGOODBYE goodbye.c
       cc -o hello.o -c -DHELLO hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o goodbye.o

   And on Windows:
       C:\>scons -Q
       cl /Fogoodbye.obj /c goodbye.c -DGOODBYE
       cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c -DHELLO
       link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj goodbye.obj

   We'll see examples of using the list of nodes returned by builder
   methods throughout the rest of this guide.
     __________________________________________________________________

5.2. Explicitly Creating File and Directory Nodes

   It's worth mentioning here that SCons maintains a clear distinction
   between Nodes that represent files and Nodes that represent
   directories. SCons supports File and Dir functions that, respectively,
   return a file or directory Node:
      hello_c = File('hello.c')
      Program(hello_c)

      classes = Dir('classes')
      Java(classes, 'src')

   Normally, you don't need to call File or Dir directly, because calling
   a builder method automatically treats strings as the names of files or
   directories, and translates them into the Node objects for you. The
   File and Dir functions can come in handy in situations where you need
   to explicitly instruct SCons about the type of Node being passed to a
   builder or other function, or unambiguously refer to a specific file in
   a directory tree.

   There are also times when you may need to refer to an entry in a file
   system without knowing in advance whether it's a file or a directory.
   For those situations, SCons also supports an Entry function, which
   returns a Node that can represent either a file or a directory.
    xyzzy = Entry('xyzzy')

   The returned xyzzy Node will be turned into a file or directory Node
   the first time it is used by a builder method or other function that
   requires one vs. the other.
     __________________________________________________________________

5.3. Printing Node File Names

   One of the most common things you can do with a Node is use it to print
   the file name that the node represents. Keep in mind, though, that
   because the object returned by a builder call is a list of Nodes, you
   must use Python subscripts to fetch individual Nodes from the list. For
   example, the following SConstruct file:
      hello_c = File('hello.c')
      Program(hello_c)

      classes = Dir('classes')
      Java(classes, 'src')

      object_list = Object('hello.c')
      program_list = Program(object_list)
      print "The object file is:", object_list[0]
      print "The program file is:", program_list[0]

   Would print the following file names on a POSIX system:
      % scons -Q
      The object file is: hello.o
      The program file is: hello
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   And the following file names on a Windows system:
      C:\>scons -Q
      The object file is: hello.obj
      The program file is: hello.exe
      cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
      link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj

   Note that in the above example, the object_list[0] extracts an actual
   Node object from the list, and the Python print statement converts the
   object to a string for printing.
     __________________________________________________________________

5.4. Using a Node's File Name as a String

   Printing a Node's name as described in the previous section works
   because the string representation of a Node object is the name of the
   file. If you want to do something other than print the name of the
   file, you can fetch it by using the builtin Python str function. For
   example, if you want to use the Python os.path.exists to figure out
   whether a file exists while the SConstruct file is being read and
   executed, you can fetch the string as follows:
      import os.path
      program_list = Program('hello.c')
      program_name = str(program_list[0])
      if not os.path.exists(program_name):
          print program_name, "does not exist!"

   Which executes as follows on a POSIX system:
      % scons -Q
      hello does not exist!
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

5.5. GetBuildPath: Getting the Path From a Node or String

   env.GetBuildPath(file_or_list) returns the path of a Node or a string
   representing a path. It can also take a list of Nodes and/or strings,
   and returns the list of paths. If passed a single Node, the result is
   the same as calling str(node) (see above). The string(s) can have
   embedded construction variables, which are expanded as usual, using the
   calling environment's set of variables. The paths can be files or
   directories, and do not have to exist.
      env=Environment(VAR="value")
      n=File("foo.c")
      print env.GetBuildPath([n, "sub/dir/$VAR"])

   Would print the following file names:
      % scons -Q
      ['foo.c', 'sub/dir/value']
      scons: `.' is up to date.

   There is also a function version of GetBuildPath which can be called
   without an Environment; that uses the default SCons Environment to do
   substitution on any string arguments.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Dependencies

   So far we've seen how SCons handles one-time builds. But one of the
   main functions of a build tool like SCons is to rebuild only what is
   necessary when source files change--or, put another way, SCons should
   not waste time rebuilding things that don't need to be rebuilt. You can
   see this at work simply by re-invoking SCons after building our simple
   hello example:
     % scons -Q
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     % scons -Q
     scons: `.' is up to date.

   The second time it is executed, SCons realizes that the hello program
   is up-to-date with respect to the current hello.c source file, and
   avoids rebuilding it. You can see this more clearly by naming the hello
   program explicitly on the command line:
     % scons -Q hello
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     % scons -Q hello
     scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Note that SCons reports "...is up to date" only for target files named
   explicitly on the command line, to avoid cluttering the output.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1. Deciding When an Input File Has Changed: the Decider Function

   Another aspect of avoiding unnecessary rebuilds is the fundamental
   build tool behavior of rebuilding things when an input file changes, so
   that the built software is up to date. By default, SCons keeps track of
   this through an MD5 signature, or checksum, of the contents of each
   file, although you can easily configure SCons to use the modification
   times (or time stamps) instead. You can even specify your own Python
   function for deciding if an input file has changed.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.1. Using MD5 Signatures to Decide if a File Has Changed

   By default, SCons keeps track of whether a file has changed based on an
   MD5 checksum of the file's contents, not the file's modification time.
   This means that you may be surprised by the default SCons behavior if
   you are used to the Make convention of forcing a rebuild by updating
   the file's modification time (using the touch command, for example):
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % touch hello.c
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Even though the file's modification time has changed, SCons realizes
   that the contents of the hello.c file have not changed, and therefore
   that the hello program need not be rebuilt. This avoids unnecessary
   rebuilds when, for example, someone rewrites the contents of a file
   without making a change. But if the contents of the file really do
   change, then SCons detects the change and rebuilds the program as
   required:
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % edit hello.c
             [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o

   Note that you can, if you wish, specify this default behavior (MD5
   signatures) explicitly using the Decider function as follows:
        Program('hello.c')
        Decider('MD5')

   You can also use the string 'content' as a synonym for 'MD5' when
   calling the Decider function.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.1.1. Ramifications of Using MD5 Signatures

   Using MD5 signatures to decide if an input file has changed has one
   surprising benefit: if a source file has been changed in such a way
   that the contents of the rebuilt target file(s) will be exactly the
   same as the last time the file was built, then any "downstream" target
   files that depend on the rebuilt-but-not-changed target file actually
   need not be rebuilt.

   So if, for example, a user were to only change a comment in a hello.c
   file, then the rebuilt hello.o file would be exactly the same as the
   one previously built (assuming the compiler doesn't put any
   build-specific information in the object file). SCons would then
   realize that it would not need to rebuild the hello program as follows:
           % scons -Q hello
           cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
           cc -o hello hello.o
           % edit hello.c
             [CHANGE A COMMENT IN hello.c]
           % scons -Q hello
           cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
           scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In essence, SCons "short-circuits" any dependent builds when it
   realizes that a target file has been rebuilt to exactly the same file
   as the last build. This does take some extra processing time to read
   the contents of the target (hello.o) file, but often saves time when
   the rebuild that was avoided would have been time-consuming and
   expensive.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.2. Using Time Stamps to Decide If a File Has Changed

   If you prefer, you can configure SCons to use the modification time of
   a file, not the file contents, when deciding if a target needs to be
   rebuilt. SCons gives you two ways to use time stamps to decide if an
   input file has changed since the last time a target has been built.

   The most familiar way to use time stamps is the way Make does: that is,
   have SCons decide that a target must be rebuilt if a source file's
   modification time is newer than the target file. To do this, call the
   Decider function as follows:
        Object('hello.c')
        Decider('timestamp-newer')

   This makes SCons act like Make when a file's modification time is
   updated (using the touch command, for example):
         % scons -Q hello.o
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         % touch hello.c
         % scons -Q hello.o
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c

   And, in fact, because this behavior is the same as the behavior of
   Make, you can also use the string 'make' as a synonym for
   'timestamp-newer' when calling the Decider function:
        Object('hello.c')
        Decider('make')

   One drawback to using times stamps exactly like Make is that if an
   input file's modification time suddenly becomes older than a target
   file, the target file will not be rebuilt. This can happen if an old
   copy of a source file is restored from a backup archive, for example.
   The contents of the restored file will likely be different than they
   were the last time a dependent target was built, but the target won't
   be rebuilt because the modification time of the source file is not
   newer than the target.

   Because SCons actually stores information about the source files' time
   stamps whenever a target is built, it can handle this situation by
   checking for an exact match of the source file time stamp, instead of
   just whether or not the source file is newer than the target file. To
   do this, specify the argument 'timestamp-match' when calling the
   Decider function:
        Object('hello.c')
        Decider('timestamp-match')

   When configured this way, SCons will rebuild a target whenever a source
   file's modification time has changed. So if we use the touch -t option
   to change the modification time of hello.c to an old date (January 1,
   1989), SCons will still rebuild the target file:
         % scons -Q hello.o
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         % touch -t 198901010000 hello.c
         % scons -Q hello.o
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c

   In general, the only reason to prefer timestamp-newer instead of
   timestamp-match, would be if you have some specific reason to require
   this Make-like behavior of not rebuilding a target when an
   otherwise-modified source file is older.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.3. Deciding If a File Has Changed Using Both MD Signatures and Time
Stamps

   As a performance enhancement, SCons provides a way to use MD5 checksums
   of file contents but to read those contents only when the file's
   timestamp has changed. To do this, call the Decider function with
   'MD5-timestamp' argument as follows:
        Program('hello.c')
        Decider('MD5-timestamp')

   So configured, SCons will still behave like it does when using
   Decider('MD5'):
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % touch hello.c
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.
         % edit hello.c
             [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
         % scons -Q hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o

   However, the second call to SCons in the above output, when the build
   is up-to-date, will have been performed by simply looking at the
   modification time of the hello.c file, not by opening it and performing
   an MD5 checksum calcuation on its contents. This can significantly
   speed up many up-to-date builds.

   The only drawback to using Decider('MD5-timestamp') is that SCons will
   not rebuild a target file if a source file was modified within one
   second of the last time SCons built the file. While most developers are
   programming, this isn't a problem in practice, since it's unlikely that
   someone will have built and then thought quickly enough to make a
   substantive change to a source file within one second. Certain build
   scripts or continuous integration tools may, however, rely on the
   ability to apply changes to files automatically and then rebuild as
   quickly as possible, in which case use of Decider('MD5-timestamp') may
   not be appropriate.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.4. Writing Your Own Custom Decider Function

   The different string values that we've passed to the Decider function
   are essentially used by SCons to pick one of several specific internal
   functions that implement various ways of deciding if a dependency
   (usually a source file) has changed since a target file has been built.
   As it turns out, you can also supply your own function to decide if a
   dependency has changed.

   For example, suppose we have an input file that contains a lot of data,
   in some specific regular format, that is used to rebuild a lot of
   different target files, but each target file really only depends on one
   particular section of the input file. We'd like to have each target
   file depend on only its section of the input file. However, since the
   input file may contain a lot of data, we want to open the input file
   only if its timestamp has changed. This could done with a custom
   Decider function that might look something like this:
        Program('hello.c')
        def decide_if_changed(dependency, target, prev_ni):
            if self.get_timestamp() != prev_ni.timestamp:
                dep = str(dependency)
                tgt = str(target)
                if specific_part_of_file_has_changed(dep, tgt):
                    return True
            return False
        Decider(decide_if_changed)

   Note that in the function definition, the dependency (input file) is
   the first argument, and then the target. Both of these are passed to
   the functions as SCons Node objects, which we convert to strings using
   the Python str().

   The third argument, prev_ni, is an object that holds the signature or
   timestamp information that was recorded about the dependency the last
   time the target was built. A prev_ni object can hold different
   information, depending on the type of thing that the dependency
   argument represents. For normal files, the prev_ni object has the
   following attributes:

   .csig
          The content signature, or MD5 checksum, of the contents of the
          dependency file the list time the target was built.

   .size
          The size in bytes of the dependency file the list time the
          target was built.

   .timestamp
          The modification time of the dependency file the list time the
          target was built.

   Note that ignoring some of the arguments in your custom Decider
   function is a perfectly normal thing to do, if they don't impact the
   way you want to decide if the dependency file has changed.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.5. Mixing Different Ways of Deciding If a File Has Changed

   The previous examples have all demonstrated calling the global Decider
   function to configure all dependency decisions that SCons makes.
   Sometimes, however, you want to be able to configure different
   decision-making for different targets. When that's necessary, you can
   use the env.Decider method to affect only the configuration decisions
   for targets built with a specific construction environment.

   For example, if we arbitrarily want to build one program using MD5
   checkums and another using file modification times from the same source
   we might configure it this way:
        env1 = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
        env2 = env1.Clone()
        env2.Decider('timestamp-match')
        env1.Program('prog-MD5', 'program1.c')
        env2.Program('prog-timestamp', 'program2.c')

   If both of the programs include the same inc.h file, then updating the
   modification time of inc.h (using the touch command) will cause only
   prog-timestamp to be rebuilt:
         % scons -Q
         cc -o program1.o -c -I. program1.c
         cc -o prog-MD5 program1.o
         cc -o program2.o -c -I. program2.c
         cc -o prog-timestamp program2.o
         % touch inc.h
         % scons -Q
         cc -o program2.o -c -I. program2.c
         cc -o prog-timestamp program2.o
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2. Older Functions for Deciding When an Input File Has Changed

   SCons still supports two functions that used to be the primary methods
   for configuring the decision about whether or not an input file has
   changed. These functions have been officially deprecated as SCons
   version 2.0, and their use is discouraged, mainly because they rely on
   a somewhat confusing distinction between how source files and target
   files are handled. These functions are documented here mainly in case
   you encounter them in older SConscript files.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2.1. The SourceSignatures Function

   The SourceSignatures function is fairly straightforward, and supports
   two different argument values to configure whether source file changes
   should be decided using MD5 signatures:
        Program('hello.c')
        SourceSignatures('MD5')

   Or using time stamps:
        Program('hello.c')
        SourceSignatures('timestamp')

   These are roughly equivalent to specifying Decider('MD5') or
   Decider('timestamp-match'), respectively, although it only affects how
   SCons makes decisions about dependencies on source files--that is,
   files that are not built from any other files.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2.2. The TargetSignatures Function

   The TargetSignatures function specifies how SCons decides when a target
   file has changed when it is used as a dependency of (input to) another
   target--that is, the TargetSignatures function configures how the
   signatures of "intermediate" target files are used when deciding if a
   "downstream" target file must be rebuilt. [244][2]

   The TargetSignatures function supports the same 'MD5' and 'timestamp'
   argument values that are supported by the SourceSignatures, with the
   same meanings, but applied to target files. That is, in the example:
        Program('hello.c')
        TargetSignatures('MD5')

   The MD5 checksum of the hello.o target file will be used to decide if
   it has changed since the last time the "downstream" hello target file
   was built. And in the example:
        Program('hello.c')
        TargetSignatures('timestamp')

   The modification time of the hello.o target file will be used to decide
   if it has changed since the last time the "downstream" hello target
   file was built.

   The TargetSignatures function supports two additional argument values:
   'source' and 'build'. The 'source' argument specifies that decisions
   involving whether target files have changed since a previous build
   should use the same behavior for the decisions configured for source
   files (using the SourceSignatures function). So in the example:
        Program('hello.c')
        TargetSignatures('source')
        SourceSignatures('timestamp')

   All files, both targets and sources, will use modification times when
   deciding if an input file has changed since the last time a target was
   built.

   Lastly, the 'build' argument specifies that SCons should examine the
   build status of a target file and always rebuild a "downstream" target
   if the target file was itself rebuilt, without re-examining the
   contents or timestamp of the newly-built target file. If the target
   file was not rebuilt during this scons invocation, then the target file
   will be examined the same way as configured by the SourceSignature call
   to decide if it has changed.

   This mimics the behavior of build signatures in earlier versions of
   SCons. A build signature re-combined signatures of all the input files
   that went into making the target file, so that the target file itself
   did not need to have its contents read to compute an MD5 signature.
   This can improve performance for some configurations, but is generally
   not as effective as using Decider('MD5-timestamp').
     __________________________________________________________________

6.3. Implicit Dependencies: The $CPPPATH Construction Variable

   Now suppose that our "Hello, World!" program actually has an #include
   line to include the hello.h file in the compilation:
       #include <hello.h>
       int
       main()
       {
           printf("Hello, %s!\n", string);
       }

   And, for completeness, the hello.h file looks like this:
       #define string    "world"

   In this case, we want SCons to recognize that, if the contents of the
   hello.h file change, the hello program must be recompiled. To do this,
   we need to modify the SConstruct file like so:
       Program('hello.c', CPPPATH = '.')

   The [245]$CPPPATH value tells SCons to look in the current directory
   ('.') for any files included by C source files (.c or .h files). With
   this assignment in the SConstruct file:
       % scons -Q hello
       cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       % scons -Q hello
       scons: `hello' is up to date.
       % edit hello.h
           [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
       % scons -Q hello
       cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o

   First, notice that SCons added the -I. argument from the $CPPPATH
   variable so that the compilation would find the hello.h file in the
   local directory.

   Second, realize that SCons knows that the hello program must be rebuilt
   because it scans the contents of the hello.c file for the #include
   lines that indicate another file is being included in the compilation.
   SCons records these as implicit dependencies of the target file,
   Consequently, when the hello.h file changes, SCons realizes that the
   hello.c file includes it, and rebuilds the resulting hello program that
   depends on both the hello.c and hello.h files.

   Like the [246]$LIBPATH variable, the $CPPPATH variable may be a list of
   directories, or a string separated by the system-specific path
   separation character (':' on POSIX/Linux, ';' on Windows). Either way,
   SCons creates the right command-line options so that the following
   example:
       Program('hello.c', CPPPATH = ['include', '/home/project/inc'])

   Will look like this on POSIX or Linux:
       % scons -Q hello
       cc -o hello.o -c -Iinclude -I/home/project/inc hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o

   And like this on Windows:
       C:\>scons -Q hello.exe
       cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo /Iinclude /I\home\project\inc
       link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
     __________________________________________________________________

6.4. Caching Implicit Dependencies

   Scanning each file for #include lines does take some extra processing
   time. When you're doing a full build of a large system, the scanning
   time is usually a very small percentage of the overall time spent on
   the build. You're most likely to notice the scanning time, however,
   when you rebuild all or part of a large system: SCons will likely take
   some extra time to "think about" what must be built before it issues
   the first build command (or decides that everything is up to date and
   nothing must be rebuilt).

   In practice, having SCons scan files saves time relative to the amount
   of potential time lost to tracking down subtle problems introduced by
   incorrect dependencies. Nevertheless, the "waiting time" while SCons
   scans files can annoy individual developers waiting for their builds to
   finish. Consequently, SCons lets you cache the implicit dependencies
   that its scanners find, for use by later builds. You can do this by
   specifying the --implicit-cache option on the command line:
       % scons -Q --implicit-cache hello
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       % scons -Q hello
       scons: `hello' is up to date.

   If you don't want to specify --implicit-cache on the command line each
   time, you can make it the default behavior for your build by setting
   the implicit_cache option in an SConscript file:
       SetOption('implicit_cache', 1)

   SCons does not cache implicit dependencies like this by default because
   the --implicit-cache causes SCons to simply use the implicit
   dependencies stored during the last run, without any checking for
   whether or not those dependencies are still correct. Specifically, this
   means --implicit-cache instructs SCons to not rebuild "correctly" in
   the following cases:

     * When --implicit-cache is used, SCons will ignore any changes that
       may have been made to search paths (like $CPPPATH or $LIBPATH,).
       This can lead to SCons not rebuilding a file if a change to
       $CPPPATH would normally cause a different, same-named file from a
       different directory to be used.
     * When --implicit-cache is used, SCons will not detect if a
       same-named file has been added to a directory that is earlier in
       the search path than the directory in which the file was found last
       time.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.4.1. The --implicit-deps-changed Option

   When using cached implicit dependencies, sometimes you want to "start
   fresh" and have SCons re-scan the files for which it previously cached
   the dependencies. For example, if you have recently installed a new
   version of external code that you use for compilation, the external
   header files will have changed and the previously-cached implicit
   dependencies will be out of date. You can update them by running SCons
   with the --implicit-deps-changed option:
         % scons -Q --implicit-deps-changed hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In this case, SCons will re-scan all of the implicit dependencies and
   cache updated copies of the information.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.4.2. The --implicit-deps-unchanged Option

   By default when caching dependencies, SCons notices when a file has
   been modified and re-scans the file for any updated implicit dependency
   information. Sometimes, however, you may want to force SCons to use the
   cached implicit dependencies, even if the source files changed. This
   can speed up a build for example, when you have changed your source
   files but know that you haven't changed any #include lines. In this
   case, you can use the --implicit-deps-unchanged option:
         % scons -Q --implicit-deps-unchanged hello
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q hello
         scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In this case, SCons will assume that the cached implicit dependencies
   are correct and will not bother to re-scan changed files. For typical
   builds after small, incremental changes to source files, the savings
   may not be very big, but sometimes every bit of improved performance
   counts.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.5. Explicit Dependencies: the Depends Function

   Sometimes a file depends on another file that is not detected by an
   SCons scanner. For this situation, SCons allows you to specific
   explicitly that one file depends on another file, and must be rebuilt
   whenever that file changes. This is specified using the Depends method:
       hello = Program('hello.c')
       Depends(hello, 'other_file')

       % scons -Q hello
       cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
       cc -o hello hello.o
       % scons -Q hello
       scons: `hello' is up to date.
       % edit other_file
           [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF other_file]
       % scons -Q hello
       cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
       cc -o hello hello.o

   Note that the dependency (the second argument to Depends) may also be a
   list of Node objects (for example, as returned by a call to a Builder):
       hello = Program('hello.c')
       goodbye = Program('goodbye.c')
       Depends(hello, goodbye)

   in which case the dependency or dependencies will be built before the
   target(s):
       % scons -Q hello
       cc -c goodbye.c -o goodbye.o
       cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
       cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
       cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

6.6. Dependencies From External Files: the ParseDepends Function

   SCons has built-in scanners for a number of languages. Sometimes these
   scanners fail to extract certain implicit dependencies due to
   limitations of the scanner implementation.

   The following example illustrates a case where the built-in C scanner
   is unable to extract the implicit dependency on a header file.
      #define FOO_HEADER <foo.h>
      #include FOO_HEADER

      int main() {
          return FOO;
      }

      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % edit foo.h
         [CHANGE CONTENTS OF foo.h]
      % scons -Q
      scons: `.' is up to date.

   Apparently, the scanner does not know about the header dependency.
   Being not a full-fledged C preprocessor, the scanner does not expand
   the macro.

   In these cases, you may also use the compiler to extract the implicit
   dependencies. ParseDepends can parse the contents of the compiler
   output in the style of Make, and explicitly establish all of the listed
   dependencies.

   The following example uses ParseDepends to process a compiler generated
   dependency file which is generated as a side effect during compilation
   of the object file:
      obj = Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-MD -MF hello.d', CPPPATH='.')
      SideEffect('hello.d', obj)
      ParseDepends('hello.d')
      Program('hello', obj)

      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % edit foo.h
         [CHANGE CONTENTS OF foo.h]
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c

   Parsing dependencies from a compiler-generated .d file has a
   chicken-and-egg problem, that causes unnecessary rebuilds:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q --debug=explain
      scons: rebuilding `hello.o' because `foo.h' is a new dependency
      cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c
      % scons -Q
      scons: `.' is up to date.

   In the first pass, the dependency file is generated while the object
   file is compiled. At that time, SCons does not know about the
   dependency on foo.h. In the second pass, the object file is regenerated
   because foo.h is detected as a new dependency.

   ParseDepends immediately reads the specified file at invocation time
   and just returns if the file does not exist. A dependency file
   generated during the build process is not automatically parsed again.
   Hence, the compiler-extracted dependencies are not stored in the
   signature database during the same build pass. This limitation of
   ParseDepends leads to unnecessary recompilations. Therefore,
   ParseDepends should only be used if scanners are not available for the
   employed language or not powerful enough for the specific task.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.7. Ignoring Dependencies: the Ignore Function

   Sometimes it makes sense to not rebuild a program, even if a dependency
   file changes. In this case, you would tell SCons specifically to ignore
   a dependency as follows:
      hello_obj=Object('hello.c')
      hello = Program(hello_obj)
      Ignore(hello_obj, 'hello.h')

      % scons -Q hello
      cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q hello
      scons: `hello' is up to date.
      % edit hello.h
        [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
      % scons -Q hello
      scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Now, the above example is a little contrived, because it's hard to
   imagine a real-world situation where you wouldn't want to rebuild hello
   if the hello.h file changed. A more realistic example might be if the
   hello program is being built in a directory that is shared between
   multiple systems that have different copies of the stdio.h include
   file. In that case, SCons would notice the differences between the
   different systems' copies of stdio.h and would rebuild hello each time
   you change systems. You could avoid these rebuilds as follows:
       hello = Program('hello.c', CPPPATH=['/usr/include'])
       Ignore(hello, '/usr/include/stdio.h')

   Ignore can also be used to prevent a generated file from being built by
   default. This is due to the fact that directories depend on their
   contents. So to ignore a generated file from the default build, you
   specify that the directory should ignore the generated file. Note that
   the file will still be built if the user specifically requests the
   target on scons command line, or if the file is a dependency of another
   file which is requested and/or is built by default.
      hello_obj=Object('hello.c')
      hello = Program(hello_obj)
      Ignore('.',[hello,hello_obj])

      % scons -Q
      scons: `.' is up to date.
      % scons -Q hello
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q hello
      scons: `hello' is up to date.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.8. Order-Only Dependencies: the Requires Function

   Occasionally, it may be useful to specify that a certain file or
   directory must, if necessary, be built or created before some other
   target is built, but that changes to that file or directory do not
   require that the target itself be rebuilt. Such a relationship is
   called an order-only dependency because it only affects the order in
   which things must be built--the dependency before the target--but it is
   not a strict dependency relationship because the target should not
   change in response to changes in the dependent file.

   For example, suppose that you want to create a file every time you run
   a build that identifies the time the build was performed, the version
   number, etc., and which is included in every program that you build.
   The version file's contents will change every build. If you specify a
   normal dependency relationship, then every program that depends on that
   file would be rebuilt every time you ran SCons. For example, we could
   use some Python code in a SConstruct file to create a new version.c
   file with a string containing the current date every time we run SCons,
   and then link a program with the resulting object file by listing
   version.c in the sources:
      import time

      version_c_text = """
      char *date = "%s";
      """ % time.ctime(time.time())
      open('version.c', 'w').write(version_c_text)

      hello = Program(['hello.c', 'version.c'])

   If we list version.c as an actual source file, though, then the
   version.o file will get rebuilt every time we run SCons (because the
   SConstruct file itself changes the contents of version.c) and the hello
   executable will get re-linked every time (because the version.o file
   changes):
      % scons -Q hello
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o version.o -c version.c
      cc -o hello hello.o version.o
      % sleep 1
      % scons -Q hello
      cc -o version.o -c version.c
      cc -o hello hello.o version.o
      % sleep 1
      % scons -Q hello
      cc -o version.o -c version.c
      cc -o hello hello.o version.o

   (Note that for the above example to work, we sleep for one second in
   between each run, so that the SConstruct file will create a version.c
   file with a time string that's one second later than the previous run.)

   One solution is to use the Requires function to specify that the
   version.o must be rebuilt before it is used by the link step, but that
   changes to version.o should not actually cause the hello executable to
   be re-linked:
      import time

      version_c_text = """
      char *date = "%s";
      """ % time.ctime(time.time())
      open('version.c', 'w').write(version_c_text)

      version_obj = Object('version.c')

      hello = Program('hello.c',
                      LINKFLAGS = str(version_obj[0]))

      Requires(hello, version_obj)

   Notice that because we can no longer list version.c as one of the
   sources for the hello program, we have to find some other way to get it
   into the link command line. For this example, we're cheating a bit and
   stuffing the object file name (extracted from version_obj list returned
   by the Object call) into the [247]$LINKFLAGS variable, because
   $LINKFLAGS is already included in the [248]$LINKCOM command line.

   With these changes, we get the desired behavior of only re-linking the
   hello executable when the hello.c has changed, even though the
   version.o is rebuilt (because the SConstruct file still changes the
   version.c contents directly each run):
      % scons -Q hello
      cc -o version.o -c version.c
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello version.o hello.o
      % sleep 1
      % scons -Q hello
      cc -o version.o -c version.c
      scons: `hello' is up to date.
      % sleep 1
      % edit hello.c
          [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
      % scons -Q hello
      cc -o version.o -c version.c
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello version.o hello.o
      % sleep 1
      % scons -Q hello
      cc -o version.o -c version.c
      scons: `hello' is up to date.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.9. The AlwaysBuild Function

   How SCons handles dependencies can also be affected by the AlwaysBuild
   method. When a file is passed to the AlwaysBuild method, like so:
      hello = Program('hello.c')
      AlwaysBuild(hello)

   Then the specified target file (hello in our example) will always be
   considered out-of-date and rebuilt whenever that target file is
   evaluated while walking the dependency graph:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello hello.o

   The AlwaysBuild function has a somewhat misleading name, because it
   does not actually mean the target file will be rebuilt every single
   time SCons is invoked. Instead, it means that the target will, in fact,
   be rebuilt whenever the target file is encountered while evaluating the
   targets specified on the command line (and their dependencies). So
   specifying some other target on the command line, a target that does
   not itself depend on the AlwaysBuild target, will still be rebuilt only
   if it's out-of-date with respect to its dependencies:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q hello.o
      scons: `hello.o' is up to date.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 7. Environments

   An environment is a collection of values that can affect how a program
   executes. SCons distinguishes between three different types of
   environments that can affect the behavior of SCons itself (subject to
   the configuration in the SConscript files), as well as the compilers
   and other tools it executes:

   External Environment
          The external environment is the set of variables in the user's
          environment at the time the user runs SCons. These variables are
          available within the SConscript files through the Python
          os.environ dictionary. See [249]Section 7.1, below.

   Construction Environment
          A construction environment is a distinct object creating within
          a SConscript file and and which contains values that affect how
          SCons decides what action to use to build a target, and even to
          define which targets should be built from which sources. One of
          the most powerful features of SCons is the ability to create
          multiple construction environments, including the ability to
          clone a new, customized construction environment from an
          existing construction environment. See [250]Section 7.2, below.

   Execution Environment
          An execution environment is the values that SCons sets when
          executing an external command (such as a compiler or linker) to
          build one or more targets. Note that this is not the same as the
          external environment (see above). See [251]Section 7.3, below.

   Unlike Make, SCons does not automatically copy or import values between
   different environments (with the exception of explicit clones of
   construction environments, which inherit values from their parent).
   This is a deliberate design choice to make sure that builds are, by
   default, repeatable regardless of the values in the user's external
   environment. This avoids a whole class of problems with builds where a
   developer's local build works because a custom variable setting causes
   a different compiler or build option to be used, but the checked-in
   change breaks the official build because it uses different environment
   variable settings.

   Note that the SConscript writer can easily arrange for variables to be
   copied or imported between environments, and this is often very useful
   (or even downright necessary) to make it easy for developers to
   customize the build in appropriate ways. The point is not that copying
   variables between different environments is evil and must always be
   avoided. Instead, it should be up to the implementer of the build
   system to make conscious choices about how and when to import a
   variable from one environment to another, making informed decisions
   about striking the right balance between making the build repeatable on
   the one hand and convenient to use on the other.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.1. Using Values From the External Environment

   The external environment variable settings that the user has in force
   when executing SCons are available through the normal Python os.environ
   dictionary. This means that you must add an import os statement to any
   SConscript file in which you want to use values from the user's
   external environment.
     import os

   More usefully, you can use the os.environ dictionary in your SConscript
   files to initialize construction environments with values from the
   user's external environment. See the next section, [252]Section 7.2,
   for information on how to do this.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2. Construction Environments

   It is rare that all of the software in a large, complicated system
   needs to be built the same way. For example, different source files may
   need different options enabled on the command line, or different
   executable programs need to be linked with different libraries. SCons
   accommodates these different build requirements by allowing you to
   create and configure multiple construction environments that control
   how the software is built. A construction environment is an object that
   has a number of associated construction variables, each with a name and
   a value. (A construction environment also has an attached set of
   Builder methods, about which we'll learn more later.)
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.1. Creating a Construction Environment: the Environment Function

   A construction environment is created by the Environment method:
         env = Environment()

   By default, SCons initializes every new construction environment with a
   set of construction variables based on the tools that it finds on your
   system, plus the default set of builder methods necessary for using
   those tools. The construction variables are initialized with values
   describing the C compiler, the Fortran compiler, the linker, etc., as
   well as the command lines to invoke them.

   When you initialize a construction environment you can set the values
   of the environment's construction variables to control how a program is
   built. For example:
     import os

         env = Environment(CC = 'gcc',
                           CCFLAGS = '-O2')

         env.Program('foo.c')

   The construction environment in this example is still initialized with
   the same default construction variable values, except that the user has
   explicitly specified use of the GNU C compiler gcc, and further
   specifies that the -O2 (optimization level two) flag should be used
   when compiling the object file. In other words, the explicit
   initializations of [253]$CC and [254]$CCFLAGS override the default
   values in the newly-created construction environment. So a run from
   this example would look like:
         % scons -Q
         gcc -o foo.o -c -O2 foo.c
         gcc -o foo foo.o
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.2. Fetching Values From a Construction Environment

   You can fetch individual construction variables using the normal syntax
   for accessing individual named items in a Python dictionary:
         env = Environment()
         print "CC is:", env['CC']

   This example SConstruct file doesn't build anything, but because it's
   actually a Python script, it will print the value of [255]$CC for us:
         % scons -Q
         CC is: cc
         scons: `.' is up to date.

   A construction environment, however, is actually an object with
   associated methods, etc. If you want to have direct access to only the
   dictionary of construction variables, you can fetch this using the
   Dictionary method:
         env = Environment(FOO = 'foo', BAR = 'bar')
         dict = env.Dictionary()
         for key in ['OBJSUFFIX', 'LIBSUFFIX', 'PROGSUFFIX']:
             print "key = %s, value = %s" % (key, dict[key])

   This SConstruct file will print the specified dictionary items for us
   on POSIX systems as follows:
         % scons -Q
         key = OBJSUFFIX, value = .o
         key = LIBSUFFIX, value = .a
         key = PROGSUFFIX, value =
         scons: `.' is up to date.

   And on Windows:
         C:\>scons -Q
         key = OBJSUFFIX, value = .obj
         key = LIBSUFFIX, value = .lib
         key = PROGSUFFIX, value = .exe
         scons: `.' is up to date.

   If you want to loop and print the values of all of the construction
   variables in a construction environment, the Python code to do that in
   sorted order might look something like:
         env = Environment()
         for item in sorted(env.Dictionary().items()):
             print "construction variable = '%s', value = '%s'" % item
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.3. Expanding Values From a Construction Environment: the subst Method

   Another way to get information from a construction environment. is to
   use the subst method on a string containing $ expansions of
   construction variable names. As a simple example, the example from the
   previous section that used env['CC'] to fetch the value of [256]$CC
   could also be written as:
        env = Environment()
        print "CC is:", env.subst('$CC')

   One advantage of using subst to expand strings is that construction
   variables in the result get re-expanded until there are no expansions
   left in the string. So a simple fetch of a value like [257]$CCCOM:
        env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DFOO')
        print "CCCOM is:", env['CCCOM']

   Will print the unexpanded value of $CCCOM, showing us the construction
   variables that still need to be expanded:
        % scons -Q
        CCCOM is: $CC $CCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPDEFFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARG
ET $SOURCES
        scons: `.' is up to date.

   Calling the subst method on $CCOM, however:
        env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DFOO')
        print "CCCOM is:", env.subst('$CCCOM')

   Will recursively expand all of the construction variables prefixed with
   $ (dollar signs), showing us the final output:
        % scons -Q
        CCCOM is: gcc -DFOO -c -o
        scons: `.' is up to date.

   Note that because we're not expanding this in the context of building
   something there are no target or source files for [258]$TARGET and
   [259]$SOURCES to expand.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.4. Handling Problems With Value Expansion

   If a problem occurs when expanding a construction variable, by default
   it is expanded to '' (a null string), and will not cause scons to fail.
          env = Environment()
          print "value is:", env.subst( '->$MISSING<-' )

          % scons -Q
          value is: -><-
          scons: `.' is up to date.

   This default behaviour can be changed using the AllowSubstExceptions
   function. When a problem occurs with a variable expansion it generates
   an exception, and the AllowSubstExceptions function controls which of
   these exceptions are actually fatal and which are allowed to occur
   safely. By default, NameError and IndexError are the two exceptions
   that are allowed to occur: so instead of causing scons to fail, these
   are caught, the variable expanded to '' and scons execution continues.
   To require that all construction variable names exist, and that indexes
   out of range are not allowed, call AllowSubstExceptions with no extra
   arguments.
          AllowSubstExceptions()
          env = Environment()
          print "value is:", env.subst( '->$MISSING<-' )

          % scons -Q
          value is:
          scons: *** NameError `MISSING' trying to evaluate `$MISSING'
          File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 3, in <module>

   This can also be used to allow other exceptions that might occur, most
   usefully with the ${...} construction variable syntax. For example,
   this would allow zero-division to occur in a variable expansion in
   addition to the default exceptions allowed
          AllowSubstExceptions(IndexError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError)
          env = Environment()
          print "value is:", env.subst( '->${1 / 0}<-' )

          % scons -Q
          value is: -><-
          scons: `.' is up to date.


   If AllowSubstExceptions is called multiple times, each call completely
   overwrites the previous list of allowed exceptions.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.5. Controlling the Default Construction Environment: the
DefaultEnvironment Function

   All of the Builder functions that we've introduced so far, like Program
   and Library, actually use a default construction environment that
   contains settings for the various compilers and other tools that SCons
   configures by default, or otherwise knows about and has discovered on
   your system. The goal of the default construction environment is to
   make many configurations to "just work" to build software using readily
   available tools with a minimum of configuration changes.

   You can, however, control the settings in the default contstruction
   environment by using the DefaultEnvironment function to initialize
   various settings:
      DefaultEnvironment(CC = '/usr/local/bin/gcc')


   When configured as above, all calls to the Program or Object Builder
   will build object files with the /usr/local/bin/gcc compiler.

   Note that the DefaultEnvironment function returns the initialized
   default construction environment object, which can then be manipulated
   like any other construction environment. So the following would be
   equivalent to the previous example, setting the $CC variable to
   /usr/local/bin/gcc but as a separate step after the default
   construction environment has been initialized:
      env = DefaultEnvironment()
      env['CC'] = '/usr/local/bin/gcc'


   One very common use of the DefaultEnvironment function is to speed up
   SCons initialization. As part of trying to make most default
   configurations "just work," SCons will actually search the local system
   for installed compilers and other utilities. This search can take time,
   especially on systems with slow or networked file systems. If you know
   which compiler(s) and/or other utilities you want to configure, you can
   control the search that SCons performs by specifying some specific tool
   modules with which to initialize the default construction environment:
      env = DefaultEnvironment(tools = ['gcc', 'gnulink'],
                               CC = '/usr/local/bin/gcc')


   So the above example would tell SCons to explicitly configure the
   default environment to use its normal GNU Compiler and GNU Linker
   settings (without having to search for them, or any other utilities for
   that matter), and specifically to use the compiler found at
   /usr/local/bin/gcc.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.6. Multiple Construction Environments

   The real advantage of construction environments is that you can create
   as many different construction environments as you need, each tailored
   to a different way to build some piece of software or other file. If,
   for example, we need to build one program with the -O2 flag and another
   with the -g (debug) flag, we would do this like so:
         opt = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
         dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')

         opt.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

         dbg.Program('bar', 'bar.c')

         % scons -Q
         cc -o bar.o -c -g bar.c
         cc -o bar bar.o
         cc -o foo.o -c -O2 foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o

   We can even use multiple construction environments to build multiple
   versions of a single program. If you do this by simply trying to use
   the [260]Program builder with both environments, though, like this:
         opt = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
         dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')

         opt.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

         dbg.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

   Then SCons generates the following error:
         % scons -Q

         scons: *** Two environments with different actions were specified for t
he same target: foo.o
         File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 6, in <module>

   This is because the two Program calls have each implicitly told SCons
   to generate an object file named foo.o, one with a [261]$CCFLAGS value
   of -O2 and one with a [262]$CCFLAGS value of -g. SCons can't just
   decide that one of them should take precedence over the other, so it
   generates the error. To avoid this problem, we must explicitly specify
   that each environment compile foo.c to a separately-named object file
   using the [263]Object builder, like so:
         opt = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
         dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')

         o = opt.Object('foo-opt', 'foo.c')
         opt.Program(o)

         d = dbg.Object('foo-dbg', 'foo.c')
         dbg.Program(d)

   Notice that each call to the Object builder returns a value, an
   internal SCons object that represents the object file that will be
   built. We then use that object as input to the Program builder. This
   avoids having to specify explicitly the object file name in multiple
   places, and makes for a compact, readable SConstruct file. Our SCons
   output then looks like:
         % scons -Q
         cc -o foo-dbg.o -c -g foo.c
         cc -o foo-dbg foo-dbg.o
         cc -o foo-opt.o -c -O2 foo.c
         cc -o foo-opt foo-opt.o
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.7. Making Copies of Construction Environments: the Clone Method

   Sometimes you want more than one construction environment to share the
   same values for one or more variables. Rather than always having to
   repeat all of the common variables when you create each construction
   environment, you can use the Clone method to create a copy of a
   construction environment.

   Like the Environment call that creates a construction environment, the
   Clone method takes construction variable assignments, which will
   override the values in the copied construction environment. For
   example, suppose we want to use gcc to create three versions of a
   program, one optimized, one debug, and one with neither. We could do
   this by creating a "base" construction environment that sets [264]$CC
   to gcc, and then creating two copies, one which sets [265]$CCFLAGS for
   optimization and the other which sets $CCFLAGS for debugging:
         env = Environment(CC = 'gcc')
         opt = env.Clone(CCFLAGS = '-O2')
         dbg = env.Clone(CCFLAGS = '-g')

         env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

         o = opt.Object('foo-opt', 'foo.c')
         opt.Program(o)

         d = dbg.Object('foo-dbg', 'foo.c')
         dbg.Program(d)

   Then our output would look like:
         % scons -Q
         gcc -o foo.o -c foo.c
         gcc -o foo foo.o
         gcc -o foo-dbg.o -c -g foo.c
         gcc -o foo-dbg foo-dbg.o
         gcc -o foo-opt.o -c -O2 foo.c
         gcc -o foo-opt foo-opt.o
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.8. Replacing Values: the Replace Method

   You can replace existing construction variable values using the Replace
   method:
         env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DDEFINE1')
         env.Replace(CCFLAGS = '-DDEFINE2')
         env.Program('foo.c')

   The replacing value (-DDEFINE2 in the above example) completely
   replaces the value in the construction environment:
         % scons -Q
         cc -o foo.o -c -DDEFINE2 foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o

   You can safely call Replace for construction variables that don't exist
   in the construction environment:
         env = Environment()
         env.Replace(NEW_VARIABLE = 'xyzzy')
         print "NEW_VARIABLE =", env['NEW_VARIABLE']

   In this case, the construction variable simply gets added to the
   construction environment:
         % scons -Q
         NEW_VARIABLE = xyzzy
         scons: `.' is up to date.

   Because the variables aren't expanded until the construction
   environment is actually used to build the targets, and because SCons
   function and method calls are order-independent, the last replacement
   "wins" and is used to build all targets, regardless of the order in
   which the calls to Replace() are interspersed with calls to builder
   methods:
         env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-DDEFINE1')
         print "CCFLAGS =", env['CCFLAGS']
         env.Program('foo.c')

         env.Replace(CCFLAGS = '-DDEFINE2')
         print "CCFLAGS =", env['CCFLAGS']
         env.Program('bar.c')

   The timing of when the replacement actually occurs relative to when the
   targets get built becomes apparent if we run scons without the -Q
   option:
         % scons
         scons: Reading SConscript files ...
         CCFLAGS = -DDEFINE1
         CCFLAGS = -DDEFINE2
         scons: done reading SConscript files.
         scons: Building targets ...
         cc -o bar.o -c -DDEFINE2 bar.c
         cc -o bar bar.o
         cc -o foo.o -c -DDEFINE2 foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o
         scons: done building targets.

   Because the replacement occurs while the SConscript files are being
   read, the [266]$CCFLAGS variable has already been set to -DDEFINE2 by
   the time the foo.o target is built, even though the call to the Replace
   method does not occur until later in the SConscript file.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.9. Setting Values Only If They're Not Already Defined: the SetDefault
Method

   Sometimes it's useful to be able to specify that a construction
   variable should be set to a value only if the construction environment
   does not already have that variable defined You can do this with the
   SetDefault method, which behaves similarly to the set_default method of
   Python dictionary objects:
      env.SetDefault(SPECIAL_FLAG = '-extra-option')

   This is especially useful when writing your own Tool modules to apply
   variables to construction environments.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.10. Appending to the End of Values: the Append Method

   You can append a value to an existing construction variable using the
   Append method:
         env = Environment(CCFLAGS = ['-DMY_VALUE'])
         env.Append(CCFLAGS = ['-DLAST'])
         env.Program('foo.c')

   SCons then supplies both the -DMY_VALUE and -DLAST flags when compiling
   the object file:
         % scons -Q
         cc -o foo.o -c -DMY_VALUE -DLAST foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o

   If the construction variable doesn't already exist, the Append method
   will create it:
         env = Environment()
         env.Append(NEW_VARIABLE = 'added')
         print "NEW_VARIABLE =", env['NEW_VARIABLE']

   Which yields:
         % scons -Q
         NEW_VARIABLE = added
         scons: `.' is up to date.

   Note that the Append function tries to be "smart" about how the new
   value is appended to the old value. If both are strings, the previous
   and new strings are simply concatenated. Similarly, if both are lists,
   the lists are concatenated. If, however, one is a string and the other
   is a list, the string is added as a new element to the list.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.11. Appending Unique Values: the AppendUnique Method

   Some times it's useful to add a new value only if the existing
   construction variable doesn't already contain the value. This can be
   done using the AppendUnique method:
      env.AppendUnique(CCFLAGS=['-g'])

   In the above example, the -g would be added only if the $CCFLAGS
   variable does not already contain a -g value.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.12. Appending to the Beginning of Values: the Prepend Method

   You can append a value to the beginning of an existing construction
   variable using the Prepend method:
         env = Environment(CCFLAGS = ['-DMY_VALUE'])
         env.Prepend(CCFLAGS = ['-DFIRST'])
         env.Program('foo.c')

   SCons then supplies both the -DFIRST and -DMY_VALUE flags when
   compiling the object file:
         % scons -Q
         cc -o foo.o -c -DFIRST -DMY_VALUE foo.c
         cc -o foo foo.o

   If the construction variable doesn't already exist, the Prepend method
   will create it:
         env = Environment()
         env.Prepend(NEW_VARIABLE = 'added')
         print "NEW_VARIABLE =", env['NEW_VARIABLE']

   Which yields:
         % scons -Q
         NEW_VARIABLE = added
         scons: `.' is up to date.

   Like the Append function, the Prepend function tries to be "smart"
   about how the new value is appended to the old value. If both are
   strings, the previous and new strings are simply concatenated.
   Similarly, if both are lists, the lists are concatenated. If, however,
   one is a string and the other is a list, the string is added as a new
   element to the list.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.2.13. Prepending Unique Values: the PrependUnique Method

   Some times it's useful to add a new value to the beginning of a
   construction variable only if the existing value doesn't already
   contain the to-be-added value. This can be done using the PrependUnique
   method:
      env.PrependUnique(CCFLAGS=['-g'])

   In the above example, the -g would be added only if the $CCFLAGS
   variable does not already contain a -g value.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.3. Controlling the Execution Environment for Issued Commands

   When SCons builds a target file, it does not execute the commands with
   the same external environment that you used to execute SCons. Instead,
   it uses the dictionary stored in the [267]$ENV construction variable as
   the external environment for executing commands.

   The most important ramification of this behavior is that the PATH
   environment variable, which controls where the operating system will
   look for commands and utilities, is not the same as in the external
   environment from which you called SCons. This means that SCons will
   not, by default, necessarily find all of the tools that you can execute
   from the command line.

   The default value of the PATH environment variable on a POSIX system is
   /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin. The default value of the PATH environment
   variable on a Windows system comes from the Windows registry value for
   the command interpreter. If you want to execute any
   commands--compilers, linkers, etc.--that are not in these default
   locations, you need to set the PATH value in the $ENV dictionary in
   your construction environment.

   The simplest way to do this is to initialize explicitly the value when
   you create the construction environment; this is one way to do that:
      path = ['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin']
      env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : path})

   Assign a dictionary to the $ENV construction variable in this way
   completely resets the external environment so that the only variable
   that will be set when external commands are executed will be the PATH
   value. If you want to use the rest of the values in $ENV and only set
   the value of PATH, the most straightforward way is probably:
      env['ENV']['PATH'] = ['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin']

   Note that SCons does allow you to define the directories in the PATH in
   a string, separated by the pathname-separator character for your system
   (':' on POSIX systems, ';' on Windows):
      env['ENV']['PATH'] = '/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin'

   But doing so makes your SConscript file less portable, (although in
   this case that may not be a huge concern since the directories you list
   are likley system-specific, anyway).
     __________________________________________________________________

7.3.1. Propagating PATH From the External Environment

   You may want to propagate the external PATH to the execution
   environment for commands. You do this by initializing the PATH variable
   with the PATH value from the os.environ dictionary, which is Python's
   way of letting you get at the external environment:
        import os
        env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})

   Alternatively, you may find it easier to just propagate the entire
   external environment to the execution environment for commands. This is
   simpler to code than explicity selecting the PATH value:
        import os
        env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)

   Either of these will guarantee that SCons will be able to execute any
   command that you can execute from the command line. The drawback is
   that the build can behave differently if it's run by people with
   different PATH values in their environment--for example, if both the
   /bin and /usr/local/bin directories have different cc commands, then
   which one will be used to compile programs will depend on which
   directory is listed first in the user's PATH variable.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.3.2. Adding to PATH Values in the Execution Environment

   One of the most common requirements for manipulating a variable in the
   execution environment is to add one or more custom directories to a
   search like the $PATH variable on Linux or POSIX systems, or the %PATH%
   variable on Windows, so that a locally-installed compiler or other
   utility can be found when SCons tries to execute it to update a target.
   SCons provides PrependENVPath and AppendENVPath functions to make
   adding things to execution variables convenient. You call these
   functions by specifying the variable to which you want the value added,
   and then value itself. So to add some /usr/local directories to the
   $PATH and $LIB variables, you might:
        env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)
        env.PrependENVPath('PATH', '/usr/local/bin')
        env.AppendENVPath('LIB', '/usr/local/lib')

   Note that the added values are strings, and if you want to add multiple
   directories to a variable like $PATH, you must include the path
   separate character (: on Linux or POSIX, ; on Windows) in the string.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 8. Merging Options into the Environment: the MergeFlags Function

   SCons construction environments have a MergeFlags method that merges a
   dictionary of values into the construction environment. MergeFlags
   treats each value in the dictionary as a list of options such as one
   might pass to a command (such as a compiler or linker). MergeFlags will
   not duplicate an option if it already exists in the construction
   environment variable.

   MergeFlags tries to be intelligent about merging options. When merging
   options to any variable whose name ends in PATH, MergeFlags keeps the
   leftmost occurrence of the option, because in typical lists of
   directory paths, the first occurrence "wins." When merging options to
   any other variable name, MergeFlags keeps the rightmost occurrence of
   the option, because in a list of typical command-line options, the last
   occurrence "wins."
    env = Environment()
    env.Append(CCFLAGS = '-option -O3 -O1')
    flags = { 'CCFLAGS' : '-whatever -O3' }
    env.MergeFlags(flags)
    print env['CCFLAGS']

    % scons -Q
    ['-option', '-O1', '-whatever', '-O3']
    scons: `.' is up to date.

   Note that the default value for [268]$CCFLAGS is an internal SCons
   object which automatically converts the options we specified as a
   string into a list.
    env = Environment()
    env.Append(CPPPATH = ['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include'])
    flags = { 'CPPPATH' : ['/usr/opt/include', '/usr/local/include'] }
    env.MergeFlags(flags)
    print env['CPPPATH']

    % scons -Q
    ['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include', '/usr/opt/include']
    scons: `.' is up to date.

   Note that the default value for [269]$CPPPATH is a normal Python list,
   so we must specify its values as a list in the dictionary we pass to
   the MergeFlags function.

   If MergeFlags is passed anything other than a dictionary, it calls the
   ParseFlags method to convert it into a dictionary.
    env = Environment()
    env.Append(CCFLAGS = '-option -O3 -O1')
    env.Append(CPPPATH = ['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include'])
    env.MergeFlags('-whatever -I/usr/opt/include -O3 -I/usr/local/include')
    print env['CCFLAGS']
    print env['CPPPATH']

    % scons -Q
    ['-option', '-O1', '-whatever', '-O3']
    ['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include', '/usr/opt/include']
    scons: `.' is up to date.

   In the combined example above, ParseFlags has sorted the options into
   their corresponding variables and returned a dictionary for MergeFlags
   to apply to the construction variables in the specified construction
   environment.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 9. Separating Compile Arguments into their Variables: the ParseFlags
Function

   SCons has a bewildering array of construction variables for different
   types of options when building programs. Sometimes you may not know
   exactly which variable should be used for a particular option.

   SCons construction environments have a ParseFlags method that takes a
   set of typical command-line options and distrbutes them into the
   appropriate construction variables. Historically, it was created to
   support the ParseConfig method, so it focuses on options used by the
   GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for the C and C++ toolchains.

   ParseFlags returns a dictionary containing the options distributed into
   their respective construction variables. Normally, this dictionary
   would be passed to MergeFlags to merge the options into a construction
   environment, but the dictionary can be edited if desired to provide
   additional functionality. (Note that if the flags are not going to be
   edited, calling MergeFlags with the options directly will avoid an
   additional step.)
    env = Environment()
    d = env.ParseFlags("-I/opt/include -L/opt/lib -lfoo")
    for k,v in sorted(d.items()):
        if v:
            print k, v
    env.MergeFlags(d)
    env.Program('f1.c')

    % scons -Q
    CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
    LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
    LIBS ['foo']
    cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
    cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

   Note that if the options are limited to generic types like those above,
   they will be correctly translated for other platform types:
    C:\>scons -Q
    CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
    LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
    LIBS ['foo']
    cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo /I\opt\include
    link /nologo /OUT:f1.exe /LIBPATH:\opt\lib foo.lib f1.obj

   Since the assumption is that the flags are used for the GCC toolchain,
   unrecognized flags are placed in [270]$CCFLAGS so they will be used for
   both C and C++ compiles:
    env = Environment()
    d = env.ParseFlags("-whatever")
    for k,v in sorted(d.items()):
        if v:
            print k, v
    env.MergeFlags(d)
    env.Program('f1.c')

    % scons -Q
    CCFLAGS -whatever
    cc -o f1.o -c -whatever f1.c
    cc -o f1 f1.o

   ParseFlags will also accept a (recursive) list of strings as input; the
   list is flattened before the strings are processed:
    env = Environment()
    d = env.ParseFlags(["-I/opt/include", ["-L/opt/lib", "-lfoo"]])
    for k,v in sorted(d.items()):
        if v:
            print k, v
    env.MergeFlags(d)
    env.Program('f1.c')

    % scons -Q
    CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
    LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
    LIBS ['foo']
    cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
    cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

   If a string begins with a "!" (an exclamation mark, often called a
   bang), the string is passed to the shell for execution. The output of
   the command is then parsed:
    env = Environment()
    d = env.ParseFlags(["!echo -I/opt/include", "!echo -L/opt/lib", "-lfoo"])
    for k,v in sorted(d.items()):
        if v:
            print k, v
    env.MergeFlags(d)
    env.Program('f1.c')

    % scons -Q
    CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
    LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
    LIBS ['foo']
    cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
    cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

   ParseFlags is regularly updated for new options; consult the man page
   for details about those currently recognized.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 10. Finding Installed Library Information: the ParseConfig Function

   Configuring the right options to build programs to work with
   libraries--especially shared libraries--that are available on POSIX
   systems can be very complicated. To help this situation, various
   utilies with names that end in config return the command-line options
   for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) that are needed to use these
   libraries; for example, the command-line options to use a library named
   lib would be found by calling a utility named lib-config.

   A more recent convention is that these options are available from the
   generic pkg-config program, which has common framework, error handling,
   and the like, so that all the package creator has to do is provide the
   set of strings for his particular package.

   SCons construction environments have a ParseConfig method that executes
   a *config utility (either pkg-config or a more specific utility) and
   configures the appropriate construction variables in the environment
   based on the command-line options returned by the specified command.
    env = Environment()
    env['CPPPATH'] = ['/lib/compat']
    env.ParseConfig("pkg-config x11 --cflags --libs")
    print env['CPPPATH']

   SCons will execute the specified command string, parse the resultant
   flags, and add the flags to the appropriate environment variables.
    % scons -Q
    ['/lib/compat', '/usr/X11/include']
    scons: `.' is up to date.

   In the example above, SCons has added the include directory to CPPPATH.
   (Depending upon what other flags are emitted by the pkg-config command,
   other variables may have been extended as well.)

   Note that the options are merged with existing options using the
   MergeFlags method, so that each option only occurs once in the
   construction variable:
    env = Environment()
    env.ParseConfig("pkg-config x11 --cflags --libs")
    env.ParseConfig("pkg-config x11 --cflags --libs")
    print env['CPPPATH']

    % scons -Q
    ['/usr/X11/include']
    scons: `.' is up to date.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 11. Controlling Build Output

   A key aspect of creating a usable build configuration is providing good
   output from the build so its users can readily understand what the
   build is doing and get information about how to control the build.
   SCons provides several ways of controlling output from the build
   configuration to help make the build more useful and understandable.
     __________________________________________________________________

11.1. Providing Build Help: the Help Function

   It's often very useful to be able to give users some help that
   describes the specific targets, build options, etc., that can be used
   for your build. SCons provides the Help function to allow you to
   specify this help text:
       Help("""
       Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
             'scons debug' to build the debug version.
       """)

   (Note the above use of the Python triple-quote syntax, which comes in
   very handy for specifying multi-line strings like help text.)

   When the SConstruct or SConscript files contain such a call to the Help
   function, the specified help text will be displayed in response to the
   SCons -h option:
       % scons -h
       scons: Reading SConscript files ...
       scons: done reading SConscript files.

       Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
             'scons debug' to build the debug version.

       Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   The SConscript files may contain multiple calls to the Help function,
   in which case the specified text(s) will be concatenated when
   displayed. This allows you to split up the help text across multiple
   SConscript files. In this situation, the order in which the SConscript
   files are called will determine the order in which the Help functions
   are called, which will determine the order in which the various bits of
   text will get concatenated.

   Another use would be to make the help text conditional on some
   variable. For example, suppose you only want to display a line about
   building a Windows-only version of a program when actually run on
   Windows. The following SConstruct file:
       env = Environment()

       Help("\nType: 'scons program' to build the production program.\n")

       if env['PLATFORM'] == 'win32':
           Help("\nType: 'scons windebug' to build the Windows debug version.\n"
)

   Will display the complete help text on Windows:
       C:\>scons -h
       scons: Reading SConscript files ...
       scons: done reading SConscript files.

       Type: 'scons program' to build the production program.

       Type: 'scons windebug' to build the Windows debug version.

       Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   But only show the relevant option on a Linux or UNIX system:
       % scons -h
       scons: Reading SConscript files ...
       scons: done reading SConscript files.

       Type: 'scons program' to build the production program.

       Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   If there is no Help text in the SConstruct or SConscript files, SCons
   will revert to displaying its standard list that describes the SCons
   command-line options. This list is also always displayed whenever the
   -H option is used.
     __________________________________________________________________

11.2. Controlling How SCons Prints Build Commands: the $*COMSTR Variables

   Sometimes the commands executed to compile object files or link
   programs (or build other targets) can get very long, long enough to
   make it difficult for users to distinguish error messages or other
   important build output from the commands themselves. All of the default
   $*COM variables that specify the command lines used to build various
   types of target files have a corresponding $*COMSTR variable that can
   be set to an alternative string that will be displayed when the target
   is built.

   For example, suppose you want to have SCons display a "Compiling"
   message whenever it's compiling an object file, and a "Linking" when
   it's linking an executable. You could write a SConstruct file that
   looks like:
       env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling $TARGET",
                         LINKCOMSTR = "Linking $TARGET")
       env.Program('foo.c')

   Which would then yield the output:
       % scons -Q
       Compiling foo.o
       Linking foo

   SCons performs complete variable substitution on $*COMSTR variables, so
   they have access to all of the standard variables like $TARGET
   $SOURCES, etc., as well as any construction variables that happen to be
   configured in the construction environment used to build a specific
   target.

   Of course, sometimes it's still important to be able to see the exact
   command that SCons will execute to build a target. For example, you may
   simply need to verify that SCons is configured to supply the right
   options to the compiler, or a developer may want to cut-and-paste a
   compile command to add a few options for a custom test.

   One common way to give users control over whether or not SCons should
   print the actual command line or a short, configured summary is to add
   support for a VERBOSE command-line variable to your SConstruct file. A
   simple configuration for this might look like:
       env = Environment()
       if ARGUMENTS.get('VERBOSE') != "1':
           env['CCCOMSTR'] = "Compiling $TARGET"
           env['LINKCOMSTR'] = "Linking $TARGET"
       env.Program('foo.c')

   By only setting the appropriate $*COMSTR variables if the user
   specifies VERBOSE=1 on the command line, the user has control over how
   SCons displays these particular command lines:
       % scons -Q
       Compiling foo.o
       Linking foo
       % scons -Q -c
       Removed foo.o
       Removed foo
       % scons -Q VERBOSE=1
       cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
       cc -o foo foo.o
     __________________________________________________________________

11.3. Providing Build Progress Output: the Progress Function

   Another aspect of providing good build output is to give the user
   feedback about what SCons is doing even when nothing is being built at
   the moment. This can be especially true for large builds when most of
   the targets are already up-to-date. Because SCons can take a long time
   making absolutely sure that every target is, in fact, up-to-date with
   respect to a lot of dependency files, it can be easy for users to
   mistakenly conclude that SCons is hung or that there is some other
   problem with the build.

   One way to deal with this perception is to configure SCons to print
   something to let the user know what it's "thinking about." The Progress
   function allows you to specify a string that will be printed for every
   file that SCons is "considering" while it is traversing the dependency
   graph to decide what targets are or are not up-to-date.
        Progress('Evaluating $TARGET\n')
        Program('f1.c')
        Program('f2.c')

   Note that the Progress function does not arrange for a newline to be
   printed automatically at the end of the string (as does the Python
   print statement), and we must specify the \n that we want printed at
   the end of the configured string. This configuration, then, will have
   SCons print that it is Evaluating each file that it encounters in turn
   as it traverses the dependency graph:
       % scons -Q
       Evaluating SConstruct
       Evaluating f1.c
       Evaluating f1.o
       cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
       Evaluating f1
       cc -o f1 f1.o
       Evaluating f2.c
       Evaluating f2.o
       cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
       Evaluating f2
       cc -o f2 f2.o
       Evaluating .

   Of course, normally you don't want to add all of these additional lines
   to your build output, as that can make it difficult for the user to
   find errors or other important messages. A more useful way to display
   this progress might be to have the file names printed directly to the
   user's screen, not to the same standard output stream where build
   output is printed, and to use a carriage return character (\r) so that
   each file name gets re-printed on the same line. Such a configuration
   would look like:
        Progress('$TARGET\r',
                 file=open('/dev/tty', 'w'),
                 overwrite=True)
        Program('f1.c')
        Program('f2.c')

   Note that we also specified the overwrite=True argument to the Progress
   function, which causes SCons to "wipe out" the previous string with
   space characters before printing the next Progress string. Without the
   overwrite=True argument, a shorter file name would not overwrite all of
   the charactes in a longer file name that precedes it, making it
   difficult to tell what the actual file name is on the output. Also note
   that we opened up the /dev/tty file for direct access (on POSIX) to the
   user's screen. On Windows, the equivalent would be to open the con:
   file name.

   Also, it's important to know that although you can use $TARGET to
   substitute the name of the node in the string, the Progress function
   does not perform general variable substitution (because there's not
   necessarily a construction environment involved in evaluating a node
   like a source file, for example).

   You can also specify a list of strings to the Progress function, in
   which case SCons will display each string in turn. This can be used to
   implement a "spinner" by having SCons cycle through a sequence of
   strings:
        Progress(['-\r', '\\\r', '|\r', '/\r'], interval=5)
        Program('f1.c')
        Program('f2.c')

   Note that here we have also used the interval= keyword argument to have
   SCons only print a new "spinner" string once every five evaluated
   nodes. Using an interval= count, even with strings that use $TARGET
   like our examples above, can be a good way to lessen the work that
   SCons expends printing Progress strings, while still giving the user
   feedback that indicates SCons is still working on evaluating the build.

   Lastly, you can have direct control over how to print each evaluated
   node by passing a Python function (or other Python callable) to the
   Progress function. Your function will be called for each evaluated
   node, allowing you to implement more sophisticated logic like adding a
   counter:
        screen = open('/dev/tty', 'w')
        count = 0
        def progress_function(node)
            count += 1
            screen.write('Node %4d: %s\r' % (count, node))

        Progress(progress_function)

   Of course, if you choose, you could completely ignore the node argument
   to the function, and just print a count, or anything else you wish.

   (Note that there's an obvious follow-on question here: how would you
   find the total number of nodes that will be evaluated so you can tell
   the user how close the build is to finishing? Unfortunately, in the
   general case, there isn't a good way to do that, short of having SCons
   evaluate its dependency graph twice, first to count the total and the
   second time to actually build the targets. This would be necessary
   because you can't know in advance which target(s) the user actually
   requested to be built. The entire build may consist of thousands of
   Nodes, for example, but maybe the user specifically requested that only
   a single object file be built.)
     __________________________________________________________________

11.4. Printing Detailed Build Status: the GetBuildFailures Function

   SCons, like most build tools, returns zero status to the shell on
   success and nonzero status on failure. Sometimes it's useful to give
   more information about the build status at the end of the run, for
   instance to print an informative message, send an email, or page the
   poor slob who broke the build.

   SCons provides a GetBuildFailures method that you can use in a python
   atexit function to get a list of objects describing the actions that
   failed while attempting to build targets. There can be more than one if
   you're using -j. Here's a simple example:
        import atexit

        def print_build_failures():
            from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
            for bf in GetBuildFailures():
                print "%s failed: %s" % (bf.node, bf.errstr)
        atexit.register(print_build_failures)

   The atexit.register call registers print_build_failures as an atexit
   callback, to be called before SCons exits. When that function is
   called, it calls GetBuildFailures to fetch the list of failed objects.
   See the man page for the detailed contents of the returned objects;
   some of the more useful attributes are .node, .errstr, .filename, and
   .command. The filename is not necessarily the same file as the node;
   the node is the target that was being built when the error occurred,
   while the filenameis the file or dir that actually caused the error.
   Note: only call GetBuildFailures at the end of the build; calling it at
   any other time is undefined.

   Here is a more complete example showing how to turn each element of
   GetBuildFailures into a string:
        # Make the build fail if we pass fail=1 on the command line
        if ARGUMENTS.get('fail', 0):
            Command('target', 'source', ['/bin/false'])

        def bf_to_str(bf):
            """Convert an element of GetBuildFailures() to a string
            in a useful way."""
            import SCons.Errors
            if bf is None: # unknown targets product None in list
                return '(unknown tgt)'
            elif isinstance(bf, SCons.Errors.StopError):
                return str(bf)
            elif bf.node:
                return str(bf.node) + ': ' + bf.errstr
            elif bf.filename:
                return bf.filename + ': ' + bf.errstr
            return 'unknown failure: ' + bf.errstr
        import atexit

        def build_status():
            """Convert the build status to a 2-tuple, (status, msg)."""
            from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
            bf = GetBuildFailures()
            if bf:
                # bf is normally a list of build failures; if an element is None
,
                # it's because of a target that scons doesn't know anything abou
t.
                status = 'failed'
                failures_message = "\n".join(["Failed building %s" % bf_to_str(x
)
                                   for x in bf if x is not None])
            else:
                # if bf is None, the build completed successfully.
                status = 'ok'
                failures_message = ''
            return (status, failures_message)

        def display_build_status():
            """Display the build status.  Called by atexit.
            Here you could do all kinds of complicated things."""
            status, failures_message = build_status()
            if status == 'failed':
               print "FAILED!!!!"  # could display alert, ring bell, etc.
            elif status == 'ok':
               print "Build succeeded."
            print failures_message

        atexit.register(display_build_status)

   When this runs, you'll see the appropriate output:
          % scons -Q
          scons: `.' is up to date.
          Build succeeded.
          % scons -Q fail=1
          scons: *** [target] Source `source' not found, needed by target `targe
t'.
          FAILED!!!!
          Failed building target: Source `source' not found, needed by target `t
arget'.

Chapter 12. Controlling a Build From the Command Line

   SCons provides a number of ways for the writer of the SConscript files
   to give the users who will run SCons a great deal of control over the
   build execution. The arguments that the user can specify on the command
   line are broken down into three types:

   Options
          Command-line options always begin with one or two - (hyphen)
          characters. SCons provides ways for you to examine and set
          options values from within your SConscript files, as well as the
          ability to define your own custom options. See [271]Section
          12.1, below.

   Variables
          Any command-line argument containing an = (equal sign) is
          considered a variable setting with the form variable=value SCons
          provides direct access to all of the command-line variable
          settings, the ability to apply command-line variable settings to
          construction environments, and functions for configuring
          specific types of variables (Boolean values, path names, etc.)
          with automatic validation of the user's specified values. See
          [272]Section 12.2, below.

   Targets
          Any command-line argument that is not an option or a variable
          setting (does not begin with a hyphen and does not contain an
          equal sign) is considered a target that the user (presumably)
          wants SCons to build. A list of Node objects representing the
          target or targets to build. SCons provides access to the list of
          specified targets, as well as ways to set the default list of
          targets from within the SConscript files. See [273]Section 12.3,
          below.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.1. Command-Line Options

   SCons has many command-line options that control its behavior. A SCons
   command-line option always begins with one or two - (hyphen)
   characters.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.1.1. Not Having to Specify Command-Line Options Each Time: the SCONSFLAGS
Environment Variable

   Users may find themselves supplying the same command-line options every
   time they run SCons. For example, you might find it saves time to
   specify a value of -j 2 to have SCons run up to two build commands in
   parallel. To avoid having to type -j 2 by hand every time, you can set
   the external environment variable SCONSFLAGS to a string containing
   command-line options that you want SCons to use.

   If, for example, you're using a POSIX shell that's compatible with the
   Bourne shell, and you always want SCons to use the -Q option, you can
   set the SCONSFLAGS environment as follows:
        % scons
        scons: Reading SConscript files ...
        scons: done reading SConscript files.
        scons: Building targets ...
            ... [build output] ...
        scons: done building targets.
        % export SCONSFLAGS="-Q"
        % scons
            ... [build output] ...

   Users of csh-style shells on POSIX systems can set the SCONSFLAGS
   environment as follows:
        $ setenv SCONSFLAGS "-Q"

   Windows users may typically want to set the SCONSFLAGS in the
   appropriate tab of the System Properties window.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.1.2. Getting Values Set by Command-Line Options: the GetOption Function

   SCons provides the GetOption function to get the values set by the
   various command-line options. One common use of this is to check
   whether or not the -h or --help option has been specified. Normally,
   SCons does not print its help text until after it has read all of the
   SConscript files, because it's possible that help text has been added
   by some subsidiary SConscript file deep in the source tree hierarchy.
   Of course, reading all of the SConscript files takes extra time.

   If you know that your configuration does not define any additional help
   text in subsidiary SConscript files, you can speed up the command-line
   help available to users by using the GetOption function to load the
   subsidiary SConscript files only if the the user has not specified the
   -h or --help option, like so:

   In general, the string that you pass to the GetOption function to fetch
   the value of a command-line option setting is the same as the "most
   common" long option name (beginning with two hyphen characters),
   although there are some exceptions. The list of SCons command-line
   options and the GetOption strings for fetching them, are available in
   the [274]Section 12.1.4 section, below.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.1.3. Setting Values of Command-Line Options: the SetOption Function

   You can also set the values of SCons command-line options from within
   the SConscript files by using the SetOption function. The strings that
   you use to set the values of SCons command-line options are available
   in the [275]Section 12.1.4 section, below.

   One use of the SetOption function is to specify a value for the -j or
   --jobs option, so that users get the improved performance of a parallel
   build without having to specify the option by hand. A complicating
   factor is that a good value for the -j option is somewhat
   system-dependent. One rough guideline is that the more processors your
   system has, the higher you want to set the -j value, in order to take
   advantage of the number of CPUs.

   For example, suppose the administrators of your development systems
   have standardized on setting a NUM_CPU environment variable to the
   number of processors on each system. A little bit of Python code to
   access the environment variable and the SetOption function provide the
   right level of flexibility:
        import os
        num_cpu = int(os.environ.get('NUM_CPU', 2))
        SetOption('num_jobs', num_cpu)
        print "running with -j", GetOption('num_jobs')

   The above snippet of code sets the value of the --jobs option to the
   value specified in the $NUM_CPU environment variable. (This is one of
   the exception cases where the string is spelled differently from the
   from command-line option. The string for fetching or setting the --jobs
   value is num_jobs for historical reasons.) The code in this example
   prints the num_jobs value for illustrative purposes. It uses a default
   value of 2 to provide some minimal parallelism even on single-processor
   systems:
        % scons -Q
        running with -j 2
        scons: `.' is up to date.

   But if the $NUM_CPU environment variable is set, then we use that for
   the default number of jobs:
        % export NUM_CPU="4"
        % scons -Q
        running with -j 4
        scons: `.' is up to date.

   But any explicit -j or --jobs value the user specifies an the command
   line is used first, regardless of whether or not the $NUM_CPU
   environment variable is set:
        % scons -Q -j 7
        running with -j 7
        scons: `.' is up to date.
        % export NUM_CPU="4"
        % scons -Q -j 3
        running with -j 3
        scons: `.' is up to date.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.1.4. Strings for Getting or Setting Values of SCons Command-Line Options

   The strings that you can pass to the GetOption and SetOption functions
   usually correspond to the first long-form option name (beginning with
   two hyphen characters: --), after replacing any remaining hyphen
   characters with underscores.

   The full list of strings and the variables they correspond to is as
   follows:

   String for GetOption and SetOption Command-Line Option(s)
   cache_debug --cache-debug
   cache_disable --cache-disable
   cache_force --cache-force
   cache_show --cache-show
   clean -c, --clean, --remove
   config --config
   directory -C, --directory
   diskcheck --diskcheck
   duplicate --duplicate
   file -f, --file, --makefile , --sconstruct
   help -h, --help
   ignore_errors --ignore-errors
   implicit_cache --implicit-cache
   implicit_deps_changed --implicit-deps-changed
   implicit_deps_unchanged --implicit-deps-unchanged
   interactive --interact, --interactive
   keep_going -k, --keep-going
   max_drift --max-drift
   no_exec -n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
   no_site_dir --no-site-dir
   num_jobs -j, --jobs
   profile_file --profile
   question -q, --question
   random --random
   repository -Y, --repository, --srcdir
   silent -s, --silent, --quiet
   site_dir --site-dir
   stack_size --stack-size
   taskmastertrace_file --taskmastertrace
   warn --warn --warning
     __________________________________________________________________

12.1.5. Adding Custom Command-Line Options: the AddOption Function

   SCons also allows you to define your own command-line options with the
   AddOption function. The AddOption function takes the same arguments as
   the optparse.add_option function from the standard Python library.
   [276][3] Once you have added a custom command-line option with the
   AddOption function, the value of the option (if any) is immediately
   available using the standard GetOption function. (The value can also be
   set using SetOption, although that's not very useful in practice
   because a default value can be specified in directly in the AddOption
   call.)

   One useful example of using this functionality is to provide a --prefix
   for users:
        AddOption('--prefix',
                  dest='prefix',
                  type='string',
                  nargs=1,
                  action='store',
                  metavar='DIR',
                  help='installation prefix')

        env = Environment(PREFIX = GetOption('prefix'))

        installed_foo = env.Install('$PREFIX/usr/bin', 'foo.in')
        Default(installed_foo)

   The above code uses the GetOption function to set the $PREFIX
   construction variable to any value that the user specifies with a
   command-line option of --prefix. Because $PREFIX will expand to a null
   string if it's not initialized, running SCons without the option of
   --prefix will install the file in the /usr/bin/ directory:
        % scons -Q -n
        Install file: "foo.in" as "/usr/bin/foo.in"

   But specifying --prefix=/tmp/install on the command line causes the
   file to be installed in the /tmp/install/usr/bin/ directory:
        % scons -Q -n --prefix=/tmp/install
        Install file: "foo.in" as "/tmp/install/usr/bin/foo.in"
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2. Command-Line variable=value Build Variables

   You may want to control various aspects of your build by allowing the
   user to specify variable=value values on the command line. For example,
   suppose you want users to be able to build a debug version of a program
   by running SCons as follows:
      % scons -Q debug=1

   SCons provides an ARGUMENTS dictionary that stores all of the
   variable=value assignments from the command line. This allows you to
   modify aspects of your build in response to specifications on the
   command line. (Note that unless you want to require that users always
   specify a variable, you probably want to use the Python ARGUMENTS.get()
   function, which allows you to specify a default value to be used if
   there is no specification on the command line.)

   The following code sets the [277]$CCFLAGS construction variable in
   response to the debug flag being set in the ARGUMENTS dictionary:
       env = Environment()
       debug = ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0)
       if int(debug):
           env.Append(CCFLAGS = '-g')
       env.Program('prog.c')

   This results in the -g compiler option being used when debug=1 is used
   on the command line:
       % scons -Q debug=0
       cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
       cc -o prog prog.o
       % scons -Q debug=0
       scons: `.' is up to date.
       % scons -Q debug=1
       cc -o prog.o -c -g prog.c
       cc -o prog prog.o
       % scons -Q debug=1
       scons: `.' is up to date.

   Notice that SCons keeps track of the last values used to build the
   object files, and as a result correctly rebuilds the object and
   executable files only when the value of the debug argument has changed.

   The ARGUMENTS dictionary has two minor drawbacks. First, because it is
   a dictionary, it can only store one value for each specified keyword,
   and thus only "remembers" the last setting for each keyword on the
   command line. This makes the ARGUMENTS dictionary inappropriate if
   users should be able to specify multiple values on the command line for
   a given keyword. Second, it does not preserve the order in which the
   variable settings were specified, which is a problem if you want the
   configuration to behave differently in response to the order in which
   the build variable settings were specified on the command line.

   To accomodate these requirements, SCons provides an ARGLIST variable
   that gives you direct access to variable=value settings on the command
   line, in the exact order they were specified, and without removing any
   duplicate settings. Each element in the ARGLIST variable is itself a
   two-element list containing the keyword and the value of the setting,
   and you must loop through, or otherwise select from, the elements of
   ARGLIST to process the specific settings you want in whatever way is
   appropriate for your configuration. For example, the following code to
   let the user add to the CPPDEFINES construction variable by specifying
   multiple define= settings on the command line:
       cppdefines = []
       for key, value in ARGLIST:
           if key == 'define':
               cppdefines.append(value)
       env = Environment(CPPDEFINES = cppdefines)
       env.Object('prog.c')

   Yields the following output:
       % scons -Q define=FOO
       cc -o prog.o -c -DFOO prog.c
       % scons -Q define=FOO define=BAR
       cc -o prog.o -c -DFOO -DBAR prog.c

   Note that the ARGLIST and ARGUMENTS variables do not interfere with
   each other, but merely provide slightly different views into how the
   user specified variable=value settings on the command line. You can use
   both variables in the same SCons configuration. In general, the
   ARGUMENTS dictionary is more convenient to use, (since you can just
   fetch variable settings through a dictionary access), and the ARGLIST
   list is more flexible (since you can examine the specific order in
   which the user's command-line variabe settings).

12.2.1. Controlling Command-Line Build Variables

   Being able to use a command-line build variable like debug=1 is handy,
   but it can be a chore to write specific Python code to recognize each
   such variable, check for errors and provide appropriate messages, and
   apply the values to a construction variable. To help with this, SCons
   supports a class to define such build variables easily, and a mechanism
   to apply the build variables to a construction environment. This allows
   you to control how the build variables affect construction
   environments.

   For example, suppose that you want users to set a RELEASE construction
   variable on the command line whenever the time comes to build a program
   for release, and that the value of this variable should be added to the
   command line with the appropriate -D option (or other command line
   option) to pass the value to the C compiler. Here's how you might do
   that by setting the appropriate value in a dictionary for the
   [278]$CPPDEFINES construction variable:
           vars = Variables()
           vars.Add('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0)
           env = Environment(variables = vars,
                             CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD' : '${RELEASE}'})
           env.Program(['foo.c', 'bar.c'])

   This SConstruct file first creates a Variables object (the vars =
   Variables() call), and then uses the object's Add method to indicate
   that the RELEASE variable can be set on the command line, and that its
   default value will be 0 (the third argument to the Add method). The
   second argument is a line of help text; we'll learn how to use it in
   the next section.

   We then pass the created Variables object as a variables keyword
   argument to the Environment call used to create the construction
   environment. This then allows a user to set the RELEASE build variable
   on the command line and have the variable show up in the command line
   used to build each object from a C source file:
        % scons -Q RELEASE=1
        cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 bar.c
        cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 foo.c
        cc -o foo foo.o bar.o

   NOTE: Before SCons release 0.98.1, these build variables were known as
   "command-line build options." The class was actually named the Options
   class, and in the sections below, the various functions were named
   BoolOption, EnumOption, ListOption, PathOption, PackageOption and
   AddOptions. These older names still work, and you may encounter them in
   older SConscript fles, but they have been officially deprecated as of
   SCons version 2.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2.2. Providing Help for Command-Line Build Variables

   To make command-line build variables most useful, you ideally want to
   provide some help text that will describe the available variables when
   the user runs scons -h. You could write this text by hand, but SCons
   provides an easier way. Variables objects support a GenerateHelpText
   method that will, as its name suggests, generate text that describes
   the various variables that have been added to it. You then pass the
   output from this method to the Help function:
           vars = Variables('custom.py')
           vars.Add('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0)
           env = Environment(variables = vars)
           Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

   SCons will now display some useful text when the -h option is used:
        % scons -Q -h

        RELEASE: Set to 1 to build for release
            default: 0
            actual: 0

        Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   Notice that the help output shows the default value, and the current
   actual value of the build variable.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2.3. Reading Build Variables From a File

   Giving the user a way to specify the value of a build variable on the
   command line is useful, but can still be tedious if users must specify
   the variable every time they run SCons. We can let users provide
   customized build variable settings in a local file by providing a file
   name when we create the Variables object:
           vars = Variables('custom.py')
           vars.Add('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0)
           env = Environment(variables = vars,
                             CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD' : '${RELEASE}'})
           env.Program(['foo.c', 'bar.c'])
           Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

   This then allows the user to control the RELEASE variable by setting it
   in the custom.py file:
        RELEASE = 1

   Note that this file is actually executed like a Python script. Now when
   we run SCons:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 bar.c
        cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 foo.c
        cc -o foo foo.o bar.o

   And if we change the contents of custom.py to:
        RELEASE = 0

   The object files are rebuilt appropriately with the new variable:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 bar.c
        cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 foo.c
        cc -o foo foo.o bar.o
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2.4. Pre-Defined Build Variable Functions

   SCons provides a number of functions that provide ready-made behaviors
   for various types of command-line build variables.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2.4.1. True/False Values: the BoolVariable Build Variable Function

   It's often handy to be able to specify a variable that controls a
   simple Boolean variable with a true or false value. It would be even
   more handy to accomodate users who have different preferences for how
   to represent true or false values. The BoolVariable function makes it
   easy to accomodate these common representations of true or false.

   The BoolVariable function takes three arguments: the name of the build
   variable, the default value of the build variable, and the help string
   for the variable. It then returns appropriate information for passing
   to the Add method of a Variables object, like so:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(BoolVariable('RELEASE', 'Set to build for release', 0))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD' : '${RELEASE}'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   With this build variable, the RELEASE variable can now be enabled by
   setting it to the value yes or t:
          % scons -Q RELEASE=yes foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=True foo.c

          % scons -Q RELEASE=t foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=True foo.c

   Other values that equate to true include y, 1, on and all.

   Conversely, RELEASE may now be given a false value by setting it to no
   or f:
          % scons -Q RELEASE=no foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=False foo.c

          % scons -Q RELEASE=f foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=False foo.c

   Other values that equate to false include n, 0, off and none.

   Lastly, if a user tries to specify any other value, SCons supplies an
   appropriate error message:
          % scons -Q RELEASE=bad_value foo.o

          scons: *** Error converting option: RELEASE
          Invalid value for boolean option: bad_value
          File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 4, in <module>
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2.4.2. Single Value From a List: the EnumVariable Build Variable Function

   Suppose that we want a user to be able to set a COLOR variable that
   selects a background color to be displayed by an application, but that
   we want to restrict the choices to a specific set of allowed colors.
   This can be set up quite easily using the EnumVariable, which takes a
   list of allowed_values in addition to the variable name, default value,
   and help text arguments:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(EnumVariable('COLOR', 'Set background color', 'red',
                                 allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue')))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   The user can now explicity set the COLOR build variable to any of the
   specified allowed values:
          % scons -Q COLOR=red foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="red" foo.c
          % scons -Q COLOR=blue foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
          % scons -Q COLOR=green foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c

   But, almost more importantly, an attempt to set COLOR to a value that's
   not in the list generates an error message:
          % scons -Q COLOR=magenta foo.o

          scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: magenta
          File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 5, in <module>

   The EnumVariable function also supports a way to map alternate names to
   allowed values. Suppose, for example, that we want to allow the user to
   use the word navy as a synonym for blue. We do this by adding a map
   dictionary that will map its key values to the desired legal value:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(EnumVariable('COLOR', 'Set background color', 'red',
                                 allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
                                 map={'navy':'blue'}))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   As desired, the user can then use navy on the command line, and SCons
   will translate it into blue when it comes time to use the COLOR
   variable to build a target:
          % scons -Q COLOR=navy foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c

   By default, when using the EnumVariable function, arguments that differ
   from the legal values only in case are treated as illegal values:
          % scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o

          scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: Red
          File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 5, in <module>
          % scons -Q COLOR=BLUE foo.o

          scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: BLUE
          File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 5, in <module>
          % scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o

          scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: nAvY
          File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 5, in <module>

   The EnumVariable function can take an additional ignorecase keyword
   argument that, when set to 1, tells SCons to allow case differences
   when the values are specified:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(EnumVariable('COLOR', 'Set background color', 'red',
                                 allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
                                 map={'navy':'blue'},
                                 ignorecase=1))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   Which yields the output:
          % scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="Red" foo.c
          % scons -Q COLOR=BLUE foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="BLUE" foo.c
          % scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
          % scons -Q COLOR=green foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c

   Notice that an ignorecase value of 1 preserves the case-spelling that
   the user supplied. If you want SCons to translate the names into
   lower-case, regardless of the case used by the user, specify an
   ignorecase value of 2:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(EnumVariable('COLOR', 'Set background color', 'red',
                                 allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
                                 map={'navy':'blue'},
                                 ignorecase=2))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'COLOR' : '"${COLOR}"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   Now SCons will use values of red, green or blue regardless of how the
   user spells those values on the command line:
          % scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="red" foo.c
          % scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
          % scons -Q COLOR=GREEN foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2.4.3. Multiple Values From a List: the ListVariable Build Variable
Function

   Another way in which you might want to allow users to control a build
   variable is to specify a list of one or more legal values. SCons
   supports this through the ListVariable function. If, for example, we
   want a user to be able to set a COLORS variable to one or more of the
   legal list of values:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(ListVariable('COLORS', 'List of colors', 0,
                                 ['red', 'green', 'blue']))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'COLORS' : '"${COLORS}"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   A user can now specify a comma-separated list of legal values, which
   will get translated into a space-separated list for passing to the any
   build commands:
          % scons -Q COLORS=red,blue foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="red blue" foo.c
          % scons -Q COLORS=blue,green,red foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="blue green red" foo.c

   In addition, the ListVariable function allows the user to specify
   explicit keywords of all or none to select all of the legal values, or
   none of them, respectively:
          % scons -Q COLORS=all foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="red green blue" foo.c
          % scons -Q COLORS=none foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="" foo.c

   And, of course, an illegal value still generates an error message:
          % scons -Q COLORS=magenta foo.o

          scons: *** Error converting option: COLORS
          Invalid value(s) for option: magenta
          File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 5, in <module>
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2.4.4. Path Names: the PathVariable Build Variable Function

   SCons supports a PathVariable function to make it easy to create a
   build variable to control an expected path name. If, for example, you
   need to define a variable in the preprocessor that controls the
   location of a configuration file:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(PathVariable('CONFIG',
                                 'Path to configuration file',
                                 '/etc/my_config'))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'CONFIG_FILE' : '"$CONFIG"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   This then allows the user to override the CONFIG build variable on the
   command line as necessary:
          % scons -Q foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DCONFIG_FILE="/etc/my_config" foo.c
          % scons -Q CONFIG=/usr/local/etc/other_config foo.o
          scons: `foo.o' is up to date.

   By default, PathVariable checks to make sure that the specified path
   exists and generates an error if it doesn't:
          % scons -Q CONFIG=/does/not/exist foo.o

          scons: *** Path for option CONFIG does not exist: /does/not/exist
          File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 6, in <module>

   PathVariable provides a number of methods that you can use to change
   this behavior. If you want to ensure that any specified paths are, in
   fact, files and not directories, use the PathVariable.PathIsFile
   method:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(PathVariable('CONFIG',
                                 'Path to configuration file',
                                 '/etc/my_config',
                                 PathVariable.PathIsFile))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'CONFIG_FILE' : '"$CONFIG"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   Conversely, to ensure that any specified paths are directories and not
   files, use the PathVariable.PathIsDir method:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(PathVariable('DBDIR',
                                 'Path to database directory',
                                 '/var/my_dbdir',
                                 PathVariable.PathIsDir))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'DBDIR' : '"$DBDIR"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   If you want to make sure that any specified paths are directories, and
   you would like the directory created if it doesn't already exist, use
   the PathVariable.PathIsDirCreate method:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(PathVariable('DBDIR',
                                 'Path to database directory',
                                 '/var/my_dbdir',
                                 PathVariable.PathIsDirCreate))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'DBDIR' : '"$DBDIR"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   Lastly, if you don't care whether the path exists, is a file, or a
   directory, use the PathVariable.PathAccept method to accept any path
   that the user supplies:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(PathVariable('OUTPUT',
                                 'Path to output file or directory',
                                 None,
                                 PathVariable.PathAccept))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'OUTPUT' : '"$OUTPUT"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2.4.5. Enabled/Disabled Path Names: the PackageVariable Build Variable
Function

   Sometimes you want to give users even more control over a path name
   variable, allowing them to explicitly enable or disable the path name
   by using yes or no keywords, in addition to allow them to supply an
   explicit path name. SCons supports the PackageVariable function to
   support this:
             vars = Variables('custom.py')
             vars.Add(PackageVariable('PACKAGE',
                                    'Location package',
                                    '/opt/location'))
             env = Environment(variables = vars,
                               CPPDEFINES={'PACKAGE' : '"$PACKAGE"'})
             env.Program('foo.c')

   When the SConscript file uses the PackageVariable funciton, user can
   now still use the default or supply an overriding path name, but can
   now explicitly set the specified variable to a value that indicates the
   package should be enabled (in which case the default should be used) or
   disabled:
          % scons -Q foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="/opt/location" foo.c
          % scons -Q PACKAGE=/usr/local/location foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="/usr/local/location" foo.c
          % scons -Q PACKAGE=yes foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="True" foo.c
          % scons -Q PACKAGE=no foo.o
          cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="False" foo.c
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2.5. Adding Multiple Command-Line Build Variables at Once

   Lastly, SCons provides a way to add multiple build variables to a
   Variables object at once. Instead of having to call the Add method
   multiple times, you can call the AddVariables method with a list of
   build variables to be added to the object. Each build variable is
   specified as either a tuple of arguments, just like you'd pass to the
   Add method itself, or as a call to one of the pre-defined functions for
   pre-packaged command-line build variables. in any order:
          vars = Variables()
          vars.AddVariables(
              ('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0),
              ('CONFIG', 'Configuration file', '/etc/my_config'),
              BoolVariable('warnings', 'compilation with -Wall and similiar', 1)
,
              EnumVariable('debug', 'debug output and symbols', 'no',
                         allowed_values=('yes', 'no', 'full'),
                         map={}, ignorecase=0),  # case sensitive
              ListVariable('shared',
                         'libraries to build as shared libraries',
                         'all',
                         names = list_of_libs),
              PackageVariable('x11',
                            'use X11 installed here (yes = search some places)',
                            'yes'),
              PathVariable('qtdir', 'where the root of Qt is installed', qtdir),
          )
     __________________________________________________________________

12.2.6. Handling Unknown Command-Line Build Variables: the UnknownVariables
Function

   Users may, of course, occasionally misspell variable names in their
   command-line settings. SCons does not generate an error or warning for
   any unknown variables the users specifies on the command line. (This is
   in no small part because you may be processing the arguments directly
   using the ARGUMENTS dictionary, and therefore SCons can't know in the
   general case whether a given "misspelled" variable is really unknown
   and a potential problem, or something that your SConscript file will
   handle directly with some Python code.)

   If, however, you're using a Variables object to define a specific set
   of command-line build variables that you expect users to be able to
   set, you may want to provide an error message or warning of your own if
   the user supplies a variable setting that is not among the defined list
   of variable names known to the Variables object. You can do this by
   calling the UnknownVariables method of the Variables object:
           vars = Variables(None)
           vars.Add('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0)
           env = Environment(variables = vars,
                             CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD' : '${RELEASE}'})
           unknown = vars.UnknownVariables()
           if unknown:
               print "Unknown variables:", unknown.keys()
               Exit(1)
           env.Program('foo.c')

   The UnknownVariables method returns a dictionary containing the
   keywords and values of any variables the user specified on the command
   line that are not among the variables known to the Variables object
   (from having been specified using the Variables object'sAdd method). In
   the examble above, we check for whether the dictionary returned by the
   UnknownVariables is non-empty, and if so print the Python list
   containing the names of the unknwown variables and then call the Exit
   function to terminate SCons:
        % scons -Q NOT_KNOWN=foo
        Unknown variables: ['NOT_KNOWN']

   Of course, you can process the items in the dictionary returned by the
   UnknownVariables function in any way appropriate to your build
   configuration, including just printing a warning message but not
   exiting, logging an error somewhere, etc.

   Note that you must delay the call of UnknownVariables until after you
   have applied the Variables object to a construction environment with
   the variables= keyword argument of an Environment call.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.3. Command-Line Targets

12.3.1. Fetching Command-Line Targets: the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS Variable

   SCons supports a COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable that lets you fetch the
   list of targets that the user specified on the command line. You can
   use the targets to manipulate the build in any way you wish. As a
   simple example, suppose that you want to print a reminder to the user
   whenever a specific program is built. You can do this by checking for
   the target in the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS list:
        if 'bar' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
            print "Don't forget to copy `bar' to the archive!"
        Default(Program('foo.c'))
        Program('bar.c')

   Then, running SCons with the default target works as it always does,
   but explicity specifying the bar target on the command line generates
   the warning message:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
        cc -o foo foo.o
        % scons -Q bar
        Don't forget to copy `bar' to the archive!
        cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
        cc -o bar bar.o

   Another practical use for the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable might be to
   speed up a build by only reading certain subsidiary SConscript files if
   a specific target is requested.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.3.2. Controlling the Default Targets: the Default Function

   One of the most basic things you can control is which targets SCons
   will build by default--that is, when there are no targets specified on
   the command line. As mentioned previously, SCons will normally build
   every target in or below the current directory by default--that is,
   when you don't explicitly specify one or more targets on the command
   line. Sometimes, however, you may want to specify explicitly that only
   certain programs, or programs in certain directories, should be built
   by default. You do this with the Default function:
         env = Environment()
         hello = env.Program('hello.c')
         env.Program('goodbye.c')
         Default(hello)

   This SConstruct file knows how to build two programs, hello and
   goodbye, but only builds the hello program by default:
         % scons -Q
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o
         % scons -Q
         scons: `hello' is up to date.
         % scons -Q goodbye
         cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
         cc -o goodbye goodbye.o

   Note that, even when you use the Default function in your SConstruct
   file, you can still explicitly specify the current directory (.) on the
   command line to tell SCons to build everything in (or below) the
   current directory:
         % scons -Q .
         cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
         cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
         cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
         cc -o hello hello.o

   You can also call the Default function more than once, in which case
   each call adds to the list of targets to be built by default:
         env = Environment()
         prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
         Default(prog1)
         prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
         prog3 = env.Program('prog3.c')
         Default(prog3)

   Or you can specify more than one target in a single call to the Default
   function:
         env = Environment()
         prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
         prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
         prog3 = env.Program('prog3.c')
         Default(prog1, prog3)

   Either of these last two examples will build only the prog1 and prog3
   programs by default:
         % scons -Q
         cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
         cc -o prog1 prog1.o
         cc -o prog3.o -c prog3.c
         cc -o prog3 prog3.o
         % scons -Q .
         cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
         cc -o prog2 prog2.o

   You can list a directory as an argument to Default:
         env = Environment()
         env.Program(['prog1/main.c', 'prog1/foo.c'])
         env.Program(['prog2/main.c', 'prog2/bar.c'])
         Default('prog1')

   In which case only the target(s) in that directory will be built by
   default:
         % scons -Q
         cc -o prog1/foo.o -c prog1/foo.c
         cc -o prog1/main.o -c prog1/main.c
         cc -o prog1/main prog1/main.o prog1/foo.o
         % scons -Q
         scons: `prog1' is up to date.
         % scons -Q .
         cc -o prog2/bar.o -c prog2/bar.c
         cc -o prog2/main.o -c prog2/main.c
         cc -o prog2/main prog2/main.o prog2/bar.o

   Lastly, if for some reason you don't want any targets built by default,
   you can use the Python None variable:
         env = Environment()
         prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
         prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
         Default(None)

   Which would produce build output like:
         % scons -Q
         scons: *** No targets specified and no Default() targets found.  Stop.
         % scons -Q .
         cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
         cc -o prog1 prog1.o
         cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
         cc -o prog2 prog2.o
     __________________________________________________________________

12.3.2.1. Fetching the List of Default Targets: the DEFAULT_TARGETS Variable

   SCons supports a DEFAULT_TARGETS variable that lets you get at the
   current list of default targets. The DEFAULT_TARGETS variable has two
   important differences from the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable. First,
   the DEFAULT_TARGETS variable is a list of internal SCons nodes, so you
   need to convert the list elements to strings if you want to print them
   or look for a specific target name. Fortunately, you can do this easily
   by using the Python map function to run the list through str:
           prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
           Default(prog1)
           print "DEFAULT_TARGETS is", map(str, DEFAULT_TARGETS)

   (Keep in mind that all of the manipulation of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list
   takes place during the first phase when SCons is reading up the
   SConscript files, which is obvious if we leave off the -Q flag when we
   run SCons:)
           % scons
           scons: Reading SConscript files ...
           DEFAULT_TARGETS is ['prog1']
           scons: done reading SConscript files.
           scons: Building targets ...
           cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
           cc -o prog1 prog1.o
           scons: done building targets.

   Second, the contents of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list change in response to
   calls to the Default: function, as you can see from the following
   SConstruct file:
           prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
           Default(prog1)
           print "DEFAULT_TARGETS is now", map(str, DEFAULT_TARGETS)
           prog2 = Program('prog2.c')
           Default(prog2)
           print "DEFAULT_TARGETS is now", map(str, DEFAULT_TARGETS)

   Which yields the output:
           % scons
           scons: Reading SConscript files ...
           DEFAULT_TARGETS is now ['prog1']
           DEFAULT_TARGETS is now ['prog1', 'prog2']
           scons: done reading SConscript files.
           scons: Building targets ...
           cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
           cc -o prog1 prog1.o
           cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
           cc -o prog2 prog2.o
           scons: done building targets.

   In practice, this simply means that you need to pay attention to the
   order in which you call the Default function and refer to the
   DEFAULT_TARGETS list, to make sure that you don't examine the list
   before you've added the default targets you expect to find in it.
     __________________________________________________________________

12.3.3. Fetching the List of Build Targets, Regardless of Origin: the
BUILD_TARGETS Variable

   We've already been introduced to the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable,
   which contains a list of targets specified on the command line, and the
   DEFAULT_TARGETS variable, which contains a list of targets specified
   via calls to the Default method or function. Sometimes, however, you
   want a list of whatever targets SCons will try to build, regardless of
   whether the targets came from the command line or a Default call. You
   could code this up by hand, as follows:
        if COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
            targets = COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS
        else:
            targets = DEFAULT_TARGETS

   SCons, however, provides a convenient BUILD_TARGETS variable that
   eliminates the need for this by-hand manipulation. Essentially, the
   BUILD_TARGETS variable contains a list of the command-line targets, if
   any were specified, and if no command-line targets were specified, it
   contains a list of the targets specified via the Default method or
   function.

   Because BUILD_TARGETS may contain a list of SCons nodes, you must
   convert the list elements to strings if you want to print them or look
   for a specific target name, just like the DEFAULT_TARGETS list:
        prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
        Program('prog2.c')
        Default(prog1)
        print "BUILD_TARGETS is", map(str, BUILD_TARGETS)

   Notice how the value of BUILD_TARGETS changes depending on whether a
   target is specified on the command line:
        % scons -Q
        BUILD_TARGETS is ['prog1']
        cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
        cc -o prog1 prog1.o
        % scons -Q prog2
        BUILD_TARGETS is ['prog2']
        cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
        cc -o prog2 prog2.o
        % scons -Q -c .
        BUILD_TARGETS is ['.']
        Removed prog1.o
        Removed prog1
        Removed prog2.o
        Removed prog2
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 13. Installing Files in Other Directories: the Install Builder

   Once a program is built, it is often appropriate to install it in
   another directory for public use. You use the Install method to arrange
   for a program, or any other file, to be copied into a destination
   directory:
     env = Environment()
     hello = env.Program('hello.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)

   Note, however, that installing a file is still considered a type of
   file "build." This is important when you remember that the default
   behavior of SCons is to build files in or below the current directory.
   If, as in the example above, you are installing files in a directory
   outside of the top-level SConstruct file's directory tree, you must
   specify that directory (or a higher directory, such as /) for it to
   install anything there:
     % scons -Q
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     % scons -Q /usr/bin
     Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

   It can, however, be cumbersome to remember (and type) the specific
   destination directory in which the program (or any other file) should
   be installed. This is an area where the Alias function comes in handy,
   allowing you, for example, to create a pseudo-target named install that
   can expand to the specified destination directory:
     env = Environment()
     hello = env.Program('hello.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
     env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   This then yields the more natural ability to install the program in its
   destination as follows:
     % scons -Q
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     % scons -Q install
     Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"
     __________________________________________________________________

13.1. Installing Multiple Files in a Directory

   You can install multiple files into a directory simply by calling the
   Install function multiple times:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
       env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
       env.Install('/usr/bin', goodbye)
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   Or, more succinctly, listing the multiple input files in a list (just
   like you can do with any other builder):
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
       env.Install('/usr/bin', [hello, goodbye])
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   Either of these two examples yields:
       % scons -Q install
       cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
       cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
       Install file: "goodbye" as "/usr/bin/goodbye"
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"
     __________________________________________________________________

13.2. Installing a File Under a Different Name

   The Install method preserves the name of the file when it is copied
   into the destination directory. If you need to change the name of the
   file when you copy it, use the InstallAs function:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       env.InstallAs('/usr/bin/hello-new', hello)
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   This installs the hello program with the name hello-new as follows:
       % scons -Q install
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello-new"
     __________________________________________________________________

13.3. Installing Multiple Files Under Different Names

   Lastly, if you have multiple files that all need to be installed with
   different file names, you can either call the InstallAs function
   multiple times, or as a shorthand, you can supply same-length lists for
   both the target and source arguments:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
       env.InstallAs(['/usr/bin/hello-new',
                      '/usr/bin/goodbye-new'],
                     [hello, goodbye])
       env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   In this case, the InstallAs function loops through both lists
   simultaneously, and copies each source file into its corresponding
   target file name:
       % scons -Q install
       cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
       cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
       Install file: "goodbye" as "/usr/bin/goodbye-new"
       cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
       cc -o hello hello.o
       Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello-new"
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 14. Platform-Independent File System Manipulation

   SCons provides a number of platform-independent functions, called
   factories, that perform common file system manipulations like copying,
   moving or deleting files and directories, or making directories. These
   functions are factories because they don't perform the action at the
   time they're called, they each return an Action object that can be
   executed at the appropriate time.
     __________________________________________________________________

14.1. Copying Files or Directories: The Copy Factory

   Suppose you want to arrange to make a copy of a file, and don't have a
   suitable pre-existing builder. [279][4] One way would be to use the
   Copy action factory in conjunction with the Command builder:
        Command("file.out", "file.in", Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"))

   Notice that the action returned by the Copy factory will expand the
   [280]$TARGET and [281]$SOURCE strings at the time file.out is built,
   and that the order of the arguments is the same as that of a builder
   itself--that is, target first, followed by source:
       % scons -Q
       Copy("file.out", "file.in")

   You can, of course, name a file explicitly instead of using $TARGET or
   $SOURCE:
      Command("file.out", [], Copy("$TARGET", "file.in"))

   Which executes as:
      % scons -Q
      Copy("file.out", "file.in")

   The usefulness of the Copy factory becomes more apparent when you use
   it in a list of actions passed to the Command builder. For example,
   suppose you needed to run a file through a utility that only modifies
   files in-place, and can't "pipe" input to output. One solution is to
   copy the source file to a temporary file name, run the utility, and
   then copy the modified temporary file to the target, which the Copy
   factory makes extremely easy:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
                "modify tempfile",
                Copy("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
              ])

   The output then looks like:
      % scons -Q
      Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
      modify tempfile
      Copy("file.out", "tempfile")
     __________________________________________________________________

14.2. Deleting Files or Directories: The Delete Factory

   If you need to delete a file, then the Delete factory can be used in
   much the same way as the Copy factory. For example, if we want to make
   sure that the temporary file in our last example doesn't exist before
   we copy to it, we could add Delete to the beginning of the command
   list:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Delete("tempfile"),
                Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
                "modify tempfile",
                Copy("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
              ])

   Which then executes as follows:
      % scons -Q
      Delete("tempfile")
      Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
      modify tempfile
      Copy("file.out", "tempfile")

   Of course, like all of these Action factories, the Delete factory also
   expands [282]$TARGET and [283]$SOURCE variables appropriately. For
   example:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Delete("$TARGET"),
                Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE")
              ])

   Executes as:
      % scons -Q
      Delete("file.out")
      Copy("file.out", "file.in")

   Note, however, that you typically don't need to call the Delete factory
   explicitly in this way; by default, SCons deletes its target(s) for you
   before executing any action.

   One word of caution about using the Delete factory: it has the same
   variable expansions available as any other factory, including the
   $SOURCE variable. Specifying Delete("$SOURCE") is not something you
   usually want to do!
     __________________________________________________________________

14.3. Moving (Renaming) Files or Directories: The Move Factory

   The Move factory allows you to rename a file or directory. For example,
   if we don't want to copy the temporary file, we could use:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
                "modify tempfile",
                Move("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
              ])

   Which would execute as:
      % scons -Q
      Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
      modify tempfile
      Move("file.out", "tempfile")
     __________________________________________________________________

14.4. Updating the Modification Time of a File: The Touch Factory

   If you just need to update the recorded modification time for a file,
   use the Touch factory:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"),
                Touch("$TARGET"),
              ])

   Which executes as:
      % scons -Q
      Copy("file.out", "file.in")
      Touch("file.out")
     __________________________________________________________________

14.5. Creating a Directory: The Mkdir Factory

   If you need to create a directory, use the Mkdir factory. For example,
   if we need to process a file in a temporary directory in which the
   processing tool will create other files that we don't care about, you
   could use:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Delete("tempdir"),
                Mkdir("tempdir"),
                Copy("tempdir/${SOURCE.file}", "$SOURCE"),
                "process tempdir",
                Move("$TARGET", "tempdir/output_file"),
                Delete("tempdir"),
              ])

   Which executes as:
      % scons -Q
      Delete("tempdir")
      Mkdir("tempdir")
      Copy("tempdir/file.in", "file.in")
      process tempdir
      Move("file.out", "tempdir/output_file")
      scons: *** [file.out] tempdir/output_file: No such file or directory
     __________________________________________________________________

14.6. Changing File or Directory Permissions: The Chmod Factory

   To change permissions on a file or directory, use the Chmod factory.
   The permission argument uses POSIX-style permission bits and should
   typically be expressed as an octal, not decimal, number:
      Command("file.out", "file.in",
              [
                Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"),
                Chmod("$TARGET", 0755),
              ])

   Which executes:
      % scons -Q
      Copy("file.out", "file.in")
      Chmod("file.out", 0755)
     __________________________________________________________________

14.7. Executing an action immediately: the Execute Function

   We've been showing you how to use Action factories in the Command
   function. You can also execute an Action returned by a factory (or
   actually, any Action) at the time the SConscript file is read by using
   the Execute function. For example, if we need to make sure that a
   directory exists before we build any targets,
      Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/my_temp_directory'))

   Notice that this will create the directory while the SConscript file is
   being read:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      Mkdir("/tmp/my_temp_directory")
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      scons: `.' is up to date.
      scons: done building targets.

   If you're familiar with Python, you may wonder why you would want to
   use this instead of just calling the native Python os.mkdir() function.
   The advantage here is that the Mkdir action will behave appropriately
   if the user specifies the SCons -n or -q options--that is, it will
   print the action but not actually make the directory when -n is
   specified, or make the directory but not print the action when -q is
   specified.

   The Execute function returns the exit status or return value of the
   underlying action being executed. It will also print an error message
   if the action fails and returns a non-zero value. SCons will not,
   however, actually stop the build if the action fails. If you want the
   build to stop in response to a failure in an action called by Execute,
   you must do so by explicitly checking the return value and calling the
   Exit function (or a Python equivalent):
    if Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/my_temp_directory')):
        # A problem occurred while making the temp directory.
        Exit(1)
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 15. Controlling Removal of Targets

   There are two occasions when SCons will, by default, remove target
   files. The first is when SCons determines that an target file needs to
   be rebuilt and removes the existing version of the target before
   executing The second is when SCons is invoked with the -c option to
   "clean" a tree of its built targets. These behaviours can be suppressed
   with the Precious and NoClean functions, respectively.
     __________________________________________________________________

15.1. Preventing target removal during build: the Precious Function

   By default, SCons removes targets before building them. Sometimes,
   however, this is not what you want. For example, you may want to update
   a library incrementally, not by having it deleted and then rebuilt from
   all of the constituent object files. In such cases, you can use the
   Precious method to prevent SCons from removing the target before it is
   built:
        env = Environment(RANLIBCOM='')
        lib = env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
        env.Precious(lib)

   Although the output doesn't look any different, SCons does not, in
   fact, delete the target library before rebuilding it:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
        cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
        cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
        ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o

   SCons will, however, still delete files marked as Precious when the -c
   option is used.
     __________________________________________________________________

15.2. Preventing target removal during clean: the NoClean Function

   By default, SCons removes all built targets when invoked with the -c
   option to clean a source tree of built targets. Sometimes, however,
   this is not what you want. For example, you may want to remove only
   intermediate generated files (such as object files), but leave the
   final targets (the libraries) untouched. In such cases, you can use the
   NoClean method to prevent SCons from removing a target during a clean:
        env = Environment(RANLIBCOM='')
        lib = env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
        env.NoClean(lib)

   Notice that the libfoo.a is not listed as a removed file:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
        cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
        cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
        ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
        % scons -c
        scons: Reading SConscript files ...
        scons: done reading SConscript files.
        scons: Cleaning targets ...
        Removed f1.o
        Removed f2.o
        Removed f3.o
        scons: done cleaning targets.
     __________________________________________________________________

15.3. Removing additional files during clean: the Clean Function

   There may be additional files that you want removed when the -c option
   is used, but which SCons doesn't know about because they're not normal
   target files. For example, perhaps a command you invoke creates a log
   file as part of building the target file you want. You would like the
   log file cleaned, but you don't want to have to teach SCons that the
   command "builds" two files.

   You can use the Clean function to arrange for additional files to be
   removed when the -c option is used. Notice, however, that the Clean
   function takes two arguments, and the second argument is the name of
   the additional file you want cleaned (foo.log in this example):
        t = Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', 'build -o $TARGET $SOURCE')
        Clean(t, 'foo.log')

   The first argument is the target with which you want the cleaning of
   this additional file associated. In the above example, we've used the
   return value from the Command function, which represents the foo.out
   target. Now whenever the foo.out target is cleaned by the -c option,
   the foo.log file will be removed as well:
        % scons -Q
        build -o foo.out foo.in
        % scons -Q -c
        Removed foo.out
        Removed foo.log
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 16. Hierarchical Builds

   The source code for large software projects rarely stays in a single
   directory, but is nearly always divided into a hierarchy of
   directories. Organizing a large software build using SCons involves
   creating a hierarchy of build scripts using the SConscript function.
     __________________________________________________________________

16.1. SConscript Files

   As we've already seen, the build script at the top of the tree is
   called SConstruct. The top-level SConstruct file can use the SConscript
   function to include other subsidiary scripts in the build. These
   subsidiary scripts can, in turn, use the SConscript function to include
   still other scripts in the build. By convention, these subsidiary
   scripts are usually named SConscript. For example, a top-level
   SConstruct file might arrange for four subsidiary scripts to be
   included in the build as follows:
      SConscript(['drivers/display/SConscript',
                  'drivers/mouse/SConscript',
                  'parser/SConscript',
                  'utilities/SConscript'])

   In this case, the SConstruct file lists all of the SConscript files in
   the build explicitly. (Note, however, that not every directory in the
   tree necessarily has an SConscript file.) Alternatively, the drivers
   subdirectory might contain an intermediate SConscript file, in which
   case the SConscript call in the top-level SConstruct file would look
   like:
      SConscript(['drivers/SConscript',
                  'parser/SConscript',
                  'utilities/SConscript'])

   And the subsidiary SConscript file in the drivers subdirectory would
   look like:
      SConscript(['display/SConscript',
                  'mouse/SConscript'])

   Whether you list all of the SConscript files in the top-level
   SConstruct file, or place a subsidiary SConscript file in intervening
   directories, or use some mix of the two schemes, is up to you and the
   needs of your software.
     __________________________________________________________________

16.2. Path Names Are Relative to the SConscript Directory

   Subsidiary SConscript files make it easy to create a build hierarchy
   because all of the file and directory names in a subsidiary SConscript
   files are interpreted relative to the directory in which the SConscript
   file lives. Typically, this allows the SConscript file containing the
   instructions to build a target file to live in the same directory as
   the source files from which the target will be built, making it easy to
   update how the software is built whenever files are added or deleted
   (or other changes are made).

   For example, suppose we want to build two programs prog1 and prog2 in
   two separate directories with the same names as the programs. One
   typical way to do this would be with a top-level SConstruct file like
   this:
      SConscript(['prog1/SConscript',
                  'prog2/SConscript'])

   And subsidiary SConscript files that look like this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('prog1', ['main.c', 'foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   And this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('prog2', ['main.c', 'bar1.c', 'bar2.c'])

   Then, when we run SCons in the top-level directory, our build looks
   like:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o prog1/foo1.o -c prog1/foo1.c
       cc -o prog1/foo2.o -c prog1/foo2.c
       cc -o prog1/main.o -c prog1/main.c
       cc -o prog1/prog1 prog1/main.o prog1/foo1.o prog1/foo2.o
       cc -o prog2/bar1.o -c prog2/bar1.c
       cc -o prog2/bar2.o -c prog2/bar2.c
       cc -o prog2/main.o -c prog2/main.c
       cc -o prog2/prog2 prog2/main.o prog2/bar1.o prog2/bar2.o

   Notice the following: First, you can have files with the same names in
   multiple directories, like main.c in the above example. Second, unlike
   standard recursive use of Make, SCons stays in the top-level directory
   (where the SConstruct file lives) and issues commands that use the path
   names from the top-level directory to the target and source files
   within the hierarchy.
     __________________________________________________________________

16.3. Top-Level Path Names in Subsidiary SConscript Files

   If you need to use a file from another directory, it's sometimes more
   convenient to specify the path to a file in another directory from the
   top-level SConstruct directory, even when you're using that file in a
   subsidiary SConscript file in a subdirectory. You can tell SCons to
   interpret a path name as relative to the top-level SConstruct
   directory, not the local directory of the SConscript file, by appending
   a # (hash mark) to the beginning of the path name:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program('prog', ['main.c', '#lib/foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   In this example, the lib directory is directly underneath the top-level
   SConstruct directory. If the above SConscript file is in a subdirectory
   named src/prog, the output would look like:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o lib/foo1.o -c lib/foo1.c
       cc -o src/prog/foo2.o -c src/prog/foo2.c
       cc -o src/prog/main.o -c src/prog/main.c
       cc -o src/prog/prog src/prog/main.o lib/foo1.o src/prog/foo2.o

   (Notice that the lib/foo1.o object file is built in the same directory
   as its source file. See [284]Chapter 17, below, for information about
   how to build the object file in a different subdirectory.)
     __________________________________________________________________

16.4. Absolute Path Names

   Of course, you can always specify an absolute path name for a file--for
   example:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program('prog', ['main.c', '/usr/joe/lib/foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   Which, when executed, would yield:
       % scons -Q
       cc -o src/prog/foo2.o -c src/prog/foo2.c
       cc -o src/prog/main.o -c src/prog/main.c
       cc -o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o -c /usr/joe/lib/foo1.c
       cc -o src/prog/prog src/prog/main.o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o src/prog/foo2.o

   (As was the case with top-relative path names, notice that the
   /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o object file is built in the same directory as its
   source file. See [285]Chapter 17, below, for information about how to
   build the object file in a different subdirectory.)
     __________________________________________________________________

16.5. Sharing Environments (and Other Variables) Between SConscript Files

   In the previous example, each of the subsidiary SConscript files
   created its own construction environment by calling Environment
   separately. This obviously works fine, but if each program must be
   built with the same construction variables, it's cumbersome and
   error-prone to initialize separate construction environments in the
   same way over and over in each subsidiary SConscript file.

   SCons supports the ability to export variables from a parent SConscript
   file to its subsidiary SConscript files, which allows you to share
   common initialized values throughout your build hierarchy.
     __________________________________________________________________

16.5.1. Exporting Variables

   There are two ways to export a variable, such as a construction
   environment, from an SConscript file, so that it may be used by other
   SConscript files. First, you can call the Export function with a list
   of variables, or a string of white-space separated variable names. Each
   call to Export adds one or more variables to a global list of variables
   that are available for import by other SConscript files.
        env = Environment()
        Export('env')

   You may export more than one variable name at a time:
        env = Environment()
        debug = ARGUMENTS['debug']
        Export('env', 'debug')

   Because white space is not legal in Python variable names, the Export
   function will even automatically split a string into separate names for
   you:
        Export('env debug')

   Second, you can specify a list of variables to export as a second
   argument to the SConscript function call:
        SConscript('src/SConscript', 'env')

   Or as the exports keyword argument:
        SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='env')

   These calls export the specified variables to only the listed
   SConscript files. You may, however, specify more than one SConscript
   file in a list:
        SConscript(['src1/SConscript',
                    'src2/SConscript'], exports='env')

   This is functionally equivalent to calling the SConscript function
   multiple times with the same exports argument, one per SConscript file.
     __________________________________________________________________

16.5.2. Importing Variables

   Once a variable has been exported from a calling SConscript file, it
   may be used in other SConscript files by calling the Import function:
        Import('env')
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   The Import call makes the env construction environment available to the
   SConscript file, after which the variable can be used to build
   programs, libraries, etc.

   Like the Export function, the Import function can be used with multiple
   variable names:
        Import('env', 'debug')
        env = env.Clone(DEBUG = debug)
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   And the Import function will similarly split a string along white-space
   into separate variable names:
        Import('env debug')
        env = env.Clone(DEBUG = debug)
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   Lastly, as a special case, you may import all of the variables that
   have been exported by supplying an asterisk to the Import function:
        Import('*')
        env = env.Clone(DEBUG = debug)
        env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   If you're dealing with a lot of SConscript files, this can be a lot
   simpler than keeping arbitrary lists of imported variables in each
   file.
     __________________________________________________________________

16.5.3. Returning Values From an SConscript File

   Sometimes, you would like to be able to use information from a
   subsidiary SConscript file in some way. For example, suppose that you
   want to create one library from source files scattered throughout a
   number of subsidiary SConscript files. You can do this by using the
   Return function to return values from the subsidiary SConscript files
   to the calling file.

   If, for example, we have two subdirectories foo and bar that should
   each contribute a source file to a Library, what we'd like to be able
   to do is collect the object files from the subsidiary SConscript calls
   like this:
          env = Environment()
          Export('env')
          objs = []
          for subdir in ['foo', 'bar']:
              o = SConscript('%s/SConscript' % subdir)
              objs.append(o)
          env.Library('prog', objs)

   We can do this by using the Return function in the foo/SConscript file
   like this:
          Import('env')
          obj = env.Object('foo.c')
          Return('obj')

   (The corresponding bar/SConscript file should be pretty obvious.) Then
   when we run SCons, the object files from the subsidiary subdirectories
   are all correctly archived in the desired library:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o bar/bar.o -c bar/bar.c
        cc -o foo/foo.o -c foo/foo.c
        ar rc libprog.a foo/foo.o bar/bar.o
        ranlib libprog.a
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 17. Separating Source and Build Directories

   It's often useful to keep any built files completely separate from the
   source files. In SCons, this is usually done by creating one or more
   separate variant directory trees that are used to hold the built
   objects files, libraries, and executable programs, etc. for a specific
   flavor, or variant, of build. SCons provides two ways to do this, one
   through the SConscript function that we've already seen, and the second
   through a more flexible VariantDir function.

   One historical note: the VariantDir function used to be called
   BuildDir. That name is still supported but has been deprecated because
   the SCons functionality differs from the model of a "build directory"
   implemented by other build systems like the GNU Autotools.
     __________________________________________________________________

17.1. Specifying a Variant Directory Tree as Part of an SConscript Call

   The most straightforward way to establish a variant directory tree uses
   the fact that the usual way to set up a build hierarchy is to have an
   SConscript file in the source subdirectory. If you then pass a
   variant_dir argument to the SConscript function call:
      SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build')

   SCons will then build all of the files in the build subdirectory:
      % ls src
      SConscript  hello.c
      % scons -Q
      cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
      cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
      % ls build
      SConscript  hello  hello.c  hello.o

   But wait a minute--what's going on here? SCons created the object file
   build/hello.o in the build subdirectory, as expected. But even though
   our hello.c file lives in the src subdirectory, SCons has actually
   compiled a build/hello.c file to create the object file.

   What's happened is that SCons has duplicated the hello.c file from the
   src subdirectory to the build subdirectory, and built the program from
   there. The next section explains why SCons does this.
     __________________________________________________________________

17.2. Why SCons Duplicates Source Files in a Variant Directory Tree

   SCons duplicates source files in variant directory trees because it's
   the most straightforward way to guarantee a correct build regardless of
   include-file directory paths, relative references between files, or
   tool support for putting files in different locations, and the SCons
   philosophy is to, by default, guarantee a correct build in all cases.

   The most direct reason to duplicate source files in variant directories
   is simply that some tools (mostly older versions) are written to only
   build their output files in the same directory as the source files. In
   this case, the choices are either to build the output file in the
   source directory and move it to the variant directory, or to duplicate
   the source files in the variant directory.

   Additionally, relative references between files can cause problems if
   we don't just duplicate the hierarchy of source files in the variant
   directory. You can see this at work in use of the C preprocessor
   #include mechanism with double quotes, not angle brackets:
      #include "file.h"

   The de facto standard behavior for most C compilers in this case is to
   first look in the same directory as the source file that contains the
   #include line, then to look in the directories in the preprocessor
   search path. Add to this that the SCons implementation of support for
   code repositories (described below) means not all of the files will be
   found in the same directory hierarchy, and the simplest way to make
   sure that the right include file is found is to duplicate the source
   files into the variant directory, which provides a correct build
   regardless of the original location(s) of the source files.

   Although source-file duplication guarantees a correct build even in
   these end-cases, it can usually be safely disabled. The next section
   describes how you can disable the duplication of source files in the
   variant directory.
     __________________________________________________________________

17.3. Telling SCons to Not Duplicate Source Files in the Variant Directory
Tree

   In most cases and with most tool sets, SCons can place its target files
   in a build subdirectory without duplicating the source files and
   everything will work just fine. You can disable the default SCons
   behavior by specifying duplicate=0 when you call the SConscript
   function:
      SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build', duplicate=0)

   When this flag is specified, SCons uses the variant directory like most
   people expect--that is, the output files are placed in the variant
   directory while the source files stay in the source directory:
      % ls src
      SConscript
      hello.c
      % scons -Q
      cc -c src/hello.c -o build/hello.o
      cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
      % ls build
      hello
      hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

17.4. The VariantDir Function

   Use the VariantDir function to establish that target files should be
   built in a separate directory from the source files:
      VariantDir('build', 'src')
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('build/hello.c')

   Note that when you're not using an SConscript file in the src
   subdirectory, you must actually specify that the program must be built
   from the build/hello.c file that SCons will duplicate in the build
   subdirectory.

   When using the VariantDir function directly, SCons still duplicates the
   source files in the variant directory by default:
      % ls src
      hello.c
      % scons -Q
      cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
      cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
      % ls build
      hello  hello.c  hello.o

   You can specify the same duplicate=0 argument that you can specify for
   an SConscript call:
      VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=0)
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('build/hello.c')

   In which case SCons will disable duplication of the source files:
      % ls src
      hello.c
      % scons -Q
      cc -o build/hello.o -c src/hello.c
      cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
      % ls build
      hello  hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

17.5. Using VariantDir With an SConscript File

   Even when using the VariantDir function, it's much more natural to use
   it with a subsidiary SConscript file. For example, if the
   src/SConscript looks like this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('hello.c')

   Then our SConstruct file could look like:
      VariantDir('build', 'src')
      SConscript('build/SConscript')

   Yielding the following output:
      % ls src
      SConscript  hello.c
      % scons -Q
      cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
      cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
      % ls build
      SConscript  hello  hello.c  hello.o

   Notice that this is completely equivalent to the use of SConscript that
   we learned about in the previous section.
     __________________________________________________________________

17.6. Using Glob with VariantDir

   The Glob file name pattern matching function works just as usual when
   using VariantDir. For example, if the src/SConscript looks like this:
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('hello', Glob('*.c'))

   Then with the same SConstruct file as in the previous section, and
   source files f1.c and f2.c in src, we would see the following output:
      % ls src
      SConscript  f1.c  f2.c  f2.h
      % scons -Q
      cc -o build/f1.o -c build/f1.c
      cc -o build/f2.o -c build/f2.c
      cc -o build/hello build/f1.o build/f2.o
      % ls build
      SConscript  f1.c  f1.o  f2.c  f2.h  f2.o  hello

   The Glob function returns Nodes in the build/ tree, as you'd expect.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 18. Variant Builds

   The variant_dir keyword argument of the SConscript function provides
   everything we need to show how easy it is to create variant builds
   using SCons. Suppose, for example, that we want to build a program for
   both Windows and Linux platforms, but that we want to build it in a
   shared directory with separate side-by-side build directories for the
   Windows and Linux versions of the program.
    platform = ARGUMENTS.get('OS', Platform())

    include = "#export/$PLATFORM/include"
    lib = "#export/$PLATFORM/lib"
    bin = "#export/$PLATFORM/bin"

    env = Environment(PLATFORM = platform,
                      BINDIR = bin,
                      INCDIR = include,
                      LIBDIR = lib,
                      CPPPATH = [include],
                      LIBPATH = [lib],
                      LIBS = 'world')

    Export('env')

    env.SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/$PLATFORM')

   This SConstruct file, when run on a Linux system, yields:
    % scons -Q OS=linux
    Install file: "build/linux/world/world.h" as "export/linux/include/world.h"
    cc -o build/linux/hello/hello.o -c -Iexport/linux/include build/linux/hello/
hello.c
    cc -o build/linux/world/world.o -c -Iexport/linux/include build/linux/world/
world.c
    ar rc build/linux/world/libworld.a build/linux/world/world.o
    ranlib build/linux/world/libworld.a
    Install file: "build/linux/world/libworld.a" as "export/linux/lib/libworld.a
"
    cc -o build/linux/hello/hello build/linux/hello/hello.o -Lexport/linux/lib -
lworld
    Install file: "build/linux/hello/hello" as "export/linux/bin/hello"

   The same SConstruct file on Windows would build:
    C:\>scons -Q OS=windows
    Install file: "build/windows/world/world.h" as "export/windows/include/world
.h"
    cl /Fobuild\windows\hello\hello.obj /c build\windows\hello\hello.c /nologo /
Iexport\windows\include
    cl /Fobuild\windows\world\world.obj /c build\windows\world\world.c /nologo /
Iexport\windows\include
    lib /nologo /OUT:build\windows\world\world.lib build\windows\world\world.obj
    Install file: "build/windows/world/world.lib" as "export/windows/lib/world.l
ib"
    link /nologo /OUT:build\windows\hello\hello.exe /LIBPATH:export\windows\lib
world.lib build\windows\hello\hello.obj
    Install file: "build/windows/hello/hello.exe" as "export/windows/bin/hello.e
xe"
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 19. Writing Your Own Builders

   Although SCons provides many useful methods for building common
   software products: programs, libraries, documents. you frequently want
   to be able to build some other type of file not supported directly by
   SCons. Fortunately, SCons makes it very easy to define your own Builder
   objects for any custom file types you want to build. (In fact, the
   SCons interfaces for creating Builder objects are flexible enough and
   easy enough to use that all of the the SCons built-in Builder objects
   are created the mechanisms described in this section.)
     __________________________________________________________________

19.1. Writing Builders That Execute External Commands

   The simplest Builder to create is one that executes an external
   command. For example, if we want to build an output file by running the
   contents of the input file through a command named foobuild, creating
   that Builder might look like:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')

   All the above line does is create a free-standing Builder object. The
   next section will show us how to actually use it.
     __________________________________________________________________

19.2. Attaching a Builder to a Construction Environment

   A Builder object isn't useful until it's attached to a construction
   environment so that we can call it to arrange for files to be built.
   This is done through the [286]$BUILDERS construction variable in an
   environment. The $BUILDERS variable is a Python dictionary that maps
   the names by which you want to call various Builder objects to the
   objects themselves. For example, if we want to call the Builder we just
   defined by the name Foo, our SConstruct file might look like:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})

   With the Builder attached to our construction environment with the name
   Foo, we can now actually call it like so:
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')

   Then when we run SCons it looks like:
      % scons -Q
      foobuild < file.input > file.foo

   Note, however, that the default $BUILDERS variable in a construction
   environment comes with a default set of Builder objects already
   defined: [287]Program, [288]Library, etc. And when we explicitly set
   the $BUILDERS variable when we create the construction environment, the
   default Builders are no longer part of the environment:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
       env.Program('hello.c')

      % scons -Q
      AttributeError: 'SConsEnvironment' object has no attribute 'Program':
        File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 4:
          env.Program('hello.c')

   To be able to use both our own defined Builder objects and the default
   Builder objects in the same construction environment, you can either
   add to the $BUILDERS variable using the Append function:
       env = Environment()
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env.Append(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
       env.Program('hello.c')

   Or you can explicitly set the appropriately-named key in the $BUILDERS
   dictionary:
       env = Environment()
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
       env['BUILDERS']['Foo'] = bld
       env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
       env.Program('hello.c')

   Either way, the same construction environment can then use both the
   newly-defined Foo Builder and the default [289]Program Builder:
      % scons -Q
      foobuild < file.input > file.foo
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

19.3. Letting SCons Handle The File Suffixes

   By supplying additional information when you create a Builder, you can
   let SCons add appropriate file suffixes to the target and/or the source
   file. For example, rather than having to specify explicitly that you
   want the Foo Builder to build the file.foo target file from the
   file.input source file, you can give the .foo and .input suffixes to
   the Builder, making for more compact and readable calls to the Foo
   Builder:
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET',
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file1')
       env.Foo('file2')

      % scons -Q
      foobuild < file1.input > file1.foo
      foobuild < file2.input > file2.foo

   You can also supply a prefix keyword argument if it's appropriate to
   have SCons append a prefix to the beginning of target file names.
     __________________________________________________________________

19.4. Builders That Execute Python Functions

   In SCons, you don't have to call an external command to build a file.
   You can, instead, define a Python function that a Builder object can
   invoke to build your target file (or files). Such a builder function
   definition looks like:
       def build_function(target, source, env):
           # Code to build "target" from "source"
           return None

   The arguments of a builder function are:

   target
          A list of Node objects representing the target or targets to be
          built by this builder function. The file names of these
          target(s) may be extracted using the Python str function.

   source
          A list of Node objects representing the sources to be used by
          this builder function to build the targets. The file names of
          these source(s) may be extracted using the Python str function.

   env
          The construction environment used for building the target(s).
          The builder function may use any of the environment's
          construction variables in any way to affect how it builds the
          targets.

   The builder function must return a 0 or None value if the target(s) are
   built successfully. The builder function may raise an exception or
   return any non-zero value to indicate that the build is unsuccessful,

   Once you've defined the Python function that will build your target
   file, defining a Builder object for it is as simple as specifying the
   name of the function, instead of an external command, as the Builder's
   action argument:
       def build_function(target, source, env):
           # Code to build "target" from "source"
           return None
       bld = Builder(action = build_function,
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file')

   And notice that the output changes slightly, reflecting the fact that a
   Python function, not an external command, is now called to build the
   target file:
      % scons -Q
      build_function(["file.foo"], ["file.input"])
     __________________________________________________________________

19.5. Builders That Create Actions Using a Generator

   SCons Builder objects can create an action "on the fly" by using a
   function called a generator. This provides a great deal of flexibility
   to construct just the right list of commands to build your target. A
   generator looks like:
       def generate_actions(source, target, env, for_signature):
           return 'foobuild < %s > %s' % (target[0], source[0])

   The arguments of a generator are:

   source
          A list of Node objects representing the sources to be built by
          the command or other action generated by this function. The file
          names of these source(s) may be extracted using the Python str
          function.

   target
          A list of Node objects representing the target or targets to be
          built by the command or other action generated by this function.
          The file names of these target(s) may be extracted using the
          Python str function.

   env
          The construction environment used for building the target(s).
          The generator may use any of the environment's construction
          variables in any way to determine what command or other action
          to return.

   for_signature
          A flag that specifies whether the generator is being called to
          contribute to a build signature, as opposed to actually
          executing the command.

   The generator must return a command string or other action that will be
   used to build the specified target(s) from the specified source(s).

   Once you've defined a generator, you create a Builder to use it by
   specifying the generator keyword argument instead of action.
       def generate_actions(source, target, env, for_signature):
           return 'foobuild < %s > %s' % (source[0], target[0])
       bld = Builder(generator = generate_actions,
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input')
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file')

      % scons -Q
      foobuild < file.input > file.foo

   Note that it's illegal to specify both an action and a generator for a
   Builder.
     __________________________________________________________________

19.6. Builders That Modify the Target or Source Lists Using an Emitter

   SCons supports the ability for a Builder to modify the lists of
   target(s) from the specified source(s). You do this by defining an
   emitter function that takes as its arguments the list of the targets
   passed to the builder, the list of the sources passed to the builder,
   and the construction environment. The emitter function should return
   the modified lists of targets that should be built and sources from
   which the targets will be built.

   For example, suppose you want to define a Builder that always calls a
   foobuild program, and you want to automatically add a new target file
   named new_target and a new source file named new_source whenever it's
   called. The SConstruct file might look like this:
       def modify_targets(target, source, env):
           target.append('new_target')
           source.append('new_source')
           return target, source
       bld = Builder(action = 'foobuild $TARGETS - $SOURCES',
                     suffix = '.foo',
                     src_suffix = '.input',
                     emitter = modify_targets)
       env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld})
       env.Foo('file')

   And would yield the following output:
      % scons -Q
      foobuild file.foo new_target - file.input new_source

   One very flexible thing that you can do is use a construction variable
   to specify different emitter functions for different construction
   variable. To do this, specify a string containing a construction
   variable expansion as the emitter when you call the Builder function,
   and set that construction variable to the desired emitter function in
   different construction environments:
        bld = Builder(action = 'my_command $SOURCES > $TARGET',
                      suffix = '.foo',
                      src_suffix = '.input',
                      emitter = '$MY_EMITTER')
        def modify1(target, source, env):
            return target, source + ['modify1.in']
        def modify2(target, source, env):
            return target, source + ['modify2.in']
        env1 = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld},
                           MY_EMITTER = modify1)
        env2 = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld},
                           MY_EMITTER = modify2)
        env1.Foo('file1')
        env2.Foo('file2')
        import os
        env1['ENV']['PATH'] = env2['ENV']['PATH'] + os.pathsep + os.getcwd()
        env2['ENV']['PATH'] = env2['ENV']['PATH'] + os.pathsep + os.getcwd()



      bld = Builder(action = 'my_command $SOURCES > $TARGET',
                    suffix = '.foo',
                    src_suffix = '.input',
                    emitter = '$MY_EMITTER')
      def modify1(target, source, env):
          return target, source + ['modify1.in']
      def modify2(target, source, env):
          return target, source + ['modify2.in']
      env1 = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld},
                         MY_EMITTER = modify1)
      env2 = Environment(BUILDERS = {'Foo' : bld},
                         MY_EMITTER = modify2)
      env1.Foo('file1')
      env2.Foo('file2')


   In this example, the modify1.in and modify2.in files get added to the
   source lists of the different commands:
      % scons -Q
      my_command file1.input modify1.in > file1.foo
      my_command file2.input modify2.in > file2.foo
     __________________________________________________________________

19.7. Where To Put Your Custom Builders and Tools

   The site_scons directory gives you a place to put Python modules you
   can import into your SConscript files (site_scons), add-on tools that
   can integrate into SCons (site_scons/site_tools), and a
   site_scons/site_init.py file that gets read before any SConstruct or
   SConscript file, allowing you to change SCons's default behavior.

   If you get a tool from somewhere (the SCons wiki or a third party, for
   instance) and you'd like to use it in your project, the site_scons dir
   is the simplest place to put it. Tools come in two flavors; either a
   Python function that operates on an Environment or a Python file
   containing two functions, exists() and generate().

   A single-function Tool can just be included in your
   site_scons/site_init.py file where it will be parsed and made available
   for use. For instance, you could have a site_scons/site_init.py file
   like this:
        def TOOL_ADD_HEADER(env):
           """A Tool to add a header from $HEADER to the source file"""
           add_header = Builder(action=['echo "$HEADER" > $TARGET',
                                        'cat $SOURCE >> $TARGET'])
           env.Append(BUILDERS = {'AddHeader' : add_header})
           env['HEADER'] = '' # set default value

   and a SConstruct like this:
        # Use TOOL_ADD_HEADER from site_scons/site_init.py
        env=Environment(tools=['default', TOOL_ADD_HEADER], HEADER="=====")
        env.AddHeader('tgt', 'src')

   The TOOL_ADD_HEADER tool method will be called to add the AddHeader
   tool to the environment.

   Similarly, a more full-fledged tool with exists() and generate()
   methods can be installed in site_scons/site_tools/toolname.py. Since
   site_scons/site_tools is automatically added to the head of the tool
   search path, any tool found there will be available to all
   environments. Furthermore, a tool found there will override a built-in
   tool of the same name, so if you need to change the behavior of a
   built-in tool, site_scons gives you the hook you need.

   Many people have a library of utility Python functions they'd like to
   include in SConscripts; just put that module in site_scons/my_utils.py
   or any valid Python module name of your choice. For instance you can do
   something like this in site_scons/my_utils.py to add build_id and
   MakeWorkDir functions:
        from SCons.Script import *   # for Execute and Mkdir
        def build_id():
           """Return a build ID (stub version)"""
           return "100"
        def MakeWorkDir(workdir):
           """Create the specified dir immediately"""
           Execute(Mkdir(workdir))

   And then in your SConscript or any sub-SConscript anywhere in your
   build, you can import my_utils and use it:
        import my_utils
        print "build_id=" + my_utils.build_id()
        my_utils.MakeWorkDir('/tmp/work')

   Note that although you can put this library in site_scons/site_init.py,
   it is no better there than site_scons/my_utils.py since you still have
   to import that module into your SConscript. Also note that in order to
   refer to objects in the SCons namespace such as Environment or Mkdir or
   Execute in any file other than a SConstruct or SConscript you always
   need to do
        from SCons.Script import *

   This is true in modules in site_scons such as site_scons/site_init.py
   as well.

   If you have a machine-wide site dir you'd like to use instead of
   ./site_scons, use the --site-dir option to point to your dir.
   site_init.py and site_tools will be located under that dir. To avoid
   using a site_scons dir at all, even if it exists, use the --no-site-dir
   option.

Chapter 20. Not Writing a Builder: the Command Builder

   Creating a Builder and attaching it to a construction environment
   allows for a lot of flexibility when you want to re-use actions to
   build multiple files of the same type. This can, however, be cumbersome
   if you only need to execute one specific command to build a single file
   (or group of files). For these situations, SCons supports a Command
   Builder that arranges for a specific action to be executed to build a
   specific file or files. This looks a lot like the other builders (like
   [290]Program, [291]Object, etc.), but takes as an additional argument
   the command to be executed to build the file:
     env = Environment()
     env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', "sed 's/x/y/' < $SOURCE > $TARGET")

   When executed, SCons runs the specified command, substituting
   [292]$SOURCE and [293]$TARGET as expected:
    % scons -Q
    sed 's/x/y/' < foo.in > foo.out

   This is often more convenient than creating a Builder object and adding
   it to the [294]$BUILDERS variable of a construction environment

   Note that the action you specify to the Command Builder can be any
   legal SCons Action, such as a Python function:
     env = Environment()
     def build(target, source, env):
         # Whatever it takes to build
         return None
     env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', build)

   Which executes as follows:
    % scons -Q
    build(["foo.out"], ["foo.in"])

   Note that [295]$SOURCE and [296]$TARGET are expanded in the source and
   target as well as of SCons 1.1, so you can write:
     env.Command('${SOURCE.basename}.out', 'foo.in', build)

   which does the same thing as the previous example, but allows you to
   avoid repeating yourself.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 21. Pseudo-Builders: the AddMethod function

   The AddMethod function is used to add a method to an environment. It's
   typically used to add a "pseudo-builder," a function that looks like a
   Builder but wraps up calls to multiple other Builders or otherwise
   processes its arguments before calling one or more Builders. In the
   following example, we want to install the program into the standard
   /usr/bin directory hierarchy, but also copy it into a local install/bin
   directory from which a package might be built:
     def install_in_bin_dirs(env, source):
         """Install source in both bin dirs"""
         i1 = env.Install("$BIN", source)
         i2 = env.Install("$LOCALBIN", source)
         return [i1[0], i2[0]] # Return a list, like a normal builder
     env = Environment(BIN='/usr/bin', LOCALBIN='#install/bin')
     env.AddMethod(install_in_bin_dirs, "InstallInBinDirs")
     env.InstallInBinDirs(Program('hello.c')) # installs hello in both bin dirs


   This produces the following:
    % scons -Q /
    cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
    cc -o hello hello.o
    Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"
    Install file: "hello" as "install/bin/hello"

   As mentioned, a psuedo-builder also provides more flexibility in
   parsing arguments than you can get with a Builder. The next example
   shows a pseudo-builder with a named argument that modifies the
   filename, and a separate argument for the resource file (rather than
   having the builder figure it out by file extension). This example also
   demonstrates using the global AddMethod function to add a method to the
   global Environment class, so it will be used in all subsequently
   created environments.
     def BuildTestProg(env, testfile, resourcefile, testdir="tests"):
         """Build the test program;
         prepends "test_" to src and target,
         and puts target into testdir."""
         srcfile = "test_%s.c" % testfile
         target = "%s/test_%s" % (testdir, testfile)
         if env['PLATFORM'] == 'win32':
             resfile = env.RES(resourcefile)
             p = env.Program(target, [srcfile, resfile])
         else:
             p = env.Program(target, srcfile)
         return p
     AddMethod(Environment, BuildTestProg)

     env = Environment()
     env.BuildTestProg('stuff', resourcefile='res.rc')

   This produces the following on Linux:
    % scons -Q
    cc -o test_stuff.o -c test_stuff.c
    cc -o tests/test_stuff test_stuff.o

   And the following on Windows:
    C:\>scons -Q
    rc /fores.res res.rc
    cl /Fotest_stuff.obj /c test_stuff.c /nologo
    link /nologo /OUT:tests\test_stuff.exe test_stuff.obj res.res

   Using AddMethod is better than just adding an instance method to a
   construction environment because it gets called as a proper method, and
   because AddMethod provides for copying the method to any clones of the
   construction environment instance.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 22. Writing Scanners

   SCons has built-in scanners that know how to look in C, Fortran and IDL
   source files for information about other files that targets built from
   those files depend on--for example, in the case of files that use the C
   preprocessor, the .h files that are specified using #include lines in
   the source. You can use the same mechanisms that SCons uses to create
   its built-in scanners to write scanners of your own for file types that
   SCons does not know how to scan "out of the box."
     __________________________________________________________________

22.1. A Simple Scanner Example

   Suppose, for example, that we want to create a simple scanner for .foo
   files. A .foo file contains some text that will be processed, and can
   include other files on lines that begin with include followed by a file
   name:
      include filename.foo

   Scanning a file will be handled by a Python function that you must
   supply. Here is a function that will use the Python re module to scan
   for the include lines in our example:
      import re

      include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

      def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg):
          contents = node.get_text_contents()
          return include_re.findall(contents)

   The scanner function must accept the four specified arguments and
   return a list of implicit dependencies. Presumably, these would be
   dependencies found from examining the contents of the file, although
   the function can perform any manipulation at all to generate the list
   of dependencies.

   node
          An SCons node object representing the file being scanned. The
          path name to the file can be used by converting the node to a
          string using the str() function, or an internal SCons
          get_text_contents() object method can be used to fetch the
          contents.

   env
          The construction environment in effect for this scan. The
          scanner function may choose to use construction variables from
          this environment to affect its behavior.

   path
          A list of directories that form the search path for included
          files for this scanner. This is how SCons handles the
          [297]$CPPPATH and [298]$LIBPATH variables.

   arg
          An optional argument that you can choose to have passed to this
          scanner function by various scanner instances.

   A Scanner object is created using the Scanner function, which typically
   takes an skeys argument to associate the type of file suffix with this
   scanner. The Scanner object must then be associated with the
   [299]$SCANNERS construction variable of a construction environment,
   typically by using the Append method:
       kscan = Scanner(function = kfile_scan,
                       skeys = ['.k'])
       env.Append(SCANNERS = kscan)

   When we put it all together, it looks like:
        import re

        include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

        def kfile_scan(node, env, path):
            contents = node.get_text_contents()
            includes = include_re.findall(contents)
            return includes

        kscan = Scanner(function = kfile_scan,
                        skeys = ['.k'])

        env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : '/usr/local/bin'})
        env.Append(SCANNERS = kscan)

        env.Command('foo', 'foo.k', 'kprocess < $SOURCES > $TARGET')
     __________________________________________________________________

22.2. Adding a search path to a scanner: FindPathDirs

   Many scanners need to search for included files or dependencies using a
   path variable; this is how [300]$CPPPATH and [301]$LIBPATH work. The
   path to search is passed to your scanner as the path argument. Path
   variables may be lists of nodes, semicolon-separated strings, or even
   contain SCons variables which need to be expanded. Fortunately, SCons
   provides the FindPathDirs function which itself returns a function to
   expand a given path (given as a SCons construction variable name) to a
   list of paths at the time the scanner is called. Deferring evaluation
   until that point allows, for instance, the path to contain $TARGET
   references which differ for each file scanned.

   Using FindPathDirs is quite easy. Continuing the above example, using
   KPATH as the construction variable with the search path (analogous to
   [302]$CPPPATH), we just modify the Scanner constructor call to include
   a path keyword arg:
        kscan = Scanner(function = kfile_scan,
                        skeys = ['.k'],
                        path=FindPathDirs('KPATH'))

   FindPathDirs returns a callable object that, when called, will
   essentially expand the elements in env['KPATH'] and tell the scanner to
   search in those dirs. It will also properly add related repository and
   variant dirs to the search list. As a side note, the returned method
   stores the path in an efficient way so lookups are fast even when
   variable substitutions may be needed. This is important since many
   files get scanned in a typical build.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 23. Building From Code Repositories

   Often, a software project will have one or more central repositories,
   directory trees that contain source code, or derived files, or both.
   You can eliminate additional unnecessary rebuilds of files by having
   SCons use files from one or more code repositories to build files in
   your local build tree.
     __________________________________________________________________

23.1. The Repository Method

   It's often useful to allow multiple programmers working on a project to
   build software from source files and/or derived files that are stored
   in a centrally-accessible repository, a directory copy of the source
   code tree. (Note that this is not the sort of repository maintained by
   a source code management system like BitKeeper, CVS, or Subversion.)
   You use the Repository method to tell SCons to search one or more
   central code repositories (in order) for any source files and derived
   files that are not present in the local build tree:
       env = Environment()
       env.Program('hello.c')
       Repository('/usr/repository1', '/usr/repository2')

   Multiple calls to the Repository method will simply add repositories to
   the global list that SCons maintains, with the exception that SCons
   will automatically eliminate the current directory and any non-existent
   directories from the list.
     __________________________________________________________________

23.2. Finding source files in repositories

   The above example specifies that SCons will first search for files
   under the /usr/repository1 tree and next under the /usr/repository2
   tree. SCons expects that any files it searches for will be found in the
   same position relative to the top-level directory. In the above
   example, if the hello.c file is not found in the local build tree,
   SCons will search first for a /usr/repository1/hello.c file and then
   for a /usr/repository2/hello.c file to use in its place.

   So given the SConstruct file above, if the hello.c file exists in the
   local build directory, SCons will rebuild the hello program as normal:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   If, however, there is no local hello.c file, but one exists in
   /usr/repository1, SCons will recompile the hello program from the
   source file it finds in the repository:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c /usr/repository1/hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   And similarly, if there is no local hello.c file and no
   /usr/repository1/hello.c, but one exists in /usr/repository2:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c /usr/repository2/hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

23.3. Finding #include files in repositories

   We've already seen that SCons will scan the contents of a source file
   for #include file names and realize that targets built from that source
   file also depend on the #include file(s). For each directory in the
   [303]$CPPPATH list, SCons will actually search the corresponding
   directories in any repository trees and establish the correct
   dependencies on any #include files that it finds in repository
   directory.

   Unless the C compiler also knows about these directories in the
   repository trees, though, it will be unable to find the #include files.
   If, for example, the hello.c file in our previous example includes the
   hello.h; in its current directory, and the hello.h; only exists in the
   repository:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      hello.c:1: hello.h: No such file or directory

   In order to inform the C compiler about the repositories, SCons will
   add appropriate -I flags to the compilation commands for each directory
   in the $CPPPATH list. So if we add the current directory to the
   construction environment $CPPPATH like so:
       env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
       env.Program('hello.c')
       Repository('/usr/repository1')

   Then re-executing SCons yields:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c -I. -I/usr/repository1 hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   The order of the -I options replicates, for the C preprocessor, the
   same repository-directory search path that SCons uses for its own
   dependency analysis. If there are multiple repositories and multiple
   $CPPPATH directories, SCons will add the repository directories to the
   beginning of each $CPPPATH directory, rapidly multiplying the number of
   -I flags. If, for example, the $CPPPATH contains three directories (and
   shorter repository path names!):
       env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['dir1', 'dir2', 'dir3'])
       env.Program('hello.c')
       Repository('/r1', '/r2')

   Then we'll end up with nine -I options on the command line, three (for
   each of the $CPPPATH directories) times three (for the local directory
   plus the two repositories):
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c -Idir1 -I/r1/dir1 -I/r2/dir1 -Idir2 -I/r1/dir2 -I/r2/dir2
 -Idir3 -I/r1/dir3 -I/r2/dir3 hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

23.3.1. Limitations on #include files in repositories

   SCons relies on the C compiler's -I options to control the order in
   which the preprocessor will search the repository directories for
   #include files. This causes a problem, however, with how the C
   preprocessor handles #include lines with the file name included in
   double-quotes.

   As we've seen, SCons will compile the hello.c file from the repository
   if it doesn't exist in the local directory. If, however, the hello.c
   file in the repository contains a #include line with the file name in
   double quotes:
        #include "hello.h"
        int
        main(int argc, char *argv[])
        {
            printf(HELLO_MESSAGE);
            return (0);
        }

   Then the C preprocessor will always use a hello.h file from the
   repository directory first, even if there is a hello.h file in the
   local directory, despite the fact that the command line specifies -I as
   the first option:
        % scons -Q
        cc -o hello.o -c -I. -I/usr/repository1 /usr/repository1/hello.c
        cc -o hello hello.o

   This behavior of the C preprocessor--always search for a #include file
   in double-quotes first in the same directory as the source file, and
   only then search the -I--can not, in general, be changed. In other
   words, it's a limitation that must be lived with if you want to use
   code repositories in this way. There are three ways you can possibly
   work around this C preprocessor behavior:

    1. Some modern versions of C compilers do have an option to disable or
       control this behavior. If so, add that option to [304]$CFLAGS (or
       [305]$CXXFLAGS or both) in your construction environment(s). Make
       sure the option is used for all construction environments that use
       C preprocessing!
    2. Change all occurrences of #include "file.h" to #include <file.h>.
       Use of #include with angle brackets does not have the same
       behavior--the -I directories are searched first for #include
       files--which gives SCons direct control over the list of
       directories the C preprocessor will search.
    3. Require that everyone working with compilation from repositories
       check out and work on entire directories of files, not individual
       files. (If you use local wrapper scripts around your source code
       control system's command, you could add logic to enforce this
       restriction there.
     __________________________________________________________________

23.4. Finding the SConstruct file in repositories

   SCons will also search in repositories for the SConstruct file and any
   specified SConscript files. This poses a problem, though: how can SCons
   search a repository tree for an SConstruct file if the SConstruct file
   itself contains the information about the pathname of the repository?
   To solve this problem, SCons allows you to specify repository
   directories on the command line using the -Y option:
      % scons -Q -Y /usr/repository1 -Y /usr/repository2

   When looking for source or derived files, SCons will first search the
   repositories specified on the command line, and then search the
   repositories specified in the SConstruct or SConscript files.
     __________________________________________________________________

23.5. Finding derived files in repositories

   If a repository contains not only source files, but also derived files
   (such as object files, libraries, or executables), SCons will perform
   its normal MD5 signature calculation to decide if a derived file in a
   repository is up-to-date, or the derived file must be rebuilt in the
   local build directory. For the SCons signature calculation to work
   correctly, a repository tree must contain the .sconsign files that
   SCons uses to keep track of signature information.

   Usually, this would be done by a build integrator who would run SCons
   in the repository to create all of its derived files and .sconsign
   files, or who would run SCons in a separate build directory and copy
   the resulting tree to the desired repository:
      % cd /usr/repository1
      % scons -Q
      cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
      cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o file1.o file2.o

   (Note that this is safe even if the SConstruct file lists
   /usr/repository1 as a repository, because SCons will remove the current
   build directory from its repository list for that invocation.)

   Now, with the repository populated, we only need to create the one
   local source file we're interested in working with at the moment, and
   use the -Y option to tell SCons to fetch any other files it needs from
   the repository:
      % cd $HOME/build
      % edit hello.c
      % scons -Q -Y /usr/repository1
      cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o /usr/repository1/file1.o /usr/repository1/file2.o

   Notice that SCons realizes that it does not need to rebuild local
   copies file1.o and file2.o files, but instead uses the already-compiled
   files from the repository.
     __________________________________________________________________

23.6. Guaranteeing local copies of files

   If the repository tree contains the complete results of a build, and we
   try to build from the repository without any files in our local tree,
   something moderately surprising happens:
      % mkdir $HOME/build2
      % cd $HOME/build2
      % scons -Q -Y /usr/all/repository hello
      scons: `hello' is up-to-date.

   Why does SCons say that the hello program is up-to-date when there is
   no hello program in the local build directory? Because the repository
   (not the local directory) contains the up-to-date hello program, and
   SCons correctly determines that nothing needs to be done to rebuild
   that up-to-date copy of the file.

   There are, however, many times when you want to ensure that a local
   copy of a file always exists. A packaging or testing script, for
   example, may assume that certain generated files exist locally. To tell
   SCons to make a copy of any up-to-date repository file in the local
   build directory, use the Local function:
       env = Environment()
       hello = env.Program('hello.c')
       Local(hello)

   If we then run the same command, SCons will make a local copy of the
   program from the repository copy, and tell you that it is doing so:
      % scons -Y /usr/all/repository hello
      Local copy of hello from /usr/all/repository/hello
      scons: `hello' is up-to-date.

   (Notice that, because the act of making the local copy is not
   considered a "build" of the hello file, SCons still reports that it is
   up-to-date.)
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 24. Multi-Platform Configuration (Autoconf Functionality)

   SCons has integrated support for multi-platform build configuration
   similar to that offered by GNU Autoconf, such as figuring out what
   libraries or header files are available on the local system. This
   section describes how to use this SCons feature.

   Note

        This chapter is still under development, so not everything is explained
        as well as it should be. See the SCons man page for additional
        information.
     __________________________________________________________________

24.1. Configure Contexts

   The basic framework for multi-platform build configuration in SCons is
   to attach a configure context to a construction environment by calling
   the Configure function, perform a number of checks for libraries,
   functions, header files, etc., and to then call the configure context's
   Finish method to finish off the configuration:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    # Checks for libraries, header files, etc. go here!
    env = conf.Finish()

   SCons provides a number of basic checks, as well as a mechanism for
   adding your own custom checks.

   Note that SCons uses its own dependency mechanism to determine when a
   check needs to be run--that is, SCons does not run the checks every
   time it is invoked, but caches the values returned by previous checks
   and uses the cached values unless something has changed. This saves a
   tremendous amount of developer time while working on cross-platform
   build issues.

   The next sections describe the basic checks that SCons supports, as
   well as how to add your own custom checks.
     __________________________________________________________________

24.2. Checking for the Existence of Header Files

   Testing the existence of a header file requires knowing what language
   the header file is. A configure context has a CheckCHeader method that
   checks for the existence of a C header file:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckCHeader('math.h'):
        print 'Math.h must be installed!'
        Exit(1)
    if conf.CheckCHeader('foo.h'):
        conf.env.Append('-DHAS_FOO_H')
    env = conf.Finish()

   Note that you can choose to terminate the build if a given header file
   doesn't exist, or you can modify the construction environment based on
   the existence of a header file.

   If you need to check for the existence a C++ header file, use the
   CheckCXXHeader method:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckCXXHeader('vector.h'):
        print 'vector.h must be installed!'
        Exit(1)
    env = conf.Finish()
     __________________________________________________________________

24.3. Checking for the Availability of a Function

   Check for the availability of a specific function using the CheckFunc
   method:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckFunc('strcpy'):
        print 'Did not find strcpy(), using local version'
        conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES = '-Dstrcpy=my_local_strcpy')
    env = conf.Finish()
     __________________________________________________________________

24.4. Checking for the Availability of a Library

   Check for the availability of a library using the CheckLib method. You
   only specify the basename of the library, you don't need to add a lib
   prefix or a .a or .lib suffix:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckLib('m'):
        print 'Did not find libm.a or m.lib, exiting!'
        Exit(1)
    env = conf.Finish()

   Because the ability to use a library successfully often depends on
   having access to a header file that describes the library's interface,
   you can check for a library and a header file at the same time by using
   the CheckLibWithHeader method:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckLibWithHeader('m', 'math.h', 'c'):
        print 'Did not find libm.a or m.lib, exiting!'
        Exit(1)
    env = conf.Finish()

   This is essentially shorthand for separate calls to the CheckHeader and
   CheckLib functions.
     __________________________________________________________________

24.5. Checking for the Availability of a typedef

   Check for the availability of a typedef by using the CheckType method:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckType('off_t'):
        print 'Did not find off_t typedef, assuming int'
        conf.env.Append(CCFLAGS = '-Doff_t=int')
    env = conf.Finish()

   You can also add a string that will be placed at the beginning of the
   test file that will be used to check for the typedef. This provide a
   way to specify files that must be included to find the typedef:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env)
    if not conf.CheckType('off_t', '#include <sys/types.h>\n'):
        print 'Did not find off_t typedef, assuming int'
        conf.env.Append(CCFLAGS = '-Doff_t=int')
    env = conf.Finish()
     __________________________________________________________________

24.6. Adding Your Own Custom Checks

   A custom check is a Python function that checks for a certain condition
   to exist on the running system, usually using methods that SCons
   supplies to take care of the details of checking whether a compilation
   succeeds, a link succeeds, a program is runnable, etc. A simple custom
   check for the existence of a specific library might look as follows:
    mylib_test_source_file = """
    #include <mylib.h>
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        MyLibrary mylib(argc, argv);
        return 0;
    }
    """

    def CheckMyLibrary(context):
        context.Message('Checking for MyLibrary...')
        result = context.TryLink(mylib_test_source_file, '.c')
        context.Result(result)
        return result

   The Message and Result methods should typically begin and end a custom
   check to let the user know what's going on: the Message call prints the
   specified message (with no trailing newline) and the Result call prints
   yes if the check succeeds and no if it doesn't. The TryLink method
   actually tests for whether the specified program text will successfully
   link.

   (Note that a custom check can modify its check based on any arguments
   you choose to pass it, or by using or modifying the configure context
   environment in the context.env attribute.)

   This custom check function is then attached to the configure context by
   passing a dictionary to the Configure call that maps a name of the
   check to the underlying function:
    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env, custom_tests = {'CheckMyLibrary' : CheckMyLibrary})

   You'll typically want to make the check and the function name the same,
   as we've done here, to avoid potential confusion.

   We can then put these pieces together and actually call the
   CheckMyLibrary check as follows:
    mylib_test_source_file = """
    #include <mylib.h>
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        MyLibrary mylib(argc, argv);
        return 0;
    }
    """

    def CheckMyLibrary(context):
        context.Message('Checking for MyLibrary... ')
        result = context.TryLink(mylib_test_source_file, '.c')
        context.Result(result)
        return result

    env = Environment()
    conf = Configure(env, custom_tests = {'CheckMyLibrary' : CheckMyLibrary})
    if not conf.CheckMyLibrary():
        print 'MyLibrary is not installed!'
        Exit(1)
    env = conf.Finish()

    # We would then add actual calls like Program() to build
    # something using the "env" construction environment.

   If MyLibrary is not installed on the system, the output will look like:
    % scons
    scons: Reading SConscript file ...
    Checking for MyLibrary... failed
    MyLibrary is not installed!

   If MyLibrary is installed, the output will look like:
    % scons
    scons: Reading SConscript file ...
    Checking for MyLibrary... failed
    scons: done reading SConscript
    scons: Building targets ...
        .
        .
        .
     __________________________________________________________________

24.7. Not Configuring When Cleaning Targets

   Using multi-platform configuration as described in the previous
   sections will run the configuration commands even when invoking scons
   -c to clean targets:
    % scons -Q -c
    Checking for MyLibrary... yes
    Removed foo.o
    Removed foo

   Although running the platform checks when removing targets doesn't hurt
   anything, it's usually unnecessary. You can avoid this by using the
   GetOption(); method to check whether the -c (clean) option has been
   invoked on the command line:
    env = Environment()
    if not env.GetOption('clean'):
        conf = Configure(env, custom_tests = {'CheckMyLibrary' : CheckMyLibrary}
)
        if not conf.CheckMyLibrary():
            print 'MyLibrary is not installed!'
            Exit(1)
        env = conf.Finish()

    % scons -Q -c
    Removed foo.o
    Removed foo
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 25. Caching Built Files

   On multi-developer software projects, you can sometimes speed up every
   developer's builds a lot by allowing them to share the derived files
   that they build. SCons makes this easy, as well as reliable.
     __________________________________________________________________

25.1. Specifying the Shared Cache Directory

   To enable sharing of derived files, use the CacheDir function in any
   SConscript file:
       CacheDir('/usr/local/build_cache')

   Note that the directory you specify must already exist and be readable
   and writable by all developers who will be sharing derived files. It
   should also be in some central location that all builds will be able to
   access. In environments where developers are using separate systems
   (like individual workstations) for builds, this directory would
   typically be on a shared or NFS-mounted file system.

   Here's what happens: When a build has a CacheDir specified, every time
   a file is built, it is stored in the shared cache directory along with
   its MD5 build signature. [306][5] On subsequent builds, before an
   action is invoked to build a file, SCons will check the shared cache
   directory to see if a file with the exact same build signature already
   exists. If so, the derived file will not be built locally, but will be
   copied into the local build directory from the shared cache directory,
   like so:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q
      Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
      Retrieved `hello' from cache

   Note that the CacheDir feature still calculates MD5 build sigantures
   for the shared cache file names even if you configure SCons to use
   timestamps to decide if files are up to date. (See the [307]Chapter 6
   chapter for information about the Decider function.) Consequently,
   using CacheDir may reduce or eliminate any potential performance
   improvements from using timestamps for up-to-date decisions.
     __________________________________________________________________

25.2. Keeping Build Output Consistent

   One potential drawback to using a shared cache is that the output
   printed by SCons can be inconsistent from invocation to invocation,
   because any given file may be rebuilt one time and retrieved from the
   shared cache the next time. This can make analyzing build output more
   difficult, especially for automated scripts that expect consistent
   output each time.

   If, however, you use the --cache-show option, SCons will print the
   command line that it would have executed to build the file, even when
   it is retrieving the file from the shared cache. This makes the build
   output consistent every time the build is run:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q --cache-show
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   The trade-off, of course, is that you no longer know whether or not
   SCons has retrieved a derived file from cache or has rebuilt it
   locally.
     __________________________________________________________________

25.3. Not Using the Shared Cache for Specific Files

   You may want to disable caching for certain specific files in your
   configuration. For example, if you only want to put executable files in
   a central cache, but not the intermediate object files, you can use the
   NoCache function to specify that the object files should not be cached:
       env = Environment()
       obj = env.Object('hello.c')
       env.Program('hello.c')
       CacheDir('cache')
       NoCache('hello.o')

   Then when you run scons after cleaning the built targets, it will
   recompile the object file locally (since it doesn't exist in the shared
   cache directory), but still realize that the shared cache directory
   contains an up-to-date executable program that can be retrieved instead
   of re-linking:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      Retrieved `hello' from cache
     __________________________________________________________________

25.4. Disabling the Shared Cache

   Retrieving an already-built file from the shared cache is usually a
   significant time-savings over rebuilding the file, but how much of a
   savings (or even whether it saves time at all) can depend a great deal
   on your system or network configuration. For example, retrieving cached
   files from a busy server over a busy network might end up being slower
   than rebuilding the files locally.

   In these cases, you can specify the --cache-disable command-line option
   to tell SCons to not retrieve already-built files from the shared cache
   directory:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q
      Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
      Retrieved `hello' from cache
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q --cache-disable
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
     __________________________________________________________________

25.5. Populating a Shared Cache With Already-Built Files

   Sometimes, you may have one or more derived files already built in your
   local build tree that you wish to make available to other people doing
   builds. For example, you may find it more effective to perform
   integration builds with the cache disabled (per the previous section)
   and only populate the shared cache directory with the built files after
   the integration build has completed successfully. This way, the cache
   will only get filled up with derived files that are part of a complete,
   successful build not with files that might be later overwritten while
   you debug integration problems.

   In this case, you can use the the --cache-force option to tell SCons to
   put all derived files in the cache, even if the files already exist in
   your local tree from having been built by a previous invocation:
      % scons -Q --cache-disable
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q -c
      Removed hello.o
      Removed hello
      % scons -Q --cache-disable
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o
      % scons -Q --cache-force
      scons: `.' is up to date.
      % scons -Q
      scons: `.' is up to date.

   Notice how the above sample run demonstrates that the --cache-disable
   option avoids putting the built hello.o and hello files in the cache,
   but after using the --cache-force option, the files have been put in
   the cache for the next invocation to retrieve.
     __________________________________________________________________

25.6. Minimizing Cache Contention: the --random Option

   If you allow multiple builds to update the shared cache directory
   simultaneously, two builds that occur at the same time can sometimes
   start "racing" with one another to build the same files in the same
   order. If, for example, you are linking multiple files into an
   executable program:
       Program('prog',
               ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c', 'f4.c', 'f5.c'])

   SCons will normally build the input object files on which the program
   depends in their normal, sorted order:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
      cc -o f4.o -c f4.c
      cc -o f5.o -c f5.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o f5.o

   But if two such builds take place simultaneously, they may each look in
   the cache at nearly the same time and both decide that f1.o must be
   rebuilt and pushed into the shared cache directory, then both decide
   that f2.o must be rebuilt (and pushed into the shared cache directory),
   then both decide that f3.o must be rebuilt... This won't cause any
   actual build problems--both builds will succeed, generate correct
   output files, and populate the cache--but it does represent wasted
   effort.

   To alleviate such contention for the cache, you can use the --random
   command-line option to tell SCons to build dependencies in a random
   order:
      % scons -Q --random
      cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
      cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
      cc -o f5.o -c f5.c
      cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
      cc -o f4.o -c f4.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o f5.o

   Multiple builds using the --random option will usually build their
   dependencies in different, random orders, which minimizes the chances
   for a lot of contention for same-named files in the shared cache
   directory. Multiple simultaneous builds might still race to try to
   build the same target file on occasion, but long sequences of
   inefficient contention should be rare.

   Note, of course, the --random option will cause the output that SCons
   prints to be inconsistent from invocation to invocation, which may be
   an issue when trying to compare output from different build runs.

   If you want to make sure dependencies will be built in a random order
   without having to specify the --random on very command line, you can
   use the SetOption function to set the random option within any
   SConscript file:
       Program('prog',
               ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c', 'f4.c', 'f5.c'])

       SetOption('random', 1)
       Program('prog',
               ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c', 'f4.c', 'f5.c'])
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 26. Alias Targets

   We've already seen how you can use the Alias function to create a
   target named install:
     env = Environment()
     hello = env.Program('hello.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
     env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   You can then use this alias on the command line to tell SCons more
   naturally that you want to install files:
     % scons -Q install
     cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
     cc -o hello hello.o
     Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

   Like other Builder methods, though, the Alias method returns an object
   representing the alias being built. You can then use this object as
   input to anothother Builder. This is especially useful if you use such
   an object as input to another call to the Alias Builder, allowing you
   to create a hierarchy of nested aliases:
     env = Environment()
     p = env.Program('foo.c')
     l = env.Library('bar.c')
     env.Install('/usr/bin', p)
     env.Install('/usr/lib', l)
     ib = env.Alias('install-bin', '/usr/bin')
     il = env.Alias('install-lib', '/usr/lib')
     env.Alias('install', [ib, il])

   This example defines separate install, install-bin, and install-lib
   aliases, allowing you finer control over what gets installed:
     % scons -Q install-bin
     cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
     cc -o foo foo.o
     Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
     % scons -Q install-lib
     cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
     ar rc libbar.a bar.o
     ranlib libbar.a
     Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"
     % scons -Q -c /
     Removed foo.o
     Removed foo
     Removed /usr/bin/foo
     Removed bar.o
     Removed libbar.a
     Removed /usr/lib/libbar.a
     % scons -Q install
     cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
     cc -o foo foo.o
     Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
     cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
     ar rc libbar.a bar.o
     ranlib libbar.a
     Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 27. Java Builds

   So far, we've been using examples of building C and C++ programs to
   demonstrate the features of SCons. SCons also supports building Java
   programs, but Java builds are handled slightly differently, which
   reflects the ways in which the Java compiler and tools build programs
   differently than other languages' tool chains.
     __________________________________________________________________

27.1. Building Java Class Files: the Java Builder

   The basic activity when programming in Java, of course, is to take one
   or more .java files containing Java source code and to call the Java
   compiler to turn them into one or more .class files. In SCons, you do
   this by giving the [308]Java Builder a target directory in which to put
   the .class files, and a source directory that contains the .java files:
      Java('classes', 'src')

   If the src directory contains three .java source files, then running
   SCons might look like this:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/E
xample3.java

   SCons will actually search the src directory tree for all of the .java
   files. The Java compiler will then create the necessary class files in
   the classes subdirectory, based on the class names found in the .java
   files.
     __________________________________________________________________

27.2. How SCons Handles Java Dependencies

   In addition to searching the source directory for .java files, SCons
   actually runs the .java files through a stripped-down Java parser that
   figures out what classes are defined. In other words, SCons knows,
   without you having to tell it, what .class files will be produced by
   the javac call. So our one-liner example from the preceding section:
      Java('classes', 'src')

   Will not only tell you reliably that the .class files in the classes
   subdirectory are up-to-date:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/E
xample3.java
      % scons -Q classes
      scons: `classes' is up to date.

   But it will also remove all of the generated .class files, even for
   inner classes, without you having to specify them manually. For
   example, if our Example1.java and Example3.java files both define
   additional classes, and the class defined in Example2.java has an inner
   class, running scons -c will clean up all of those .class files as
   well:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/E
xample3.java
      % scons -Q -c classes
      Removed classes/Example1.class
      Removed classes/AdditionalClass1.class
      Removed classes/Example2$Inner2.class
      Removed classes/Example2.class
      Removed classes/Example3.class
      Removed classes/AdditionalClass3.class

   To ensure correct handling of .class dependencies in all cases, you
   need to tell SCons which Java version is being used. This is needed
   because Java 1.5 changed the .class file names for nested anonymous
   inner classes. Use the JAVAVERSION construction variable to specify the
   version in use. With Java 1.6, the one-liner example can then be
   defined like this:
      Java('classes', 'src', JAVAVERSION='1.6')

   See JAVAVERSION in the man page for more information.
     __________________________________________________________________

27.3. Building Java Archive (.jar) Files: the Jar Builder

   After building the class files, it's common to collect them into a Java
   archive (.jar) file, which you do by calling the [309]Jar Builder
   method. If you want to just collect all of the class files within a
   subdirectory, you can just specify that subdirectory as the Jar source:
      Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
      Jar(target = 'test.jar', source = 'classes')

   SCons will then pass that directory to the jar command, which will
   collect all of the underlying .class files:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/E
xample3.java
      jar cf test.jar classes

   If you want to keep all of the .class files for multiple programs in
   one location, and only archive some of them in each .jar file, you can
   pass the Jar builder a list of files as its source. It's extremely
   simple to create multiple .jar files this way, using the lists of
   target class files created by calls to the [310]Java builder as sources
   to the various Jar calls:
      prog1_class_files = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'prog1')
      prog2_class_files = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'prog2')
      Jar(target = 'prog1.jar', source = prog1_class_files)
      Jar(target = 'prog2.jar', source = prog2_class_files)

   This will then create prog1.jar and prog2.jar next to the
   subdirectories that contain their .java files:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath prog1 prog1/Example1.java prog1/Example2.java
      javac -d classes -sourcepath prog2 prog2/Example3.java prog2/Example4.java
      jar cf prog1.jar -C classes Example1.class -C classes Example2.class
      jar cf prog2.jar -C classes Example3.class -C classes Example4.class
     __________________________________________________________________

27.4. Building C Header and Stub Files: the JavaH Builder

   You can generate C header and source files for implementing native
   methods, by using the [311]JavaH Builder. There are several ways of
   using the JavaH Builder. One typical invocation might look like:
      classes = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src/pkg/sub')
      JavaH(target = 'native', source = classes)

   The source is a list of class files generated by the call to the
   [312]Java Builder, and the target is the output directory in which we
   want the C header files placed. The target gets converted into the -d
   when SCons runs javah:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg
/sub/Example2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
      javah -d native -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg.s
ub.Example3

   In this case, the call to javah will generate the header files
   native/pkg_sub_Example1.h, native/pkg_sub_Example2.h and
   native/pkg_sub_Example3.h. Notice that SCons remembered that the class
   files were generated with a target directory of classes, and that it
   then specified that target directory as the -classpath option to the
   call to javah.

   Although it's more convenient to use the list of class files returned
   by the Java Builder as the source of a call to the JavaH Builder, you
   can specify the list of class files by hand, if you prefer. If you do,
   you need to set the [313]$JAVACLASSDIR construction variable when
   calling JavaH:
      Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src/pkg/sub')
      class_file_list = ['classes/pkg/sub/Example1.class',
                         'classes/pkg/sub/Example2.class',
                         'classes/pkg/sub/Example3.class']
      JavaH(target = 'native', source = class_file_list, JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes
')

   The $JAVACLASSDIR value then gets converted into the -classpath when
   SCons runs javah:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg
/sub/Example2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
      javah -d native -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg.s
ub.Example3

   Lastly, if you don't want a separate header file generated for each
   source file, you can specify an explicit File Node as the target of the
   JavaH Builder:
      classes = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src/pkg/sub')
      JavaH(target = File('native.h'), source = classes)

   Because SCons assumes by default that the target of the JavaH builder
   is a directory, you need to use the File function to make sure that
   SCons doesn't create a directory named native.h. When a file is used,
   though, SCons correctly converts the file name into the javah -o
   option:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg
/sub/Example2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
      javah -o native.h -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg
.sub.Example3
     __________________________________________________________________

27.5. Building RMI Stub and Skeleton Class Files: the RMIC Builder

   You can generate Remote Method Invocation stubs by using the [314]RMIC
   Builder. The source is a list of directories, typically returned by a
   call to the [315]Java Builder, and the target is an output directory
   where the _Stub.class and _Skel.class files will be placed:
      classes = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src/pkg/sub')
      RMIC(target = 'outdir', source = classes)

   As it did with the [316]JavaH Builder, SCons remembers the class
   directory and passes it as the -classpath option to rmic:
      % scons -Q
      javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg
/sub/Example2.java
      rmic -d outdir -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2

   This example would generate the files
   outdir/pkg/sub/Example1_Skel.class, outdir/pkg/sub/Example1_Stub.class,
   outdir/pkg/sub/Example2_Skel.class and
   outdir/pkg/sub/Example2_Stub.class.

Chapter 28. Miscellaneous Functionality

   SCons supports a lot of additional functionality that doesn't readily
   fit into the other chapters.
     __________________________________________________________________

28.1. Verifying the Python Version: the EnsurePythonVersion Function

   Although the SCons code itself will run on any Python version 2.4 or
   later, you are perfectly free to make use of Python syntax and modules
   from more modern versions (for example, Python 2.5 or 2.6) when writing
   your SConscript files or your own local modules. If you do this, it's
   usually helpful to configure SCons to exit gracefully with an error
   message if it's being run with a version of Python that simply won't
   work with your code. This is especially true if you're going to use
   SCons to build source code that you plan to distribute publicly, where
   you can't be sure of the Python version that an anonymous remote user
   might use to try to build your software.

   SCons provides an EnsurePythonVersion function for this. You simply
   pass it the major and minor versions numbers of the version of Python
   you require:
      EnsurePythonVersion(2, 5)

   And then SCons will exit with the following error message when a user
   runs it with an unsupported earlier version of Python:
      % scons -Q
      Python 2.5 or greater required, but you have Python 2.3.6
     __________________________________________________________________

28.2. Verifying the SCons Version: the EnsureSConsVersion Function

   You may, of course, write your SConscript files to use features that
   were only added in recent versions of SCons. When you publicly
   distribute software that is built using SCons, it's helpful to have
   SCons verify the version being used and exit gracefully with an error
   message if the user's version of SCons won't work with your SConscript
   files. SCons provides an EnsureSConsVersion function that verifies the
   version of SCons in the same the EnsurePythonVersion function verifies
   the version of Python, by passing in the major and minor versions
   numbers of the version of SCons you require:
      EnsureSConsVersion(1, 0)

   And then SCons will exit with the following error message when a user
   runs it with an unsupported earlier version of SCons:
      % scons -Q
      SCons 1.0 or greater required, but you have SCons 0.98.5
     __________________________________________________________________

28.3. Explicitly Terminating SCons While Reading SConscript Files: the Exit
Function

   SCons supports an Exit function which can be used to terminate SCons
   while reading the SConscript files, usually because you've detected a
   condition under which it doesn't make sense to proceed:
      if ARGUMENTS.get('FUTURE'):
          print "The FUTURE option is not supported yet!"
          Exit(2)
      env = Environment()
      env.Program('hello.c')

      % scons -Q FUTURE=1
      The FUTURE option is not supported yet!
      % scons -Q
      cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
      cc -o hello hello.o

   The Exit function takes as an argument the (numeric) exit status that
   you want SCons to exit with. If you don't specify a value, the default
   is to exit with 0, which indicates successful execution.

   Note that the Exit function is equivalent to calling the Python
   sys.exit function (which the it actually calls), but because Exit is a
   SCons function, you don't have to import the Python sys module to use
   it.
     __________________________________________________________________

28.4. Searching for Files: the FindFile Function

   The FindFile function searches for a file in a list of directories. If
   there is only one directory, it can be given as a simple string. The
   function returns a File node if a matching file exists, or None if no
   file is found. (See the documentation for the Glob function for an
   alternative way of searching for entries in a directory.)
       # one directory
       print FindFile('missing', '.')
       t = FindFile('exists', '.')
       print t.__class__, t

       % scons -Q
       None
       <class 'SCons.Node.FS.File'> exists
       scons: `.' is up to date.

       # several directories
       includes = [ '.', 'include', 'src/include']
       headers = [ 'nonesuch.h', 'config.h', 'private.h', 'dist.h']
       for hdr in headers:
           print '%-12s' % ('%s:' % hdr), FindFile(hdr, includes)

       % scons -Q
       nonesuch.h:  None
       config.h:    config.h
       private.h:   src/include/private.h
       dist.h:      include/dist.h
       scons: `.' is up to date.

   If the file exists in more than one directory, only the first
   occurrence is returned.
        print FindFile('multiple', ['sub1', 'sub2', 'sub3'])
        print FindFile('multiple', ['sub2', 'sub3', 'sub1'])
        print FindFile('multiple', ['sub3', 'sub1', 'sub2'])

       % scons -Q
       sub1/multiple
       sub2/multiple
       sub3/multiple
       scons: `.' is up to date.

   In addition to existing files, FindFile will also find derived files
   (that is, non-leaf files) that haven't been built yet. (Leaf files
   should already exist, or the build will fail!)
       # Neither file exists, so build will fail
       Command('derived', 'leaf', 'cat >$TARGET $SOURCE')
       print FindFile('leaf', '.')
       print FindFile('derived', '.')

       % scons -Q
       None
       derived
       scons: *** [derived] Source `leaf' not found, needed by target `derived'.

       # Neither file exists, so build will fail
       Command('derived', 'leaf', 'cat >$TARGET $SOURCE')
       print FindFile('leaf', '.')
       print FindFile('derived', '.')

       # Only 'leaf' exists
       Command('derived', 'leaf', 'cat >$TARGET $SOURCE')
       print FindFile('leaf', '.')
       print FindFile('derived', '.')

       % scons -Q
       leaf
       derived
       cat > derived leaf

   If a source file exists, FindFile will correctly return the name in the
   build directory.
       # Only 'src/leaf' exists
       VariantDir('build', 'src')
       print FindFile('leaf', 'build')

       % scons -Q
       build/leaf
       scons: `.' is up to date.
     __________________________________________________________________

28.5. Handling Nested Lists: the Flatten Function

   SCons supports a Flatten function which takes an input Python sequence
   (list or tuple) and returns a flattened list containing just the
   individual elements of the sequence. This can be handy when trying to
   examine a list composed of the lists returned by calls to various
   Builders. For example, you might collect object files built in
   different ways into one call to the Program Builder by just enclosing
   them in a list, as follows:
      objects = [
          Object('prog1.c'),
          Object('prog2.c', CCFLAGS='-DFOO'),
      ]
      Program(objects)

   Because the Builder calls in SCons flatten their input lists, this
   works just fine to build the program:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
      cc -o prog2.o -c -DFOO prog2.c
      cc -o prog1 prog1.o prog2.o

   But if you were debugging your build and wanted to print the absolute
   path of each object file in the objects list, you might try the
   following simple approach, trying to print each Node's abspath
   attribute:
      objects = [
          Object('prog1.c'),
          Object('prog2.c', CCFLAGS='-DFOO'),
      ]
      Program(objects)

      for object_file in objects:
          print object_file.abspath

   This does not work as expected because each call to str is operating an
   embedded list returned by each Object call, not on the underlying Nodes
   within those lists:
      % scons -Q
      AttributeError: 'NodeList' object has no attribute 'abspath':
        File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 8:
          print object_file.abspath

   The solution is to use the Flatten function so that you can pass each
   Node to the str separately:
      objects = [
          Object('prog1.c'),
          Object('prog2.c', CCFLAGS='-DFOO'),
      ]
      Program(objects)

      for object_file in Flatten(objects):
          print object_file.abspath

      % scons -Q
      /home/me/project/prog1.o
      /home/me/project/prog2.o
      cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
      cc -o prog2.o -c -DFOO prog2.c
      cc -o prog1 prog1.o prog2.o
     __________________________________________________________________

28.6. Finding the Invocation Directory: the GetLaunchDir Function

   If you need to find the directory from which the user invoked the scons
   command, you can use the GetLaunchDir function:
      env = Environment(
          LAUNCHDIR = GetLaunchDir(),
      )
      env.Command('directory_build_info',
                  '$LAUNCHDIR/build_info'
                  Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'))

   Because SCons is usually invoked from the top-level directory in which
   the SConstruct file lives, the Python os.getcwd() is often equivalent.
   However, the SCons -u, -U and -D command-line options, when invoked
   from a subdirectory, will cause SCons to change to the directory in
   which the SConstruct file is found. When those options are used,
   GetLaunchDir will still return the path to the user's invoking
   subdirectory, allowing the SConscript configuration to still get at
   configuration (or other) files from the originating directory.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 29. Troubleshooting

   The experience of configuring any software build tool to build a large
   code base usually, at some point, involves trying to figure out why the
   tool is behaving a certain way, and how to get it to behave the way you
   want. SCons is no different. This appendix contains a number of
   different ways in which you can get some additional insight into SCons'
   behavior.

   Note that we're always interested in trying to improve how you can
   troubleshoot configuration problems. If you run into a problem that has
   you scratching your head, and which there just doesn't seem to be a
   good way to debug, odds are pretty good that someone else will run into
   the same problem, too. If so, please let the SCons development team
   know (preferably by filing a bug report or feature request at our
   project pages at tigris.org) so that we can use your feedback to try to
   come up with a better way to help you, and others, get the necessary
   insight into SCons behavior to help identify and fix configuration
   issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

29.1. Why is That Target Being Rebuilt? the --debug=explain Option

   Let's look at a simple example of a misconfigured build that causes a
   target to be rebuilt every time SCons is run:
      # Intentionally misspell the output file name in the
      # command used to create the file:
      Command('file.out', 'file.in', 'cp $SOURCE file.oout')

   (Note to Windows users: The POSIX cp command copies the first file
   named on the command line to the second file. In our example, it copies
   the file.in file to the file.out file.)

   Now if we run SCons multiple times on this example, we see that it
   re-runs the cp command every time:
      % scons -Q
      cp file.in file.oout
      % scons -Q
      cp file.in file.oout
      % scons -Q
      cp file.in file.oout

   In this example, the underlying cause is obvious: we've intentionally
   misspelled the output file name in the cp command, so the command
   doesn't actually build the file.out file that we've told SCons to
   expect. But if the problem weren't obvious, it would be helpful to
   specify the --debug=explain option on the command line to have SCons
   tell us very specifically why it's decided to rebuild the target:
      % scons -Q --debug=explain
      scons: building `file.out' because it doesn't exist
      cp file.in file.oout

   If this had been a more complicated example involving a lot of build
   output, having SCons tell us that it's trying to rebuild the target
   file because it doesn't exist would be an important clue that something
   was wrong with the command that we invoked to build it.

   The --debug=explain option also comes in handy to help figure out what
   input file changed. Given a simple configuration that builds a program
   from three source files, changing one of the source files and
   rebuilding with the --debug=explain option shows very specifically why
   SCons rebuilds the files that it does:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
      cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
      cc -o file3.o -c file3.c
      cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o
      % edit file2.c
          [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF file2.c]
      % scons -Q --debug=explain
      scons: rebuilding `file2.o' because `file2.c' changed
      cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
      scons: rebuilding `prog' because `file2.o' changed
      cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o

   This becomes even more helpful in identifying when a file is rebuilt
   due to a change in an implicit dependency, such as an incuded .h file.
   If the file1.c and file3.c files in our example both included a hello.h
   file, then changing that included file and re-running SCons with the
   --debug=explain option will pinpoint that it's the change to the
   included file that starts the chain of rebuilds:
      % scons -Q
      cc -o file1.o -c -I. file1.c
      cc -o file2.o -c -I. file2.c
      cc -o file3.o -c -I. file3.c
      cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o
      % edit hello.h
          [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
      % scons -Q --debug=explain
      scons: rebuilding `file1.o' because `hello.h' changed
      cc -o file1.o -c -I. file1.c
      scons: rebuilding `file3.o' because `hello.h' changed
      cc -o file3.o -c -I. file3.c
      scons: rebuilding `prog' because:
                 `file1.o' changed
                 `file3.o' changed
      cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o

   (Note that the --debug=explain option will only tell you why SCons
   decided to rebuild necessary targets. It does not tell you what files
   it examined when deciding not to rebuild a target file, which is often
   a more valuable question to answer.)
     __________________________________________________________________

29.2. What's in That Construction Environment? the Dump Method

   When you create a construction environment, SCons populates it with
   construction variables that are set up for various compilers, linkers
   and utilities that it finds on your system. Although this is usually
   helpful and what you want, it might be frustrating if SCons doesn't set
   certain variables that you expect to be set. In situations like this,
   it's sometimes helpful to use the construction environment Dump method
   to print all or some of the construction variables. Note that the Dump
   method returns the representation of the variables in the environment
   for you to print (or otherwise manipulate):
         env = Environment()
         print env.Dump()

   On a POSIX system with gcc installed, this might generate:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...

   The construction environments in these examples have actually been
   restricted to just gcc and Visual C++, respectively. In a real-life
   situation, the construction environments will likely contain a great
   many more variables. Also note that we've massaged the example output
   above to make the memory address of all objects a constant 0x700000. In
   reality, you would see a different hexadecimal number for each object.

   To make it easier to see just what you're interested in, the Dump
   method allows you to specify a specific constrcution variable that you
   want to disply. For example, it's not unusual to want to verify the
   external environment used to execute build commands, to make sure that
   the PATH and other environment variables are set up the way they should
   be. You can do this as follows:
         env = Environment()
         print env.Dump('ENV')

   Which might display the following when executed on a POSIX system:
      % scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      { 'PATH': '/usr/local/bin:/opt/bin:/bin:/usr/bin'}
      scons: done reading SConscript files.
      scons: Building targets ...
      scons: `.' is up to date.
      scons: done building targets.

   And the following when executed on a Windows system:
      C:\>scons
      scons: Reading SConscript files ...
      { 'PATH': 'C:\\WINDOWS\\System32',
        'PATHEXT': '.COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD',
        'SystemRoot': 'C:\\WINDOWS'}
      scons: done reading SConscript files.

29.3. What Dependencies Does SCons Know About? the --tree Option

   Sometimes the best way to try to figure out what SCons is doing is
   simply to take a look at the dependency graph that it constructs based
   on your SConscript files. The --tree option will display all or part of
   the SCons dependency graph in an "ASCII art" graphical format that
   shows the dependency hierarchy.

   For example, given the following input SConstruct file:
         env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
         env.Program('prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   Running SCons with the --tree=all option yields:
      % scons -Q --tree=all
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
      +-.
        +-SConstruct
        +-f1.c
        +-f1.o
        | +-f1.c
        | +-inc.h
        +-f2.c
        +-f2.o
        | +-f2.c
        | +-inc.h
        +-f3.c
        +-f3.o
        | +-f3.c
        | +-inc.h
        +-inc.h
        +-prog
          +-f1.o
          | +-f1.c
          | +-inc.h
          +-f2.o
          | +-f2.c
          | +-inc.h
          +-f3.o
            +-f3.c
            +-inc.h

   The tree will also be printed when the -n (no execute) option is used,
   which allows you to examine the dependency graph for a configuration
   without actually rebuilding anything in the tree.

   The --tree option only prints the dependency graph for the specified
   targets (or the default target(s) if none are specified on the command
   line). So if you specify a target like f2.o on the command line, the
   --tree option will only print the dependency graph for that file:
      % scons -Q --tree=all f2.o
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      +-f2.o
        +-f2.c
        +-inc.h

   This is, of course, useful for restricting the output from a very large
   build configuration to just a portion in which you're interested.
   Multiple targets are fine, in which case a tree will be printed for
   each specified target:
      % scons -Q --tree=all f1.o f3.o
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      +-f1.o
        +-f1.c
        +-inc.h
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      +-f3.o
        +-f3.c
        +-inc.h

   The status argument may be used to tell SCons to print status
   information about each file in the dependency graph:
      % scons -Q --tree=status
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
       E         = exists
        R        = exists in repository only
         b       = implicit builder
         B       = explicit builder
          S      = side effect
           P     = precious
            A    = always build
             C   = current
              N  = no clean
               H = no cache

      [E b      ]+-.
      [E     C  ]  +-SConstruct
      [E     C  ]  +-f1.c
      [E B   C  ]  +-f1.o
      [E     C  ]  | +-f1.c
      [E     C  ]  | +-inc.h
      [E     C  ]  +-f2.c
      [E B   C  ]  +-f2.o
      [E     C  ]  | +-f2.c
      [E     C  ]  | +-inc.h
      [E     C  ]  +-f3.c
      [E B   C  ]  +-f3.o
      [E     C  ]  | +-f3.c
      [E     C  ]  | +-inc.h
      [E     C  ]  +-inc.h
      [E B   C  ]  +-prog
      [E B   C  ]    +-f1.o
      [E     C  ]    | +-f1.c
      [E     C  ]    | +-inc.h
      [E B   C  ]    +-f2.o
      [E     C  ]    | +-f2.c
      [E     C  ]    | +-inc.h
      [E B   C  ]    +-f3.o
      [E     C  ]      +-f3.c
      [E     C  ]      +-inc.h

   Note that --tree=all,status is equivalent; the all is assumed if only
   status is present. As an alternative to all, you can specify
   --tree=derived to have SCons only print derived targets in the tree
   output, skipping source files (like .c and .h files):
      % scons -Q --tree=derived
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
      +-.
        +-f1.o
        +-f2.o
        +-f3.o
        +-prog
          +-f1.o
          +-f2.o
          +-f3.o

   You can use the status modifier with derived as well:
      % scons -Q --tree=derived,status
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
      cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
      cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
       E         = exists
        R        = exists in repository only
         b       = implicit builder
         B       = explicit builder
          S      = side effect
           P     = precious
            A    = always build
             C   = current
              N  = no clean
               H = no cache

      [E b      ]+-.
      [E B   C  ]  +-f1.o
      [E B   C  ]  +-f2.o
      [E B   C  ]  +-f3.o
      [E B   C  ]  +-prog
      [E B   C  ]    +-f1.o
      [E B   C  ]    +-f2.o
      [E B   C  ]    +-f3.o

   Note that the order of the --tree= arguments doesn't matter;
   --tree=status,derived is completely equivalent.

   The default behavior of the --tree option is to repeat all of the
   dependencies each time the library dependency (or any other dependency
   file) is encountered in the tree. If certain target files share other
   target files, such as two programs that use the same library:
         env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'],
                           LIBS = ['foo'],
                           LIBPATH = ['.'])
         env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
         env.Program('prog1.c')
         env.Program('prog2.c')

   Then there can be a lot of repetition in the --tree= output:
      % scons -Q --tree=all
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c

   In a large configuration with many internal libraries and include
   files, this can very quickly lead to huge output trees. To help make
   this more manageable, a prune modifier may be added to the option list,
   in which case SCons will print the name of a target that has already
   been visited during the tree-printing in [square brackets] as an
   indication that the dependencies of the target file may be found by
   looking farther up the tree:
      % scons -Q --tree=prune
      cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
      cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c

29.4. How is SCons Constructing the Command Lines It Executes? the
--debug=presub Option

   Sometimes it's useful to look at the pre-substitution string that SCons
   uses to generate the command lines it executes. This can be done with
   the --debug=presub option:
      % scons -Q --debug=presub
      Building prog.o with action:
        $CC -o $TARGET -c $CFLAGS $CCFLAGS $_CCOMCOM $SOURCES
      cc -o prog.o -c -I. prog.c
      Building prog with action:
        $SMART_LINKCOM
      cc -o prog prog.o
     __________________________________________________________________

29.5. Where is SCons Searching for Libraries? the --debug=findlibs Option

   To get some insight into what library names SCons is searching for, and
   in which directories it is searching, Use the --debug=findlibs option.
   Given the following input SConstruct file:
        env = Environment(LIBPATH = ['libs1', 'libs2'])
        env.Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo', 'bar'])

   And the libraries libfoo.a and libbar.a in libs1 and libs2,
   respectively, use of the --debug=findlibs option yields:
      % scons -Q --debug=findlibs
        findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.a' in 'libs1' ...
        findlibs: ... FOUND 'libfoo.a' in 'libs1'
        findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.so' in 'libs1' ...
        findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.so' in 'libs2' ...
        findlibs: looking for 'libbar.a' in 'libs1' ...
        findlibs: looking for 'libbar.a' in 'libs2' ...
        findlibs: ... FOUND 'libbar.a' in 'libs2'
        findlibs: looking for 'libbar.so' in 'libs1' ...
        findlibs: looking for 'libbar.so' in 'libs2' ...
      cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
      cc -o prog prog.o -Llibs1 -Llibs2 -lfoo -lbar
     __________________________________________________________________

29.6. Where is SCons Blowing Up? the --debug=stacktrace Option

   In general, SCons tries to keep its error messages short and
   informative. That means we usually try to avoid showing the stack
   traces that are familiar to experienced Python programmers, since they
   usually contain much more information than is useful to most people.

   For example, the following SConstruct file:
         Program('prog.c')

   Generates the following error if the prog.c file does not exist:
      % scons -Q
      scons: *** [prog.o] Source `prog.c' not found, needed by target `prog.o'.

   In this case, the error is pretty obvious. But if it weren't, and you
   wanted to try to get more information about the error, the
   --debug=stacktrace option would show you exactly where in the SCons
   source code the problem occurs:
      % scons -Q --debug=stacktrace
      scons: *** [prog.o] Source `prog.c' not found, needed by target `prog.o'.
      scons: internal stack trace:
        File "bootstrap/src/engine/SCons/Job.py", line 199, in start
          task.prepare()
        File "bootstrap/src/engine/SCons/Script/Main.py", line 167, in prepare
          return SCons.Taskmaster.OutOfDateTask.prepare(self)
        File "bootstrap/src/engine/SCons/Taskmaster.py", line 187, in prepare
          executor.prepare()
        File "bootstrap/src/engine/SCons/Executor.py", line 392, in prepare
          raise SCons.Errors.StopError(msg % (s, self.batches[0].targets[0]))

   Of course, if you do need to dive into the SCons source code, we'd like
   to know if, or how, the error messages or troubleshooting options could
   have been improved to avoid that. Not everyone has the necessary time
   or Python skill to dive into the source code, and we'd like to improve
   SCons for those people as well...

29.7. How is SCons Making Its Decisions? the --taskmastertrace Option

   The internal SCons subsystem that handles walking the dependency graph
   and controls the decision-making about what to rebuild is the
   Taskmaster. SCons supports a --taskmastertrace option that tells the
   Taskmaster to print information about the children (dependencies) of
   the various Nodes on its walk down the graph, which specific dependent
   Nodes are being evaluated, and in what order.

   The --taskmastertrace option takes as an argument the name of a file in
   which to put the trace output, with - (a single hyphen) indicating that
   the trace messages should be printed to the standard output:
      env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
      env.Program('prog.c')

      % scons -Q --taskmastertrace=- prog

      Task.postprocess():  node <executed   0   'prog'>

      Taskmaster: Looking for a node to evaluate
      Taskmaster: No candidate anymore.

   The --taskmastertrace option doesn't provide information about the
   actual calculations involved in deciding if a file is up-to-date, but
   it does show all of the dependencies it knows about for each Node, and
   the order in which those dependencies are evaluated. This can be useful
   as an alternate way to determine whether or not your SCons
   configuration, or the implicit dependency scan, has actually identified
   all the correct dependencies you want it to.

Appendix A. Construction Variables

   This appendix contains descriptions of all of the construction
   variables that are potentially available "out of the box" in this
   version of SCons. Whether or not setting a construction variable in a
   construction environment will actually have an effect depends on
   whether any of the Tools and/or Builders that use the variable have
   been included in the construction environment.

   In this appendix, we have appended the initial $ (dollar sign) to the
   beginning of each variable name when it appears in the text, but left
   off the dollar sign in the left-hand column where the name appears for
   each entry.

   AR
          The static library archiver.

   ARCHITECTURE
          Specifies the system architecture for which the package is being
          built. The default is the system architecture of the machine on
          which SCons is running. This is used to fill in the
          Architecture: field in an Ipkg control file, and as part of the
          name of a generated RPM file.

   ARCOM
          The command line used to generate a static library from object
          files.

   ARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file. If this is not set, then
          [317]$ARCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   ARFLAGS
          General options passed to the static library archiver.

   AS
          The assembler.

   ASCOM
          The command line used to generate an object file from an
          assembly-language source file.

   ASCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file. If this is not set, then
          [318]$ASCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

   ASFLAGS
          General options passed to the assembler.

   ASPPCOM
          The command line used to assemble an assembly-language source
          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. Any options specified in the [319]$ASFLAGS
          and [320]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line.

   ASPPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file after first running the file
          through the C preprocessor. If this is not set, then
          [321]$ASPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASPPCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

   ASPPFLAGS
          General options when an assembling an assembly-language source
          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. The default is to use the value of
          [322]$ASFLAGS.

   BIBTEX
          The bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter
          and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   BIBTEXCOM
          The command line used to call the bibliography generator for the
          TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter.

   BIBTEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a bibliography for TeX or
          LaTeX. If this is not set, then [323]$BIBTEXCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(BIBTEXCOMSTR = "Generating bibliography $TARGET")

   BIBTEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the bibliography generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   BITKEEPER
          The BitKeeper executable.

   BITKEEPERCOM
          The command line for fetching source files using BitKeeper.

   BITKEEPERCOMSTR
          The string displayed when fetching a source file using
          BitKeeper. If this is not set, then [324]$BITKEEPERCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   BITKEEPERGET
          The command ([325]$BITKEEPER) and subcommand for fetching source
          files using BitKeeper.

   BITKEEPERGETFLAGS
          Options that are passed to the BitKeeper get subcommand.

   BUILDERS
          A dictionary mapping the names of the builders available through
          this environment to underlying Builder objects. Builders named
          Alias, CFile, CXXFile, DVI, Library, Object, PDF, PostScript,
          and Program are available by default. If you initialize this
          variable when an Environment is created:

env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'NewBuilder' : foo})

          the default Builders will no longer be available. To use a new
          Builder object in addition to the default Builders, add your new
          Builder object like this:

env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'NewBuilder' : foo})

          or this:

env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS]['NewBuilder'] = foo

   CC
          The C compiler.

   CCCOM
          The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static)
          object file. Any options specified in the [326]$CFLAGS,
          [327]$CCFLAGS and [328]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are
          included on this command line.

   CCCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a C source file is compiled to a
          (static) object file. If this is not set, then [329]$CCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CCFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C and C++ compilers.

   CCPCHFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support building
          with precompiled headers. The default value expands expands to
          the appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options when
          the [330]$PCH construction variable is set.

   CCPDBFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support storing
          debugging information in a Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file. The
          default value expands expands to appropriate Microsoft Visual
          C++ command-line options when the [331]$PDB construction
          variable is set.

          The Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by default to
          generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with
          parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in
          the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single
          PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only
          way to get debug information embedded into a static library.
          Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance,
          although parallel builds will no longer work.

          You can generate PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the
          default [332]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = ['${(PDB and "/Zi /Fd%s" % File(PDB)) or ""}']

          An alternative would be to use the /Zi to put the debugging
          information in a separate .pdb file for each object file by
          overriding the [333]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = '/Zi /Fd${TARGET}.pdb'

   CCVERSION
          The version number of the C compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C compiler being used.

   CFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C source files. This is used by the internal
          CFile builder when generating C files from Lex (.l) or YACC (.y)
          input files. The default suffix, of course, is .c (lower case).
          On case-insensitive systems (like Windows), SCons also treats .C
          (upper case) files as C files.

   CFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C compiler (C only; not
          C++).

   CHANGE_SPECFILE
          A hook for modifying the file that controls the packaging build
          (the .spec for RPM, the control for Ipkg, the .wxs for MSI). If
          set, the function will be called after the SCons template for
          the file has been written. XXX

   CHANGED_SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See "Variable Substitution," below.)

   CHANGED_TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See "Variable Substitution," below.)

   CHANGELOG
          The name of a file containing the change log text to be included
          in the package. This is included as the %changelog section of
          the RPM .spec file.

   _concat
          A function used to produce variables like $_CPPINCFLAGS. It
          takes four or five arguments: a prefix to concatenate onto each
          element, a list of elements, a suffix to concatenate onto each
          element, an environment for variable interpolation, and an
          optional function that will be called to transform the list
          before concatenation.

env['_CPPINCFLAGS'] = '$( ${_concat(INCPREFIX, CPPPATH, INCSUFFIX, __env__, RDir
s)} $)',

   CONFIGUREDIR
          The name of the directory in which Configure context test files
          are written. The default is .sconf_temp in the top-level
          directory containing the SConstruct file.

   CONFIGURELOG
          The name of the Configure context log file. The default is
          config.log in the top-level directory containing the SConstruct
          file.

   _CPPDEFFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options to define values. The value
          of $_CPPDEFFLAGS is created by appending $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each definition in
          $CPPDEFINES.

   CPPDEFINES
          A platform independent specification of C preprocessor
          definitions. The definitions will be added to command lines
          through the automatically-generated $_CPPDEFFLAGS construction
          variable (see above), which is constructed according to the type
          of value of $CPPDEFINES:

          If $CPPDEFINES is a string, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be added to the
          beginning and end.

# Will add -Dxyz to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /Dxyz to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES='xyz')

          If $CPPDEFINES is a list, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be appended to the
          beginning and end of each element in the list. If any element is
          a list or tuple, then the first item is the name being defined
          and the second item is its value:

# Will add -DB=2 -DA to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DB=2 /DA to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('B', 2), 'A'])

          If $CPPDEFINES is a dictionary, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX
          and $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be appended to the
          beginning and end of each item from the dictionary. The key of
          each dictionary item is a name being defined to the dictionary
          item's corresponding value; if the value is None, then the name
          is defined without an explicit value. Note that the resulting
          flags are sorted by keyword to ensure that the order of the
          options on the command line is consistent each time scons is
          run.

# Will add -DA -DB=2 to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DA /DB=2 to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES={'B':2, 'A':None})

   CPPDEFPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify preprocessor definitions on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the beginning of
          each definition in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable when
          the $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPDEFSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify preprocessor definitions on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          definition in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable when the
          $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPFLAGS
          User-specified C preprocessor options. These will be included in
          any command that uses the C preprocessor, including not just
          compilation of C and C++ source files via the [334]$CCCOM,
          [335]$SHCCCOM, [336]$CXXCOM and [337]$SHCXXCOM command lines,
          but also the [338]$FORTRANPPCOM, [339]$SHFORTRANPPCOM,
          [340]$F77PPCOM and [341]$SHF77PPCOM command lines used to
          compile a Fortran source file, and the [342]$ASPPCOM command
          line used to assemble an assembly language source file, after
          first running each file through the C preprocessor. Note that
          this variable does not contain -I (or similar) include search
          path options that scons generates automatically from
          [343]$CPPPATH. See [344]$_CPPINCFLAGS, below, for the variable
          that expands to those options.

   _CPPINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files. The value of $_CPPINCFLAGS is
          created by appending $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX to the beginning
          and end of each directory in $CPPPATH.

   CPPPATH
          The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for
          include directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in CCFLAGS or CXXFLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          CPPPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory
          when they are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a
          directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(CPPPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(CPPPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_CPPINCFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by appending the values of the $INCPREFIX
          and $INCSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end
          of each directory in $CPPPATH. Any command lines you define that
          need the CPPPATH directory list should include $_CPPINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(CCCOM="my_compiler $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   CPPSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for C
          preprocessor implicit dependencies (#include lines). The default
          list is:

[".c", ".C", ".cxx", ".cpp", ".c++", ".cc",
 ".h", ".H", ".hxx", ".hpp", ".hh",
 ".F", ".fpp", ".FPP",
 ".m", ".mm",
 ".S", ".spp", ".SPP"]

   CVS
          The CVS executable.

   CVSCOFLAGS
          Options that are passed to the CVS checkout subcommand.

   CVSCOM
          The command line used to fetch source files from a CVS
          repository.

   CVSCOMSTR
          The string displayed when fetching a source file from a CVS
          repository. If this is not set, then [345]$CVSCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

   CVSFLAGS
          General options that are passed to CVS. By default, this is set
          to -d $CVSREPOSITORY to specify from where the files must be
          fetched.

   CVSREPOSITORY
          The path to the CVS repository. This is referenced in the
          default [346]$CVSFLAGS value.

   CXX
          The C++ compiler.

   CXXCOM
          The command line used to compile a C++ source file to an object
          file. Any options specified in the [347]$CXXFLAGS and
          [348]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line.

   CXXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a C++ source file is compiled to a
          (static) object file. If this is not set, then [349]$CXXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(CXXCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C++ source files. This is used by the internal
          CXXFile builder when generating C++ files from Lex (.ll) or YACC
          (.yy) input files. The default suffix is .cc. SCons also treats
          files with the suffixes .cpp, .cxx, .c++, and .C++ as C++ files,
          and files with .mm suffixes as Objective C++ files. On
          case-sensitive systems (Linux, UNIX, and other POSIX-alikes),
          SCons also treats .C (upper case) files as C++ files.

   CXXFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C++ compiler. By default,
          this includes the value of [350]$CCFLAGS, so that setting
          $CCFLAGS affects both C and C++ compilation. If you want to add
          C++-specific flags, you must set or override the value of
          [351]$CXXFLAGS.

   CXXVERSION
          The version number of the C++ compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C++ compiler being used.

   DESCRIPTION
          A long description of the project being packaged. This is
          included in the relevant section of the file that controls the
          packaging build.

   DESCRIPTION_lang
          A language-specific long description for the specified lang.
          This is used to populate a %description -l section of an RPM
          .spec file.

   Dir
          A function that converts a string into a Dir instance relative
          to the target being built.

   Dirs
          A function that converts a list of strings into a list of Dir
          instances relative to the target being built.

   DSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for imported
          D package files. The default list is:

['.d']

   DVIPDF
          The TeX DVI file to PDF file converter.

   DVIPDFCOM
          The command line used to convert TeX DVI files into a PDF file.

   DVIPDFCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a TeX DVI file is converted into a PDF
          file. If this is not set, then [352]$DVIPDFCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

   DVIPDFFLAGS
          General options passed to the TeX DVI file to PDF file
          converter.

   DVIPS
          The TeX DVI file to PostScript converter.

   DVIPSFLAGS
          General options passed to the TeX DVI file to PostScript
          converter.

   ENV
          A dictionary of environment variables to use when invoking
          commands. When $ENV is used in a command all list values will be
          joined using the path separator and any other non-string values
          will simply be coerced to a string. Note that, by default, scons
          does not propagate the environment in force when you execute
          scons to the commands used to build target files. This is so
          that builds will be guaranteed repeatable regardless of the
          environment variables set at the time scons is invoked.

          If you want to propagate your environment variables to the
          commands executed to build target files, you must do so
          explicitly:

import os
env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)

          Note that you can choose only to propagate certain environment
          variables. A common example is the system PATH environment
          variable, so that scons uses the same utilities as the invoking
          shell (or other process):

import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})

   ESCAPE
          A function that will be called to escape shell special
          characters in command lines. The function should take one
          argument: the command line string to escape; and should return
          the escaped command line.

   F77
          The Fortran 77 compiler. You should normally set the
          [353]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [354]$F77 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 77 files.

   F77COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 77 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [355]$F77COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 77 files. You should
          normally set the [356]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F77COMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 77 source file is compiled
          to an object file. If this is not set, then [357]$F77COM or
          [358]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F77FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F77 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f77']

   F77FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 77
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [359]$F77PATH. See [360]$_F77INCFLAGS below,
          for the variable that expands to those options. You only need to
          set [361]$F77FLAGS if you need to define specific user options
          for Fortran 77 files. You should normally set the
          [362]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F77INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 77 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [363]$_F77INCFLAGS is created by appending [364]$INCPREFIX and
          [365]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [366]$F77PATH.

   F77PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 77 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [367]$F77FLAGS because the result
          will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by
          the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in [368]$F77PATH
          will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they
          are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #: You only need to
          set [369]$F77PATH if you need to define a specific include path
          for Fortran 77 files. You should normally set the
          [370]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include path for
          the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F77PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F77PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [371]$_F77INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [372]$INCPREFIX and [373]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [374]$F77PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F77PATH directory list
          should include [375]$_F77INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F77COM="my_compiler $_F77INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F77PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 77 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [376]$F77FLAGS and
          [377]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [378]$F77PPCOM if you need to
          use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 77 files.
          You should normally set the [379]$FORTRANPPCOM variable, which
          specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F77PPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 77 source file is compiled
          to an object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [380]$F77PPCOM or
          [381]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F77PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F77 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty

          The Fortran 90 compiler. You should normally set the
          [382]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [383]$F90 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 90 files.

   F90COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 90 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [384]$F90COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 90 files. You should
          normally set the [385]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F90COMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 90 source file is compiled
          to an object file. If this is not set, then [386]$F90COM or

          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [388]$F90PATH. See [389]$_F90INCFLAGS below,
          for the variable that expands to those options. You only need to
          set [390]$F90FLAGS if you need to define specific user options
          for Fortran 90 files. You should normally set the
          [391]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F90INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 90 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [392]$_F90INCFLAGS is created by appending [393]$INCPREFIX and
          [394]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [395]$F90PATH.

   F90PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 90 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [396]$F90FLAGS because the result
          will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by
          the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in [397]$F90PATH
          will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they
          are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #: You only need to
          set [398]$F90PATH if you need to define a specific include path
          for Fortran 90 files. You should normally set the
          [399]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include path for
          the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F90PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F90PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [400]$_F90INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [401]$INCPREFIX and [402]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [403]$F90PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F90PATH directory list
          should include [404]$_F90INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F90COM="my_compiler $_F90INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F90PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 90 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [405]$F90FLAGS and
          [406]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [407]$F90PPCOM if you need to
          use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 90 files.
          You should normally set the [408]$FORTRANPPCOM variable, which

          [435]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [436]$F95PPCOM if you need to
          use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 95 files.
          You should normally set the [437]$FORTRANPPCOM variable, which
          specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F95PPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is compiled
          to an object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [438]$F95PPCOM or
          [439]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F95PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F95 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty

   File
          A function that converts a string into a File instance relative
          to the target being built.

   FORTRAN
          The default Fortran compiler for all versions of Fortran.

   FORTRANCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file. By default, any options specified in the
          [440]$FORTRANFLAGS, [441]$CPPFLAGS, [442]$_CPPDEFFLAGS,
          [443]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and [444]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variables are included on this command line.

   FORTRANCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran source file is compiled to
          an object file. If this is not set, then [445]$FORTRANCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the FORTRAN dialect will
          be used. By default, this is ['.f', '.for', '.ftn']

   FORTRANFLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include or module search path options that scons
          generates automatically from [446]$FORTRANPATH. See
          [447]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS and [448]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, below, for the
          variables that expand those options.

   _FORTRANINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files and module files. The value of
          [449]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS is created by prepending/appending
          [450]$INCPREFIX and [451]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of
          each directory in [452]$FORTRANPATH.

   FORTRANMODDIR
          Directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files it generates. This variable is empty, by default.
          Some Fortran compilers will internally append this directory in
          the search path for module files, as well.

   FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the beginning of
          the directory in the [453]$FORTRANMODDIR construction variables
          when the [454]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is automatically
          generated.

   FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the beginning of
          the directory in the [455]$FORTRANMODDIR construction variables
          when the [456]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is automatically
          generated.

   _FORTRANMODFLAG
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line option for specifying the
          directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files that happen to get generated during compilation.
          The value of [457]$_FORTRANMODFLAG is created by
          prepending/appending [458]$FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX and
          [459]$FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and end of the
          directory in [460]$FORTRANMODDIR.

   FORTRANMODPREFIX
          The module file prefix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is left empty, by default. For situations
          in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal
          convention, the user may use this variable. Its value will be
          appended to every module file name as scons attempts to resolve
          dependencies.

   FORTRANMODSUFFIX
          The module file suffix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is set to ".mod", by default. For
          situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the
          normal convention, the user may use this variable. Its value
          will be appended to every module file name as scons attempts to
          resolve dependencies.

   FORTRANPATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran compiler will search
          for include files and (for some compilers) module files. The
          Fortran implicit dependency scanner will search these
          directories for include files (but not module files since they
          are autogenerated and, as such, may not actually exist at the
          time the scan takes place). Don't explicitly put include
          directory arguments in FORTRANFLAGS because the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. Note: directory names in FORTRANPATH will be
          looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are
          used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(FORTRANPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(FORTRANPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [461]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [462]$INCPREFIX and [463]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [464]$FORTRANPATH.
          Any command lines you define that need the FORTRANPATH directory
          list should include [465]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(FORTRANCOM="my_compiler $_FORTRANINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURC
E")

   FORTRANPPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. By default, any options specified in the
          [466]$FORTRANFLAGS, [467]$CPPFLAGS, [468]$_CPPDEFFLAGS,
          [469]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and [470]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variables are included on this command line.

   FORTRANPPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran source file is compiled to
          an object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [471]$FORTRANPPCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANPPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for FORTRAN dialect will be used. By default,
          this is ['.fpp', '.FPP']

   FORTRANSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for Fortran
          implicit dependencies (INCLUDE lines and USE statements). The
          default list is:

[".f", ".F", ".for", ".FOR", ".ftn", ".FTN", ".fpp", ".FPP",
".f77", ".F77", ".f90", ".F90", ".f95", ".F95"]

   FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list containing the paths to search for
          frameworks. Used by the compiler to find framework-style
          includes like #include <Fmwk/Header.h>. Used by the linker to
          find user-specified frameworks when linking (see
          [472]$FRAMEWORKS). For example:

 env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKPATH='#myframeworkdir')

          will add

  ... -Fmyframeworkdir

          to the compiler and linker command lines.

   _FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options
          corresponding to [473]$FRAMEWORKPATH.

   FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for the
          FRAMEWORKPATH entries. (see [474]$FRAMEWORKPATH). The default
          value is -F.

   FRAMEWORKPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for linking in
          frameworks (see [475]$FRAMEWORKS). The default value is
          -framework.

   _FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options for linking
          with FRAMEWORKS.

   FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list of the framework names to be linked
          into a program or shared library or bundle. The default value is
          the empty list. For example:

 env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKS=Split('System Cocoa SystemConfiguration'))

   FRAMEWORKSFLAGS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, general user-supplied frameworks options
          to be added at the end of a command line building a loadable
          module. (This has been largely superseded by the
          [476]$FRAMEWORKPATH, [477]$FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX,
          [478]$FRAMEWORKPREFIX and [479]$FRAMEWORKS variables described
          above.)

   GS
          The Ghostscript program used to convert PostScript to PDF files.

   GSCOM
          The Ghostscript command line used to convert PostScript to PDF
          files.

   GSCOMSTR
          The string displayed when Ghostscript is used to convert a
          PostScript file to a PDF file. If this is not set, then
          [480]$GSCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   GSFLAGS
          General options passed to the Ghostscript program when
          converting PostScript to PDF files.

   HOST_ARCH
          Sets the host architecture for Visual Studio compiler. If not
          set, default to the detected host architecture: note that this
          may depend on the python you are using. This variable must be
          passed as an argument to the Environment() constructor; setting
          it later has no effect.

          Valid values are the same as for $TARGET_ARCH.

          This is currently only used on Windows, but in the future it
          will be used on other OSes as well.

   HOST_OS
          The name of the host operating system used to create the
          Environment. If a platform is specified when creating the
          Environment, then that Platform's logic will handle setting this
          value. This value is immutable, and should not be changed by the
          user after the Environment is initialized. Currently only set
          for Win32.

   IDLSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for IDL
          implicit dependencies (#include or import lines). The default
          list is:

[".idl", ".IDL"]

   IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES
          Controls whether or not SCons will add implicit dependencies for
          the commands executed to build targets.

          By default, SCons will add to each target an implicit dependency
          on the command represented by the first argument on any command
          line it executes. The specific file for the dependency is found
          by searching the PATH variable in the ENV environment used to
          execute the command.

          If the construction variable $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is
          set to a false value (None, False, 0, etc.), then the implicit
          dependency will not be added to the targets built with that
          construction environment.

env = Environment(IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES = 0)

   INCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the beginning of
          each directory in the $CPPPATH and $FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the $_CPPINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables
          are automatically generated.

   INCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          directory in the $CPPPATH and $FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the $_CPPINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables
          are automatically generated.

   INSTALL
          A function to be called to install a file into a destination
          file name. The default function copies the file into the
          destination (and sets the destination file's mode and permission
          bits to match the source file's). The function takes the
          following arguments:

def install(dest, source, env):

          dest is the path name of the destination file. source is the
          path name of the source file. env is the construction
          environment (a dictionary of construction values) in force for
          this file installation.

   INSTALLSTR
          The string displayed when a file is installed into a destination
          file name. The default is:

Install file: "$SOURCE" as "$TARGET"

   INTEL_C_COMPILER_VERSION
          Set by the "intelc" Tool to the major version number of the
          Intel C compiler selected for use.

   JAR
          The Java archive tool.

   JARCHDIR
          The directory to which the Java archive tool should change
          (using the -C option).

   JARCOM
          The command line used to call the Java archive tool.

   JARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when the Java archive tool is called If
          this is not set, then $JARCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JARCOMSTR = "JARchiving $SOURCES into $TARGET")

   JARFLAGS
          General options passed to the Java archive tool. By default this
          is set to cf to create the necessary jar file.

   JARSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java archives: .jar by default.

   JAVABOOTCLASSPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be added to the
          javac command line via the -bootclasspath option. The individual
          directory names will be separated by the operating system's path
          separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on Windows).

   JAVAC
          The Java compiler.

   JAVACCOM
          The command line used to compile a directory tree containing
          Java source files to corresponding Java class files. Any options
          specified in the [481]$JAVACFLAGS construction variable are
          included on this command line.

   JAVACCOMSTR
          The string displayed when compiling a directory tree of Java
          source files to corresponding Java class files. If this is not
          set, then [482]$JAVACCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVACCOMSTR = "Compiling class files $TARGETS from $SOURCES")

   JAVACFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the Java compiler.

   JAVACLASSDIR
          The directory in which Java class files may be found. This is
          stripped from the beginning of any Java .class file names
          supplied to the JavaH builder.

   JAVACLASSPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for Java
          .class file. The directories in this list will be added to the
          javac and javah command lines via the -classpath option. The
          individual directory names will be separated by the operating
          system's path separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on
          Windows).

          Note that this currently just adds the specified directory via
          the -classpath option. SCons does not currently search the
          $JAVACLASSPATH directories for dependency .class files.

   JAVACLASSSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java class files; .class by default.

   JAVAH
          The Java generator for C header and stub files.

   JAVAHCOM
          The command line used to generate C header and stub files from
          Java classes. Any options specified in the [483]$JAVAHFLAGS
          construction variable are included on this command line.

   JAVAHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when C header and stub files are generated
          from Java classes. If this is not set, then [484]$JAVAHCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVAHCOMSTR = "Generating header/stub file(s) $TARGETS from $S
OURCES")

   JAVAHFLAGS
          General options passed to the C header and stub file generator
          for Java classes.

   JAVASOURCEPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for
          input .java file. The directories in this list will be added to
          the javac command line via the -sourcepath option. The
          individual directory names will be separated by the operating
          system's path separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on
          Windows).

          Note that this currently just adds the specified directory via
          the -sourcepath option. SCons does not currently search the
          $JAVASOURCEPATH directories for dependency .java files.

   JAVASUFFIX
          The suffix for Java files; .java by default.

   JAVAVERSION
          Specifies the Java version being used by the Java builder. This
          is not currently used to select one version of the Java compiler
          vs. another. Instead, you should set this to specify the version
          of Java supported by your javac compiler. The default is 1.4.

          This is sometimes necessary because Java 1.5 changed the file
          names that are created for nested anonymous inner classes, which
          can cause a mismatch with the files that SCons expects will be
          generated by the javac compiler. Setting $JAVAVERSION to 1.5 (or
          1.6, as appropriate) can make SCons realize that a Java 1.5 or
          1.6 build is actually up to date.

   LATEX
          The LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   LATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter. If this is not set, then [485]$LATEXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LATEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES")

   LATEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXRETRIES
          The maximum number of times that LaTeX will be re-run if the
          .log generated by the [486]$LATEXCOM command indicates that
          there are undefined references. The default is to try to resolve
          undefined references by re-running LaTeX up to three times.

   LATEXSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for LaTeX
          implicit dependencies (\include or \import files). The default
          list is:

[".tex", ".ltx", ".latex"]

   LDMODULE
          The linker for building loadable modules. By default, this is
          the same as [487]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOM
          The command line for building loadable modules. On Mac OS X,
          this uses the [488]$LDMODULE, [489]$LDMODULEFLAGS and
          [490]$FRAMEWORKSFLAGS variables. On other systems, this is the
          same as [491]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOMSTR
          The string displayed when building loadable modules. If this is
          not set, then [492]$LDMODULECOM (the command line) is displayed.

   LDMODULEFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker for building loadable
          modules.

   LDMODULEPREFIX
          The prefix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          [493]$SHLIBPREFIX.

   LDMODULESUFFIX
          The suffix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          $SHLIBSUFFIX.

   LEX
          The lexical analyzer generator.

   LEXCOM
          The command line used to call the lexical analyzer generator to
          generate a source file.

   LEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          lexical analyzer generator. If this is not set, then
          [494]$LEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LEXCOMSTR = "Lex'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   LEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the lexical analyzer generator.

   _LIBDIRFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for library. The value of $_LIBDIRFLAGS is created by
          appending $LIBDIRPREFIX and $LIBDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and
          end of each directory in $LIBPATH.

   LIBDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the beginning of each
          directory in the $LIBPATH construction variable when the
          $_LIBDIRFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   LIBDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each directory
          in the $LIBPATH construction variable when the $_LIBDIRFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   _LIBFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying libraries to be
          linked with the resulting target. The value of $_LIBFLAGS is
          created by appending $LIBLINKPREFIX and $LIBLINKSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each filename in $LIBS.

   LIBLINKPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the beginning of each
          library in the $LIBS construction variable when the $_LIBFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBLINKSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each library
          in the $LIBS construction variable when the $_LIBFLAGS variable
          is automatically generated.

   LIBPATH
          The list of directories that will be searched for libraries. The
          implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for
          include files. Don't explicitly put include directory arguments
          in $LINKFLAGS or $SHLINKFLAGS because the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. Note: directory names in LIBPATH will be
          looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are
          used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(LIBPATH='#/libs')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

libs = Dir('libs')
env = Environment(LIBPATH=libs)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_LIBDIRFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by appending the values of the
          $LIBDIRPREFIX and $LIBDIRSUFFIX construction variables to the
          beginning and end of each directory in $LIBPATH. Any command
          lines you define that need the LIBPATH directory list should
          include $_LIBDIRFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

   LIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBPREFIXES
          A list of all legal prefixes for library file names. When
          searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files
          with these prefixes, the base library name, and suffixes in the
          $LIBSUFFIXES list.

   LIBS
          A list of one or more libraries that will be linked with any
          executable programs created by this environment.

          The library list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_LIBFLAGS construction variable, which
          is constructed by appending the values of the $LIBLINKPREFIX and
          $LIBLINKSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end
          of each filename in $LIBS. Any command lines you define that
          need the LIBS library list should include $_LIBFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

          If you add a File object to the $LIBS list, the name of that
          file will be added to $_LIBFLAGS, and thus the link line, as is,
          without $LIBLINKPREFIX or $LIBLINKSUFFIX. For example:

env.Append(LIBS=File('/tmp/mylib.so'))

          In all cases, scons will add dependencies from the executable
          program to all the libraries in this list.

   LIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBSUFFIXES
          A list of all legal suffixes for library file names. When
          searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files
          with prefixes, in the $LIBPREFIXES list, the base library name,
          and these suffixes.

   LICENSE
          The abbreviated name of the license under which this project is
          released (gpl, lpgl, bsd etc.). See
          http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical for a list of

   LINESEPARATOR
          The separator used by the Substfile and Textfile builders. This
          value is used between sources when constructing the target. It
          defaults to the current system line separator.

   LINK
          The linker.

   LINKCOM
          The command line used to link object files into an executable.

   LINKCOMSTR
          The string displayed when object files are linked into an
          executable. If this is not set, then [495]$LINKCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LINKCOMSTR = "Linking $TARGET")

   LINKFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker. Note that this
          variable should not contain -l (or similar) options for linking
          with the libraries listed in [496]$LIBS, nor -L (or similar)
          library search path options that scons generates automatically
          from [497]$LIBPATH. See [498]$_LIBFLAGS above, for the variable
          that expands to library-link options, and [499]$_LIBDIRFLAGS
          above, for the variable that expands to library search path
          options.

   M4
          The M4 macro preprocessor.

   M4COM
          The command line used to pass files through the M4 macro
          preprocessor.

   M4COMSTR
          The string displayed when a file is passed through the M4 macro
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [500]$M4COM (the command
          line) is displayed.

   M4FLAGS
          General options passed to the M4 macro preprocessor.

   MAKEINDEX
          The makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and
          the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   MAKEINDEXCOM
          The command line used to call the makeindex generator for the
          TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter.

   MAKEINDEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the makeindex generator for
          the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured
          formatter and typesetter. If this is not set, then
          [501]$MAKEINDEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   MAKEINDEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the makeindex generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   MAXLINELENGTH
          The maximum number of characters allowed on an external command
          line. On Win32 systems, link lines longer than this many
          characters are linked via a temporary file name.

   MIDL
          The Microsoft IDL compiler.

   MIDLCOM
          The command line used to pass files to the Microsoft IDL
          compiler.

   MIDLCOMSTR
          The string displayed when the Microsoft IDL copmiler is called.
          If this is not set, then [502]$MIDLCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   MIDLFLAGS
          General options passed to the Microsoft IDL compiler.

   MSSDK_DIR
          The directory containing the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK
          or Windows SDK) to be used for compilation.

   MSSDK_VERSION
          The version string of the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK or
          Windows SDK) to be used for compilation. Supported versions
          include 6.1, 6.0A, 6.0, 2003R2 and 2003R1.

   MSVC_BATCH
          When set to any true value, specifies that SCons should batch
          compilation of object files when calling the Microsoft Visual
          C/C++ compiler. All compilations of source files from the same
          source directory that generate target files in a same output
          directory and were configured in SCons using the same
          construction environment will be built in a single call to the
          compiler. Only source files that have changed since their object
          files were built will be passed to each compiler invocation (via
          the [503]$CHANGED_SOURCES construction variable). Any
          compilations where the object (target) file base name (minus the
          .obj) does not match the source file base name will be compiled
          separately.

   MSVC_USE_SCRIPT
          Use a batch script to set up Microsoft Visual Studio compiler

          $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT overrides $MSVC_VERSION and $TARGET_ARCH. If
          set to the name of a Visual Studio .bat file (e.g. vcvars.bat),
          SCons will run that bat file and extract the relevant variables
          from the result (typically %INCLUDE%, %LIB%, and %PATH%).
          Setting MSVC_USE_SCRIPT to None bypasses the Visual Studio
          autodetection entirely; use this if you are running SCons in a
          Visual Studio cmd window and importing the shell's environment
          variables.

   MSVC_VERSION
          Sets the preferred version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ to use.

          If $MSVC_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the
          latest version of Visual C/C++ installed on your system. If the
          specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will
          fail. This variable must be passed as an argument to the
          Environment() constructor; setting it later has no effect. Set
          it to an unexpected value (e.g. "XXX") to see the valid values
          on your system.

   MSVS
          When the Microsoft Visual Studio tools are initialized, they set
          up this dictionary with the following keys:

          VERSION: the version of MSVS being used (can be set via
          [504]$MSVS_VERSION)

          VERSIONS: the available versions of MSVS installed

          VCINSTALLDIR: installed directory of Visual C++

          VSINSTALLDIR: installed directory of Visual Studio

          FRAMEWORKDIR: installed directory of the .NET framework

          FRAMEWORKVERSIONS: list of installed versions of the .NET
          framework, sorted latest to oldest.

          FRAMEWORKVERSION: latest installed version of the .NET framework

          FRAMEWORKSDKDIR: installed location of the .NET SDK.

          PLATFORMSDKDIR: installed location of the Platform SDK.

          PLATFORMSDK_MODULES: dictionary of installed Platform SDK
          modules, where the dictionary keys are keywords for the various
          modules, and the values are 2-tuples where the first is the
          release date, and the second is the version number.

          If a value isn't set, it wasn't available in the registry.

   MSVS_ARCH
          Sets the architecture for which the generated project(s) should
          build.

          The default value is x86. amd64 is also supported by SCons for
          some Visual Studio versions. Trying to set $MSVS_ARCH to an
          architecture that's not supported for a given Visual Studio
          version will generate an error.

   MSVS_PROJECT_BASE_PATH
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          solution file as the value of the
          SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection0 and
          SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection1 attributes of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section. There is no default
          value.

   MSVS_PROJECT_GUID
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          file as the value of the ProjectGUID attribute. The string is
          also placed in the SolutionUniqueID attribute of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_SCC_AUX_PATH
          The path name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccAuxPath attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. There is no
          default value.

   MSVS_SCC_LOCAL_PATH
          The path name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccLocalPath attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. The path
          name is also placed in the SccLocalPath0 and SccLocalPath1
          attributes of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of
          the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. There is no default
          value.

   MSVS_SCC_PROJECT_NAME
          The project name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccProjectName attribute. There
          is no default value.

   MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          file as the value of the SccProvider attribute. The string is
          also placed in the SccProvider1 attribute of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_VERSION
          Sets the preferred version of Microsoft Visual Studio to use.

          If $MSVS_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the
          latest version of Visual Studio installed on your system. So, if
          you have version 6 and version 7 (MSVS .NET) installed, it will
          prefer version 7. You can override this by specifying the
          MSVS_VERSION variable in the Environment initialization, setting
          it to the appropriate version ('6.0' or '7.0', for example). If
          the specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will
          fail.

          This is obsolete: use $MSVC_VERSION instead. If $MSVS_VERSION is
          set and $MSVC_VERSION is not, $MSVC_VERSION will be set
          automatically to $MSVS_VERSION. If both are set to different
          values, scons will raise an error.

   MSVSBUILDCOM
          The build command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified build targets.

   MSVSCLEANCOM
          The clean command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with the -c option to remove any specified targets.

   MSVSENCODING
          The encoding string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is encoding Windows-1252.

   MSVSPROJECTCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files.

   MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio project (DSP) files.
          The default value is .vcproj when using Visual Studio version
          7.x (.NET) or later version, and .dsp when using earlier
          versions of Visual Studio.

   MSVSREBUILDCOM
          The rebuild command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified rebuild targets.

   MSVSSCONS
          The SCons used in generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files. The default is the version of SCons being used to
          generate the project file.

   MSVSSCONSCOM
          The default SCons command used in generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project files.

   MSVSSCONSCRIPT
          The sconscript file (that is, SConstruct or SConscript file)
          that will be invoked by Visual Studio project files (through the
          [505]$MSVSSCONSCOM variable). The default is the same sconscript
          file that contains the call to MSVSProject to build the project
          file.

   MSVSSCONSFLAGS
          The SCons flags used in generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio solution
          files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio solution (DSW)
          files. The default value is .sln when using Visual Studio
          version 7.x (.NET), and .dsw when using earlier versions of
          Visual Studio.

   MWCW_VERSION
          The version number of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C compiler to
          be used.

   MWCW_VERSIONS
          A list of installed versions of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C
          compiler on this system.

   NAME
          Specfies the name of the project to package.

   no_import_lib
          When set to non-zero, suppresses creation of a corresponding
          Windows static import lib by the SharedLibrary builder when used
          with MinGW, Microsoft Visual Studio or Metrowerks. This also
          suppresses creation of an export (.exp) file when using
          Microsoft Visual Studio.

   OBJPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) object file names.

   OBJSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) object file names.

   P4
          The Perforce executable.

   P4COM
          The command line used to fetch source files from Perforce.

   P4COMSTR
          The string displayed when fetching a source file from Perforce.
          If this is not set, then [506]$P4COM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   P4FLAGS
          General options that are passed to Perforce.

   PACKAGEROOT
          Specifies the directory where all files in resulting archive
          will be placed if applicable. The default value is
          "$NAME-$VERSION".

   PACKAGETYPE
          Selects the package type to build. Currently these are
          available:

          * msi - Microsoft Installer * rpm - Redhat Package Manger * ipkg
          - Itsy Package Management System * tarbz2 - compressed tar *
          targz - compressed tar * zip - zip file * src_tarbz2 -
          compressed tar source * src_targz - compressed tar source *
          src_zip - zip file source

          This may be overridden with the "package_type" command line
          option.

   PACKAGEVERSION
          The version of the package (not the underlying project). This is
          currently only used by the rpm packager and should reflect
          changes in the packaging, not the underlying project code
          itself.

   PCH
          The Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header that will be used
          when compiling object files. This variable is ignored by tools
          other than Microsoft Visual C++. When this variable is defined
          SCons will add options to the compiler command line to cause it
          to use the precompiled header, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PCH file. Example:

env['PCH'] = 'StdAfx.pch'

   PCHCOM
          The command line used by the PCH builder to generated a
          precompiled header.

   PCHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a precompiled header. If
          this is not set, then [507]$PCHCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   PCHPDBFLAGS
          A construction variable that, when expanded, adds the /yD flag
          to the command line only if the $PDB construction variable is
          set.

   PCHSTOP
          This variable specifies how much of a source file is
          precompiled. This variable is ignored by tools other than
          Microsoft Visual C++, or when the PCH variable is not being
          used. When this variable is define it must be a string that is
          the name of the header that is included at the end of the
          precompiled portion of the source files, or the empty string if
          the "#pragma hrdstop" construct is being used:

env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'

   PDB
          The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging
          information for object files, shared libraries, and programs.
          This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual
          C++. When this variable is defined SCons will add options to the
          compiler and linker command line to cause them to generate
          external debugging information, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PDB file. Example:

env['PDB'] = 'hello.pdb'

          The Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default to
          generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with
          parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in
          the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single
          PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only
          way to get debug information embedded into a static library.
          Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance,
          although parallel builds will no longer work. You can generate
          PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the default
          [508]$CCPDBFLAGS variable; see the entry for that variable for
          specific examples.

   PDFCOM
          A deprecated synonym for [509]$DVIPDFCOM.

   PDFLATEX
          The pdflatex utility.

   PDFLATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the pdflatex utility.

   PDFLATEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the pdflatex utility. If this
          is not set, then [510]$PDFLATEXCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

env = Environment(PDFLATEX;COMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES"
)

   PDFLATEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the pdflatex utility.

   PDFPREFIX
          The prefix used for PDF file names.

   PDFSUFFIX
          The suffix used for PDF file names.

   PDFTEX
          The pdftex utility.

   PDFTEXCOM
          The command line used to call the pdftex utility.

   PDFTEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the pdftex utility. If this is
          not set, then [511]$PDFTEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(PDFTEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

   PDFTEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the pdftex utility.

   PKGCHK
          On Solaris systems, the package-checking program that will be
          used (along with $PKGINFO) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is /usr/sbin/pgkchk.

   PKGINFO
          On Solaris systems, the package information program that will be
          used (along with $PKGCHK) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is pkginfo.

   PLATFORM
          The name of the platform used to create the Environment. If no
          platform is specified when the Environment is created, scons
          autodetects the platform.

env = Environment(tools = [])
if env['PLATFORM'] == 'cygwin':
    Tool('mingw')(env)
else:
    Tool('msvc')(env)

   PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC
          A Python function used to print the command lines as they are
          executed (assuming command printing is not disabled by the -q or
          -s options or their equivalents). The function should take four
          arguments: s, the command being executed (a string), target, the
          target being built (file node, list, or string name(s)), source,
          the source(s) used (file node, list, or string name(s)), and
          env, the environment being used.

          The function must do the printing itself. The default
          implementation, used if this variable is not set or is None, is:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
  sys.stdout.write(s + "\n")

          Here's an example of a more interesting function:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
   sys.stdout.write("Building %s -> %s...\n" %
    (' and '.join([str(x) for x in source]),
     ' and '.join([str(x) for x in target])))
env=Environment(PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC=print_cmd_line)
env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

          This just prints "Building targetname from sourcename..."
          instead of the actual commands. Such a function could also log
          the actual commands to a log file, for example.

   PROGPREFIX
          The prefix used for executable file names.

   PROGSUFFIX
          The suffix used for executable file names.

          variable.

   QT_DEBUG
          Prints lots of debugging information while scanning for moc
          files.

   QT_LIB
          Default value is 'qt'. You may want to set this to 'qt-mt'.

   QTDIR
          The qt tool tries to take this from os.environ. It also
          initializes all QT_* construction variables listed below. (Note
          that all paths are constructed with python's os.path.join()
          method, but are listed here with the '/' separator for easier
          reading.) In addition, the construction environment variables
          [526]$CPPPATH, [527]$LIBPATH and [528]$LIBS may be modified and
          the variables PROGEMITTER, SHLIBEMITTER and LIBEMITTER are
          modified. Because the build-performance is affected when using
          this tool, you have to explicitly specify it at Environment
          creation:

Environment(tools=['default','qt'])

          The qt tool supports the following operations:

          Automatic moc file generation from header files. You do not have
          to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you.
          However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header
          file must have the same filebase as your implementation file and
          must stay in the same directory. It must have one of the
          suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You can turn off automatic moc
          file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0. See also the
          corresponding builder method .B Moc()

          Automatic moc file generation from cxx files. As stated in the
          qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of the cxx
          file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated
          by the transformation
          ${QT_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
          <basename>.moc. A warning is generated after building the moc
          file, if you do not include the correct file. If you are using
          VariantDir, you may need to specify duplicate=1. You can turn
          off automatic moc file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0.
          See also the corresponding Moc builder method.

          Automatic handling of .ui files. The implementation files
          generated from .ui files are handled much the same as yacc or
          lex files. Each .ui file given as a source of Program, Library
          or SharedLibrary will generate three files, the declaration
          file, the implementation file and a moc file. Because there are
          also generated headers, you may need to specify duplicate=1 in
          calls to VariantDir. See also the corresponding Uic builder
          method.

          $RPATHPREFIX and $RPATHSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each
          directory in $RPATH.

   RPATH
          A list of paths to search for shared libraries when running
          programs. Currently only used in the GNU (gnulink), IRIX
          (sgilink) and Sun (sunlink) linkers. Ignored on platforms and
          toolchains that don't support it. Note that the paths added to
          RPATH are not transformed by scons in any way: if you want an
          absolute path, you must make it absolute yourself.

   RPATHPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared
          libraries when running programs. This will be appended to the
          beginning of each directory in the $RPATH construction variable
          when the $_RPATH variable is automatically generated.

   RPATHSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared

   SCANNERS
          A list of the available implicit dependency scanners. New file
          scanners may be added by appending to this list, although the
          more flexible approach is to associate scanners with a specific
          Builder. See the sections "Builder Objects" and "Scanner

          [588]$SHF95PPCOM if you need to use a specific C-preprocessor
          command line for Fortran 95 files. You should normally set the
          [589]$SHFORTRANPPCOM variable, which specifies the default

   SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See "Variable Substitution," below.)

   SPAWN
          A command interpreter function that will be called to execute
          command line strings. The function must expect the following
          arguments:

def spawn(shell, escape, cmd, args, env):

          sh is a string naming the shell program to use. escape is a
          function that can be called to escape shell special characters
          in the command line. cmd is the path to the command to be
          executed. args is the arguments to the command. env is a
          dictionary of the environment variables in which the command
          should be executed.

   SUBST_DICT
          The dictionary used by the Substfile or Textfile builders for
          substitution values. It can be anything acceptable to the dict()
          constructor, so in addition to a dictionary, lists of tuples are
          also acceptable.

   SUBSTFILEPREFIX
          The prefix used for Substfile file names, the null string by
          default.

   SUBSTFILESUFFIX
          The suffix used for Substfile file names, the null string by
          default.

          fill in the Summary: field in the controlling information for
          Ipkg and RPM packages, and as the Description: field in MSI
          packages.

   SWIG
          The scripting language wrapper and interface generator.

   SWIGCFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C source files
          generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface
          generator. The default value is _wrap[601]$CFILESUFFIX. By
          default, this value is used whenever the -c++ option is not
          specified as part of the [602]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGCOM
          The command line used to call the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generator.

   SWIGCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the scripting language wrapper
          and interface generator. If this is not set, then [603]$SWIGCOM
          (the command line) is displayed.

   SWIGCXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ source files
          generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface
          generator. The default value is _wrap[604]$CFILESUFFIX. By
          default, this value is used whenever the -c++ option is
          specified as part of the [605]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGDIRECTORSUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ header files
          generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface
          generator. These are only generated for C++ code when the SWIG
          'directors' feature is turned on. The default value is _wrap.h.

   SWIGFLAGS
          General options passed to the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generator. This is where you should set -python,
          -perl5, -tcl, or whatever other options you want to specify to
          SWIG. If you set the -c++ option in this variable, scons will,
          by default, generate a C++ intermediate source file with the
          extension that is specified as the [606]$CXXFILESUFFIX variable.

   _SWIGINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          SWIG command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for included files. The value of $_SWIGINCFLAGS is
          created by appending $SWIGINCPREFIX and $SWIGINCSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each directory in $SWIGPATH.

   SWIGINCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be appended to the beginning of each
          directory in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the
          $_SWIGINCFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGINCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each directory
          in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the $_SWIGINCFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGOUTDIR
          Specifies the output directory in which the scripting language
          wrapper and interface generator should place generated
          language-specific files. This will be used by SCons to identify
          the files that will be generated by the swig call, and
          translated into the swig -outdir option on the command line.

   SWIGPATH
          The list of directories that the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generate will search for included files. The SWIG
          implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for
          include files. The default is to use the same path specified as
          $CPPPATH.

          Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in SWIGFLAGS;
          the result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          SWIGPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory
          when they are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a
          directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(SWIGPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(SWIGPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_SWIGINCFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by appending the values of the
          $SWIGINCPREFIX and $SWIGINCSUFFIX construction variables to the
          beginning and end of each directory in $SWIGPATH. Any command
          lines you define that need the SWIGPATH directory list should
          include $_SWIGINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(SWIGCOM="my_swig -o $TARGET $_SWIGINCFLAGS $SORUCES")

          The version number of the SWIG tool.

   TAR
          The tar archiver.

          The string displayed when archiving files using the tar
          archiver. If this is not set, then [607]$TARCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   TARFLAGS
          General options passed to the tar archiver.

   TARGET
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See "Variable Substitution," below.)

   TARGET_ARCH
          Sets the target architecture for Visual Studio compiler (i.e.
          the arch of the binaries generated by the compiler). If not set,
          default to $HOST_ARCH, or, if that is unset, to the architecture
          of the running machine's OS (note that the python build or
          architecture has no effect). This variable must be passed as an
          argument to the Environment() constructor; setting it later has
          no effect. This is currently only used on Windows, but in the
          future it will be used on other OSes as well.

          Valid values for Windows are x86, i386 (for 32 bits); amd64,
          emt64, x86_64 (for 64 bits); and ia64 (Itanium). For example, if
          you want to compile 64-bit binaries, you would set
          TARGET_ARCH='x86_64' in your SCons environment.

   TARGET_OS
          The name of the target operating system for the compiled objects
          created by this Environment. This defaults to the value of
          HOST_OS, and the user can override it. Currently only set for
          Win32.

   TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See "Variable Substitution," below.)

   TARSUFFIX
          The suffix used for tar file names.

   TEMPFILEPREFIX
          The prefix for a temporary file used to execute lines longer
          than $MAXLINELENGTH. The default is '@'. This may be set for
          toolchains that use other values, such as '-@' for the diab
          compiler or '-via' for ARM toolchain.

   TEX
          The TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXCOM
          The command line used to call the TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the TeX formatter and
          typesetter. If this is not set, then [608]$TEXCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

   TEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXINPUTS
          List of directories that the LaTeX program will search for
          include directories. The LaTeX implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for \include and \import files.

   TEXTFILEPREFIX
          The prefix used for Textfile file names, the null string by
          default.

   TEXTFILESUFFIX
          The suffix used for Textfile file names; .txt by default.

   TOOLS
          A list of the names of the Tool specifications that are part of
          this construction environment.

   UNCHANGED_SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See "Variable Substitution," below.)

   UNCHANGED_TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See "Variable Substitution," below.)

          This is used to fill in the Serial: field in the RPM .spec file.

   X_RPM_URL
          This is used to fill in the Url: field in the RPM .spec file.

   YACC
          The parser generator.

   YACCCOM
          The command line used to call the parser generator to generate a
          source file.

   YACCCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          parser generator. If this is not set, then [614]$YACCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(YACCCOMSTR = "Yacc'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   YACCFLAGS
          General options passed to the parser generator. If
          [615]$YACCFLAGS contains a -d option, SCons assumes that the
          call will also create a .h file (if the yacc source file ends in
          a .y suffix) or a .hpp file (if the yacc source file ends in a
          .yy suffix)

   YACCHFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option is used. Note that setting this
          variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          header file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .h.

   YACCHXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C++ header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option is used. Note that setting this
          variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          header file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .hpp, except on Mac OS X, where the
          default is ${TARGET.suffix}.h. because the default bison parser
          generator just appends .h to the name of the generated C++ file.

   YACCVCGFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the file containing the VCG grammar automaton
          definition when the --graph= option is used. Note that setting
          this variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          VCG file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .vcg.

   ZIP
          The zip compression and file packaging utility.

   ZIPCOM
          The command line used to call the zip utility, or the internal
          Python function used to create a zip archive.

   ZIPCOMPRESSION
          The compression flag from the Python zipfile module used by the
          internal Python function to control whether the zip archive is
          compressed or not. The default value is zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED,
          which creates a compressed zip archive. This value has no effect
          if the zipfile module is unavailable.

   ZIPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when archiving files using the zip utility.
          If this is not set, then [616]$ZIPCOM (the command line or
          internal Python function) is displayed.

env = Environment(ZIPCOMSTR = "Zipping $TARGET")

   ZIPFLAGS
          General options passed to the zip utility.

   ZIPSUFFIX
          The suffix used for zip file names.

Appendix B. Builders

   This appendix contains descriptions of all of the Builders that are
   potentially available "out of the box" in this version of SCons.

   CFile(), env.CFile()
          Builds a C source file given a lex (.l) or yacc (.y) input file.
          The suffix specified by the [617]$CFILESUFFIX construction
          variable (.c by default) is automatically added to the target if
          it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.c
env.CFile(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.l')
# builds bar.c
env.CFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.y')

   CXXFile(), env.CXXFile()
          Builds a C++ source file given a lex (.ll) or yacc (.yy) input
          file. The suffix specified by the [618]$CXXFILESUFFIX
          construction variable (.cc by default) is automatically added to
          the target if it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'foo.cc', source = 'foo.ll')
# builds bar.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.yy')

   DVI(), env.DVI()
          Builds a .dvi file from a .tex, .ltx or .latex input file. If
          the source file suffix is .tex, scons will examine the contents
          of the file; if the string \documentclass or \documentstyle is
          found, the file is assumed to be a LaTeX file and the target is
          built by invoking the [619]$LATEXCOM command line; otherwise,
          the [620]$TEXCOM command line is used. If the file is a LaTeX
          file, the DVI builder method will also examine the contents of
          the .aux file and invoke the [621]$BIBTEX command line if the
          string bibdata is found, start [622]$MAKEINDEX to generate an
          index if a .ind file is found and will examine the contents .log
          file and re-run the [623]$LATEXCOM command if the log file says
          it is necessary.

          The suffix .dvi (hard-coded within TeX itself) is automatically
          added to the target if it is not already present. Examples:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.DVI(target = 'aaa.dvi', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.dvi
env.DVI(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.ltx')
# builds from ccc.latex
env.DVI(target = 'ccc.dvi', source = 'ccc.latex')

   Install(), env.Install()
          Installs one or more source files or directories in the
          specified target, which must be a directory. The names of the
          specified source files or directories remain the same within the
          destination directory.

env.Install('/usr/local/bin', source = ['foo', 'bar'])

   InstallAs(), env.InstallAs()
          Installs one or more source files or directories to specific
          names, allowing changing a file or directory name as part of the
          installation. It is an error if the target and source arguments
          list different numbers of files or directories.

env.InstallAs(target = '/usr/local/bin/foo',
              source = 'foo_debug')
env.InstallAs(target = ['../lib/libfoo.a', '../lib/libbar.a'],
              source = ['libFOO.a', 'libBAR.a'])

   Jar(), env.Jar()
          Builds a Java archive (.jar) file from the specified list of
          sources. Any directories in the source list will be searched for
          .class files). Any .java files in the source list will be
          compiled to .class files by calling the [624]Java Builder.

          If the [625]$JARCHDIR value is set, the jar command will change
          to the specified directory using the -C option. If $JARCHDIR is
          not set explicitly, SCons will use the top of any subdirectory
          tree in which Java .class were built by the [626]Java Builder.

          If the contents any of the source files begin with the string
          Manifest-Version, the file is assumed to be a manifest and is
          passed to the jar command with the m option set.

env.Jar(target = 'foo.jar', source = 'classes')

env.Jar(target = 'bar.jar',
        source = ['bar1.java', 'bar2.java'])

   Java(), env.Java()
          Builds one or more Java class files. The sources may be any
          combination of explicit .java files, or directory trees which
          will be scanned for .java files.

          SCons will parse each source .java file to find the classes
          (including inner classes) defined within that file, and from
          that figure out the target .class files that will be created.
          The class files will be placed underneath the specified target
          directory.

          SCons will also search each Java file for the Java package name,
          which it assumes can be found on a line beginning with the
          string package in the first column; the resulting .class files
          will be placed in a directory reflecting the specified package
          name. For example, the file Foo.java defining a single public
          Foo class and containing a package name of sub.dir will generate
          a corresponding sub/dir/Foo.class class file.

          Examples:

env.Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['src1', 'src2'])
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['File1.java', 'File2.java'])

          Java source files can use the native encoding for the underlying
          OS. Since SCons compiles in simple ASCII mode by default, the
          compiler will generate warnings about unmappable characters,
          which may lead to errors as the file is processed further. In
          this case, the user must specify the LANG environment variable
          to tell the compiler what encoding is used. For portibility,
          it's best if the encoding is hard-coded so that the compile will
          work if it is done on a system with a different encoding.

env = Environment()
env['ENV']['LANG'] = 'en_GB.UTF-8'

   JavaH(), env.JavaH()
          Builds C header and source files for implementing Java native
          methods. The target can be either a directory in which the
          header files will be written, or a header file name which will
          contain all of the definitions. The source can be the names of
          .class files, the names of .java files to be compiled into
          .class files by calling the [627]Java builder method, or the
          objects returned from the Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [628]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the JavaH builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

          Examples:

# builds java_native.h
classes = env.Java(target = 'classdir', source = 'src')
env.JavaH(target = 'java_native.h', source = classes)

# builds include/package_foo.h and include/package_bar.h
env.JavaH(target = 'include',
          source = ['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'])

# builds export/foo.h and export/bar.h
env.JavaH(target = 'export',
          source = ['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
          JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes')

   Library(), env.Library()
          A synonym for the StaticLibrary builder method.

   LoadableModule(), env.LoadableModule()
          On most systems, this is the same as SharedLibrary. On Mac OS X
          (Darwin) platforms, this creates a loadable module bundle.

   M4(), env.M4()
          Builds an output file from an M4 input file. This uses a default
          [629]$M4FLAGS value of -E, which considers all warnings to be
          fatal and stops on the first warning when using the GNU version
          of m4. Example:

env.M4(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.c.m4')

   Moc(), env.Moc()
          Builds an output file from a moc input file. Moc input files are
          either header files or cxx files. This builder is only available
          after using the tool 'qt'. See the [630]$QTDIR variable for more
          information. Example:

env.Moc('foo.h') # generates moc_foo.cc
env.Moc('foo.cpp') # generates foo.moc

   MSVSProject(), env.MSVSProject()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio project file, and by default
          builds a solution file as well.

          This builds a Visual Studio project file, based on the version
          of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [631]$MSVS_VERSION in the
          Environment constructor). For Visual Studio 6, it will generate
          a .dsp file. For Visual Studio 7 (.NET) and later versions, it
          will generate a .vcproj file.

          By default, this also generates a solution file for the
          specified project, a .dsw file for Visual Studio 6 or a .sln
          file for Visual Studio 7 (.NET). This behavior may be disabled
          by specifying auto_build_solution=0 when you call MSVSProject,
          in which case you presumably want to build the solution file(s)
          by calling the MSVSSolution Builder (see below).

          The MSVSProject builder takes several lists of filenames to be
          placed into the project file. These are currently limited to
          srcs, incs, localincs, resources, and misc. These are pretty
          self-explanatory, but it should be noted that these lists are
          added to the [632]$SOURCES construction variable as strings, NOT
          as SCons File Nodes. This is because they represent file names
          to be added to the project file, not the source files used to
          build the project file.

          The above filename lists are all optional, although at least one
          must be specified for the resulting project file to be
          non-empty.

          In addition to the above lists of values, the following values
          may be specified:

          target: The name of the target .dsp or .vcproj file. The correct
          suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the
          [633]$MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX construction variable will be defined to
          the correct value (see example below).

          variant: The name of this particular variant. For Visual Studio
          7 projects, this can also be a list of variant names. These are
          typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really can be
          anything you want. For Visual Studio 7 projects, they may also
          specify a target platform separated from the variant name by a |
          (vertical pipe) character: Debug|Xbox. The default target
          platform is Win32. Multiple calls to MSVSProject with different
          variants are allowed; all variants will be added to the project
          file with their appropriate build targets and sources.

          buildtarget: An optional string, node, or list of strings or
          nodes (one per build variant), to tell the Visual Studio
          debugger what output target to use in what build variant. The
          number of buildtarget entries must match the number of variant
          entries.

          runfile: The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later
          will run and debug. This appears as the value of the Output
          field in the resutling Visual Studio project file. If this is
          not specified, the default is the same as the specified
          buildtarget value.

          Note that because SCons always executes its build commands from
          the directory in which the SConstruct file is located, if you
          generate a project file in a different directory than the
          SConstruct directory, users will not be able to double-click on
          the file name in compilation error messages displayed in the
          Visual Studio console output window. This can be remedied by
          adding the Visual C/C++ .B /FC compiler option to the
          [634]$CCFLAGS variable so that the compiler will print the full
          path name of any files that cause compilation errors.

          Example usage:

barsrcs = ['bar.cpp'],
barincs = ['bar.h'],
barlocalincs = ['StdAfx.h']
barresources = ['bar.rc','resource.h']
barmisc = ['bar_readme.txt']

dll = env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar.dll',
                        source = barsrcs)

env.MSVSProject(target = 'Bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX'],
                srcs = barsrcs,
                incs = barincs,
                localincs = barlocalincs,
                resources = barresources,
                misc = barmisc,
                buildtarget = dll,
                variant = 'Release')

   MSVSSolution(), env.MSVSSolution()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.

          This builds a Visual Studio solution file, based on the version
          of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [635]$MSVS_VERSION in the
          construction environment). For Visual Studio 6, it will generate
          a .dsw file. For Visual Studio 7 (.NET), it will generate a .sln
          file.

          The following values must be specified:

          target: The name of the target .dsw or .sln file. The correct
          suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the
          value [636]$MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX will be defined to the correct
          value (see example below).

          variant: The name of this particular variant, or a list of
          variant names (the latter is only supported for MSVS 7
          solutions). These are typically things like "Debug" or
          "Release", but really can be anything you want. For MSVS 7 they
          may also specify target platform, like this "Debug|Xbox".
          Default platform is Win32.

          projects: A list of project file names, or Project nodes
          returned by calls to the MSVSProject Builder, to be placed into
          the solution file. It should be noted that these file names are
          NOT added to the $SOURCES environment variable in form of files,
          but rather as strings. This is because they represent file names
          to be added to the solution file, not the source files used to
          build the solution file.

          (NOTE: Currently only one project is supported per solution.)

          Example Usage:

env.MSVSSolution(target = 'Bar' + env['MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX'],
                 projects = ['bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX']],
                 variant = 'Release')

   Object(), env.Object()
          A synonym for the StaticObject builder method.

   Package(), env.Package()
          Builds software distribution packages. Packages consist of files
          to install and packaging information. The former may be
          specified with the source parameter and may be left out, in
          which case the FindInstalledFiles function will collect all
          files that have an Install or InstallAs Builder attached. If the
          target is not specified it will be deduced from additional
          information given to this Builder.

          The packaging information is specified with the help of
          construction variables documented below. This information is
          called a tag to stress that some of them can also be attached to
          files with the Tag function. The mandatory ones will complain if
          they were not specified. They vary depending on chosen target
          packager.

          The target packager may be selected with the "PACKAGETYPE"
          command line option or with the $PACKAGETYPE construction
          variable. Currently the following packagers available:

          * msi - Microsoft Installer * rpm - Redhat Package Manger * ipkg
          - Itsy Package Management System * tarbz2 - compressed tar *
          targz - compressed tar * zip - zip file * src_tarbz2 -
          compressed tar source * src_targz - compressed tar source *
          src_zip - zip file source

          An updated list is always available under the "package_type"
          option when running "scons --help" on a project that has
          packaging activated.

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'packaging'])
env.Install('/bin/', 'my_program')
env.Package( NAME           = 'foo',
             VERSION        = '1.2.3',
             PACKAGEVERSION = 0,
             PACKAGETYPE    = 'rpm',
             LICENSE        = 'gpl',
             SUMMARY        = 'balalalalal',
             DESCRIPTION    = 'this should be really really long',
             X_RPM_GROUP    = 'Application/fu',
             SOURCE_URL     = 'http://foo.org/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz'
        )

   PCH(), env.PCH()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header. Calling this
          builder method returns a list of two targets: the PCH as the
          first element, and the object file as the second element.
          Normally the object file is ignored. This builder method is only
          provided when Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the
          compiler. The PCH builder method is generally used in conjuction
          with the PCH construction variable to force object files to use
          the precompiled header:

env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]

   PDF(), env.PDF()
          Builds a .pdf file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [637]$PDFSUFFIX construction variable (.pdf by default) is added
          automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PDF(target = 'aaa.pdf', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.pdf from bbb.dvi
env.PDF(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   PostScript(), env.PostScript()
          Builds a .ps file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [638]$PSSUFFIX construction variable (.ps by default) is added
          automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PostScript(target = 'aaa.ps', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.ps from bbb.dvi
env.PostScript(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   Program(), env.Program()
          Builds an executable given one or more object files or C, C++,
          D, or Fortran source files. If any C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files are specified, then they will be automatically compiled to
          object files using the Object builder method; see that builder
          method's description for a list of legal source file suffixes
          and how they are interpreted. The target executable file prefix
          (specified by the [639]$PROGPREFIX construction variable;
          nothing by default) and suffix (specified by the
          [640]$PROGSUFFIX construction variable; by default, .exe on
          Windows systems, nothing on POSIX systems) are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.Program(target = 'foo', source = ['foo.o', 'bar.c', 'baz.f'])

   RES(), env.RES()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ resource file. This builder method
          is only provided when Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW is being
          used as the compiler. The .res (or .o for MinGW) suffix is added
          to the target name if no other suffix is given. The source file
          is scanned for implicit dependencies as though it were a C file.
          Example:

env.RES('resource.rc')

   RMIC(), env.RMIC()
          Builds stub and skeleton class files for remote objects from
          Java .class files. The target is a directory relative to which
          the stub and skeleton class files will be written. The source
          can be the names of .class files, or the objects return from the
          Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [641]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the RMIC builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

classes = env.Java(target = 'classdir', source = 'src')
env.RMIC(target = 'outdir1', source = classes)

env.RMIC(target = 'outdir2',
         source = ['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'])

env.RMIC(target = 'outdir3',
         source = ['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
         JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes')

   RPCGenClient(), env.RPCGenClient()
          Generates an RPC client stub (_clnt.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_clnt.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenHeader(), env.RPCGenHeader()
          Generates an RPC header (.h) file from a specified RPC (.x)
          source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif.h
env.RPCGenHeader('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenService(), env.RPCGenService()
          Generates an RPC server-skeleton (_svc.c) file from a specified
          RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in
          the local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_svc.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenXDR(), env.RPCGenXDR()
          Generates an RPC XDR routine (_xdr.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_xdr.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   SharedLibrary(), env.SharedLibrary()
          Builds a shared library (.so on a POSIX system, .dll on Windows)
          given one or more object files or C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files. If any source files are given, then they will be
          automatically compiled to object files. The static library
          prefix and suffix (if any) are automatically added to the
          target. The target library file prefix (specified by the
          [642]$SHLIBPREFIX construction variable; by default, lib on
          POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems) and suffix (specified
          by the [643]$SHLIBSUFFIX construction variable; by default, .dll
          on Windows systems, .so on POSIX systems) are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          On Windows systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always
          build an import (.lib) library in addition to the shared (.dll)
          library, adding a .lib library with the same basename if there
          is not already a .lib file explicitly listed in the targets.

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          shared library (that is, using the SharedObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

          On some platforms, there is a distinction between a shared
          library (loaded automatically by the system to resolve external
          references) and a loadable module (explicitly loaded by user
          action). For maximum portability, use the LoadableModule builder
          for the latter.

          On Windows systems, specifying register=1 will cause the .dll to
          be registered after it is built using REGSVR32. The command that
          is run ("regsvr32" by default) is determined by [644]$REGSVR
          construction variable, and the flags passed are determined by
          [645]$REGSVRFLAGS. By default, [646]$REGSVRFLAGS includes the /s
          option, to prevent dialogs from popping up and requiring user
          attention when it is run. If you change [647]$REGSVRFLAGS, be
          sure to include the /s option. For example,

env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar',
                  source = ['bar.cxx', 'foo.obj'],
                  register=1)

          will register bar.dll as a COM object when it is done linking
          it.

   SharedObject(), env.SharedObject()
          Builds an object file for inclusion in a shared library. Source
          files must have one of the same set of extensions specified
          above for the StaticObject builder method. On some platforms
          building a shared object requires additional compiler option
          (e.g. -fPIC for gcc) in addition to those needed to build a
          normal (static) object, but on some platforms there is no
          difference between a shared object and a normal (static) one.
          When there is a difference, SCons will only allow shared objects
          to be linked into a shared library, and will use a different
          suffix for shared objects. On platforms where there is no
          difference, SCons will allow both normal (static) and shared
          objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use the
          same suffix for shared and normal (static) objects. The target
          object file prefix (specified by the [648]$SHOBJPREFIX
          construction variable; by default, the same as [649]$OBJPREFIX)
          and suffix (specified by the [650]$SHOBJSUFFIX construction
          variable) are automatically added to the target if not already
          present. Examples:

env.SharedObject(target = 'ddd', source = 'ddd.c')
env.SharedObject(target = 'eee.o', source = 'eee.cpp')
env.SharedObject(target = 'fff.obj', source = 'fff.for')

          Note that the source files will be scanned according to the
          suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner object. See the section
          "Scanner Objects," below, for more information.

   StaticLibrary(), env.StaticLibrary()
          Builds a static library given one or more object files or C,
          C++, D or Fortran source files. If any source files are given,
          then they will be automatically compiled to object files. The
          static library prefix and suffix (if any) are automatically
          added to the target. The target library file prefix (specified
          by the [651]$LIBPREFIX construction variable; by default, lib on
          POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems) and suffix (specified
          by the [652]$LIBSUFFIX construction variable; by default, .lib
          on Windows systems, .a on POSIX systems) are automatically added
          to the target if not already present. Example:

env.StaticLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          static library (that is, using the StaticObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

   StaticObject(), env.StaticObject()
          Builds a static object file from one or more C, C++, D, or
          Fortran source files. Source files must have one of the
          following extensions:

  .asm    assembly language file
  .ASM    assembly language file
  .c      C file
  .C      Windows:  C file
          POSIX:  C++ file
  .cc     C++ file
  .cpp    C++ file
  .cxx    C++ file
  .cxx    C++ file
  .c++    C++ file
  .C++    C++ file
  .d      D file
  .f      Fortran file
  .F      Windows:  Fortran file
          POSIX:  Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .for    Fortran file
  .FOR    Fortran file
  .fpp    Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .FPP    Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .m      Object C file
  .mm     Object C++ file
  .s      assembly language file
  .S      Windows:  assembly language file
          ARM: CodeSourcery Sourcery Lite
  .sx     assembly language file + C pre-processor
          POSIX:  assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .spp    assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .SPP    assembly language file + C pre-processor

          The target object file prefix (specified by the [653]$OBJPREFIX
          construction variable; nothing by default) and suffix (specified
          by the [654]$OBJSUFFIX construction variable; .obj on Windows
          systems, .o on POSIX systems) are automatically added to the
          target if not already present. Examples:

env.StaticObject(target = 'aaa', source = 'aaa.c')
env.StaticObject(target = 'bbb.o', source = 'bbb.c++')
env.StaticObject(target = 'ccc.obj', source = 'ccc.f')

          Note that the source files will be scanned according to the
          suffix mappings in SourceFileScanner object. See the section
          "Scanner Objects," below, for more information.

   Substfile(), env.Substfile()
          The Substfile builder generates a single text file by
          concatenating the source files. Nested lists of sources are
          flattened. $LINESEPARATOR is used to separate the source files;
          see the description of Textfile for details.

          If a single source file is present with an .in suffix, the
          suffix is stripped and the remainder is used as the default
          target name.

          The prefix and suffix specified by the $SUBSTFILEPREFIX and
          $SUBSTFILESUFFIX construction variables (the null string by
          default in both cases) are automatically added to the target if
          they are not already present.

          If a construction variable named $SUBST_DICT is present, it may
          be either a Python dictionary or a sequence of (key,value)
          tuples. If the former, the dictionary is converted into a list
          of tuples in an arbitrary order, so if one key is a prefix of
          another key or if one substitution could be further expanded by
          another subsitition, it is unpredictible whether the expansion
          will occur.

          Any occurences in the source of a key are replaced by the
          corresponding value, which may be a Python callable function or
          a string. If a value is a function, it is first called (with no
          arguments) to produce a string. The string is subst-expanded and
          the result replaces the key.

env = Environment(tools = ['default', 'textfile'])

env['prefix'] = '/usr/bin'
script_dict = {'@prefix@': '/bin', @exec_prefix@: '$prefix'}
env.Substfile('script.in', SUBST_DICT = script_dict)

conf_dict = {'%VERSION%': '1.2.3', '%BASE%': 'MyProg'}
env.Substfile('config.h.in', conf_dict, SUBST_DICT = conf_dict)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one key is a prefix of another
bad_foo = {'$foo': '$foo', '$foobar': '$foobar'}
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT = bad_foo)

# PREDICTABLE - keys are applied longest first
good_foo = [('$foobar', '$foobar'), ('$foo', '$foo')]
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT = good_foo)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one substitution could be futher expanded
bad_bar = {'@bar@': '@soap@', '@soap@': 'lye'}
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT = bad_bar)

# PREDICTABLE - substitutions are expanded in order
good_bar = (('@bar@', '@soap@'), ('@soap@', 'lye'))
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT = good_bar)

# the SUBST_DICT may be in common (and not an override)
substutions = {}
subst = Environment(tools = ['textfile', SUBST_DICT = substitutions)
substitutions['@foo@'] = 'foo'
subst['SUBST_DICT']['@bar@'] = 'bar'
subst.Substfile('pgm1.c', [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'),
                           Value('#include "@bar@.h"'),
                           "common.in",
                           "pgm1.in"
                          ])
subst.Substfile('pgm2.c', [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'),
                           Value('#include "@bar@.h"'),
                           "common.in",
                           "pgm2.in"
                          ])


   Tar(), env.Tar()
          Builds a tar archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Tar builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Tar('src.tar', 'src')

# Create the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', 'another')

# Set TARFLAGS to create a gzip-filtered archive.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z')
env.Tar('foo.tar.gz', 'foo')

# Also set the suffix to .tgz.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z',
                  TARSUFFIX = '.tgz')
env.Tar('foo')

   Textfile(), env.Textfile()
          The Textfile builder generates a single text file. The source
          strings constitute the lines; nested lists of sources are
          flattened. $LINESEPARATOR is used to separate the strings.

          If present, the $SUBST_DICT construction variable is used to
          modify the strings before they are written; see the Substfile
          description for details.

          The prefix and suffix specified by the $TEXTFILEPREFIX and
          $TEXTFILESUFFIX construction variables (the null string and .txt
          by default, respectively) are automatically added to the target
          if they are not already present. Examples:

# builds/writes foo.txt
env.Textfile(target = 'foo.txt', source = ['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'])

# builds/writes bar.txt
env.Textfile(target = 'bar',
             source = ['lalala', 'tanteratei'],
             LINESEPARATOR='|*')

# nested lists are flattened automatically
env.Textfile(target = 'blob',
             source = ['lalala', ['Goethe', 42 'Schiller'], 'tanteratei'])

# files may be used as input by wraping them in File()
env.Textfile(target = 'concat',  # concatenate files with a marker between
             source = [File('concat1'), File('concat2')],
             LINESEPARATOR = '====================\n')

Results are:
foo.txt
  ....8<----
  Goethe
  42
  Schiller
  ....8<---- (no linefeed at the end)

bar.txt:
  ....8<----
  lalala|*tanteratei
  ....8<---- (no linefeed at the end)

blob.txt
  ....8<----
  lalala
  Goethe
  42
  Schiller
  tanteratei
  ....8<---- (no linefeed at the end)

   TypeLibrary(), env.TypeLibrary()
          Builds a Windows type library (.tlb) file from an input IDL file
          (.idl). In addition, it will build the associated inteface stub
          and proxy source files, naming them according to the base name
          of the .idl file. For example,

env.TypeLibrary(source="foo.idl")

          Will create foo.tlb, foo.h, foo_i.c, foo_p.c and foo_data.c
          files.

   Uic(), env.Uic()
          Builds a header file, an implementation file and a moc file from
          an ui file. and returns the corresponding nodes in the above
          order. This builder is only available after using the tool 'qt'.
          Note: you can specify .ui files directly as source files to the
          Program, Library and SharedLibrary builders without using this
          builder. Using this builder lets you override the standard
          naming conventions (be careful: prefixes are always prepended to
          names of built files; if you don't want prefixes, you may set
          them to ``). See the [655]$QTDIR variable for more information.
          Example:

env.Uic('foo.ui') # -> ['foo.h', 'uic_foo.cc', 'moc_foo.cc']
env.Uic(target = Split('include/foo.h gen/uicfoo.cc gen/mocfoo.cc'),
        source = 'foo.ui') # -> ['include/foo.h', 'gen/uicfoo.cc', 'gen/mocfoo.c
c']

   Zip(), env.Zip()
          Builds a zip archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Zip builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Zip('src.zip', 'src')

# Create the stuff.zip file.
env.Zip('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Zip('stuff', 'another')

Appendix D. Handling Common Tasks

   There is a common set of simple tasks that many build configurations
   rely on as they become more complex. Most build tools have special
   purpose constructs for performing these tasks, but since SConscript
   files are Python scripts, you can use more flexible built-in Python
   services to perform these tasks. This appendix lists a number of these
   tasks and how to implement them in Python.

   Example D-1. Wildcard globbing to create a list of filenames
files = Glob(wildcard)

   Example D-2. Filename extension substitution
import os.path
filename = os.path.splitext(filename)[0]+extension

   Example D-3. Appending a path prefix to a list of filenames
import os.path
filenames = [os.path.join(prefix, x) for x in filenames]

   Example D-4. Substituting a path prefix with another one
if filename.find(old_prefix) == 0:
    filename = filename.replace(old_prefix, new_prefix)

   Example D-5. Filtering a filename list to exclude/retain only a
   specific set of extensions
import os.path
filenames = [x for x in filenames if os.path.splitext(x)[1] in extensions]

   Example D-6. The "backtick function": run a shell command and capture
   the output
import os
output = os.popen(command).read()

  Notes

   [1355][1]

   In programming parlance, the SConstruct file is declarative, meaning
   you tell SCons what you want done and let it figure out the order in
   which to do it, rather than strictly imperative, where you specify
   explicitly the order in which to do things.
   [1356][2]

   This easily-overlooked distinction between how SCons decides if the
   target itself must be rebuilt and how the target is then used to decide
   if a different target must be rebuilt is one of the confusing things
   that has led to the TargetSignatures and SourceSignatures functions
   being replaced by the simpler Decider function.
   [1357][3]

   The AddOption function is, in fact, implemented using a subclass of the
   optparse.OptionParser.
   [1358][4]

   Unfortunately, in the early days of SCons design, we used the name Copy
   for the function that returns a copy of the environment, otherwise that
   would be the logical choice for a Builder that copies a file or
   directory tree to a target location.
   [1359][5]

   Actually, the MD5 signature is used as the name of the file in the
   shared cache directory in which the contents are stored.
