   I'm grateful to the following people
   for their influence, knowing or not,
   on the design of <span class="application">SCons</span>:

 </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Bob Sidebotham</span></dt><dd><p>

     First, as the original author of <span class="application">Cons</span>, Bob did the real heavy
     lifting of creating the underlying model for dependency management
     and software construction, as well as implementing it in Perl.
     During the first years of <span class="application">Cons</span>' existence, Bob did a skillful
     job of integrating input and code from the first users, and
     consequently is a source of practical wisdom and insight into the
     problems of real-world software construction.  His continuing
     advice has been invaluable.

     </p></dd><dt><span class="term">The <span class="application">SCons</span> Development Team</span></dt><dd><p>

     A big round of thanks go to those brave souls who have
     gotten in on the ground floor:
     David Abrahams,
     Charles Crain,
     Steven Leblanc.
     Anthony Roach,
     and
     Steven Shaw.
     Their contributions,
     through their general knowledge of software build issues in general
     Python in particular,
     have made <span class="application">SCons</span> what it is today.

     </p></dd><dt><span class="term">The <span class="application">Cons</span> Community</span></dt><dd><p>

     The real-world build problems that the users of <span class="application">Cons</span>
     share on the <span class="command"><strong>cons-discuss</strong></span> mailing list
     have informed much of the thinking that
     has gone into the <span class="application">SCons</span> design.
     In particular,
     Rajesh Vaidheeswarran,
     the current maintainer of <span class="application">Cons</span>,
     has been a very steady influence.
     I've also picked up valuable insight from
     mailing-list participants
     Johan Holmberg,
     Damien Neil,
     Gary Oberbrunner,
     Wayne Scott,
     and Greg Spencer.

     </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Peter Miller</span></dt><dd><p>

     Peter has indirectly
     influenced two aspects of the <span class="application">SCons</span> design:

     </p><p>

     Miller's influential paper
     <em class="citetitle">Recursive Make Considered Harmful</em>
     was what led me, indirectly, to my involvement with <span class="application">Cons</span>
     in the first place.
     Experimenting with the single-Makefile approach he describes in
     <em class="citetitle">RMCH</em> led me to conclude that while it worked
     as advertised, it was not an extensible scheme.  This solidified
     my frustration with Make and led me to try <span class="application">Cons</span>, which at its
     core shares the single-process, universal-DAG model of the "RMCH"
     single-Makefile technique.

     </p><p>

     The testing framework that Miller created for his
     Aegis change management system
     changed the way I approach software development
     by providing a framework for rigorous, repeatable
     testing during development.
     It was my success at using Aegis for personal projects
     that led me to begin my involvement with <span class="application">Cons</span>
     by creating the <span class="command"><strong>cons-test</strong></span> regression suite.

     </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Stuart Stanley</span></dt><dd><p>

     An experienced Python programmer,
     Stuart provided valuable advice and insight
     into some of the more useful Python idioms at my disposal
     during the original <code class="literal">ScCons</code>; design
     for the Software Carpentry contest.

     </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Gary Holt</span></dt><dd><p>

     I don't know which came first,
     the first-round Software Carpentry contest entry
     or the tool itself,
     but Gary's design for <span class="application">Make++</span>
     showed me that it is possible to marry
     the strengths of <span class="application">Cons</span>-like dependency management
     with backwards compatibility for <code class="filename">Makefile</code>s.
     Striving to support both
     <code class="filename">Makefile</code> compatibility and
     a native Python interface
     cleaned up the <span class="application">SCons</span> design immeasurably
     by factoring out the common elements
     into the Build Engine.
