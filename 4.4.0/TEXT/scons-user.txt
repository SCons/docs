Preface

   Thank you for taking the time to read about SCons. SCons is a modern
   software construction too - a software utility for building software
   (or other files) and keeping built software up-to-date whenever the
   underlying input files change.

   The most distinctive thing about SCons is that its configuration files
   are actually scripts, written in the Python programming language. This
   is in contrast to most alternative build tools, which typically invent
   a new language to configure the build. SCons still has a learning
   curve, of course, because you have to know what functions to call to
   set up your build properly, but the underlying syntax used should be
   familiar to anyone who has ever looked at a Python script.

   Paradoxically, using Python as the configuration file format makes
   SCons easier for non-programmers to learn than the cryptic languages of
   other build tools, which are usually invented by programmers for other
   programmers. This is in no small part due to the consistency and
   readability that are hallmarks of Python. It just so happens that
   making a real, live scripting language the basis for the configuration
   files makes it a snap for more accomplished programmers to do more
   complicated things with builds, as necessary.

1. SCons Principles

   There are a few overriding principles the SCons team tries to follow in
   the design and implementation.

   Correctness
          First and foremost, by default, SCons guarantees a correct build
          even if it means sacrificing performance a little. We strive to
          guarantee the build is correct regardless of how the software
          being built is structured, how it may have been written, or how
          unusual the tools are that build it.

   Performance
          Given that the build is correct, we try to make SCons build
          software as quickly as possible. In particular, wherever we may
          have needed to slow down the default SCons behavior to guarantee
          a correct build, we also try to make it easy to speed up SCons
          through optimization options that let you trade off guaranteed
          correctness in all end cases for a speedier build in the usual
          cases.

   Convenience
          SCons tries to do as much for you out of the box as reasonable,
          including detecting the right tools on your system and using
          them correctly to build the software.

   In a nutshell, we try hard to make SCons just "do the right thing" and
   build software correctly, with a minimum of hassles.

2. How to Use this Guide

   This guide intends to coach you how to use SCons effectively and
   efficiently, by providing a range of examples and usage scenarios. As
   such it is not exactly a tutorial (as usually those build a single
   example topic from start to finish), but if you are just starting with
   SCons it is recommended you step through the first 10 chapters in
   sequence as this will give a solid grounding in the principles of
   working with SCons. If you follow that trail, you can feel free to
   initially skip sections on extending SCons, such as Writing your own
   Decider Function, and come back to those if the need arises.

   The remaining chapters cover more advanced topics that not all build
   systems will need, and can be used in more of a single-topic way, to
   read if you find you need that particular information.

   It is often useful to keep SCons man page open in a separate browser
   tab or window to refer to as a complement to this Guide, as the User
   Guide does not attempt to provide every detail. While this Guide's
   Appendices A-D do duplicate information that appears in the man page
   (this is to allow intra-document links to definitions of construction
   variables, builders, tools and environment methods to work), the rest
   of the man page is unique content.

3. A Caveat About This Guide's Completeness

   SCons is a volunteer-run open source project. As such, the SCons
   documentation isn't always completely up-to-date with all the available
   features - somehow it's almost harder to write high quality, easy to
   use documentation than it is to implement a feature in software. In
   other words, there may be a lot that SCons can do that isn't yet
   covered in this User's Guide.

   Although this User's Guide may not be as complete as it could be, the
   development process does emphasize making sure that the SCons man page
   is kept up-to-date with new features. So if you're trying to figure out
   how to do something that SCons supports but can't find enough (or any)
   information here, it would be worth your while to look at the man page
   to see if the information is covered there. And if you do, maybe you'd
   even consider contributing a section to the User's Guide so the next
   person looking for that information won't have to go through the same
   thing...?

4. Acknowledgements

   SCons would not exist without a lot of help from a lot of people, many
   of whom may not even be aware that they helped or served as
   inspiration. So in no particular order, and at the risk of leaving out
   someone:

   First and foremost, SCons owes a tremendous debt to Bob Sidebotham, the
   original author of the classic Perl-based Cons tool which Bob first
   released to the world back around 1996. Bob's work on Cons classic
   provided the underlying architecture and model of specifying a build
   configuration using a real scripting language. My real-world experience
   working on Cons informed many of the design decisions in SCons,
   including the improved parallel build support, making Builder objects
   easily definable by users, and separating the build engine from the
   wrapping interface.

   Greg Wilson was instrumental in getting SCons started as a real project
   when he initiated the Software Carpentry design competition in February
   2000. Without that nudge, marrying the advantages of the Cons classic
   architecture with the readability of Python might have just stayed no
   more than a nice idea.

   The entire SCons team have been absolutely wonderful to work with, and
   SCons would be nowhere near as useful a tool without the energy,
   enthusiasm and time people have contributed over the past few years.
   The "core team" of Chad Austin, Anthony Roach, Bill Deegan, Charles
   Crain, Steve Leblanc, Greg Noel, Gary Oberbrunner, Greg Spencer and
   Christoph Wiedemann have been great about reviewing my (and other)
   changes and catching problems before they get in the code base. Of
   particular technical note: Anthony's outstanding and innovative work on
   the tasking engine has given SCons a vastly superior parallel build
   model; Charles has been the master of the crucial Node infrastructure;
   Christoph's work on the Configure infrastructure has added crucial
   Autoconf-like functionality; and Greg has provided excellent support
   for Microsoft Visual Studio.

   Special thanks to David Snopek for contributing his underlying
   "Autoscons" code that formed the basis of Christoph's work with the
   Configure functionality. David was extremely generous in making this
   code available to SCons, given that he initially released it under the
   GPL and SCons is released under a less-restrictive MIT-style license.

   Thanks to Peter Miller for his splendid change management system,
   Aegis, which has provided the SCons project with a robust development
   methodology from day one, and which showed me how you could integrate
   incremental regression tests into a practical development cycle (years
   before eXtreme Programming arrived on the scene).

   And last, thanks to Guido van Rossum for his elegant scripting
   language, which is the basis not only for the SCons implementation, but
   for the interface itself.

5. Contact

   The best way to contact people involved with SCons, is through the
   SCons mailing lists.

   If you want to ask general questions about how to use SCons send email
   to <[235]scons-users@scons.org>.

   If you want to contact the SCons development community directly, send
   email to <[236]scons-dev@scons.org>.

   For quicker, informal questions, discussion, etc. the project operated
   a Discord server at [237]https://discord.gg/bXVpWAy and a Libera.chat
   IRC channel at [238]https://web.libera.chat/#scons (the former channel
   at irc.freenode.net is now unused). Certain discussions may also be
   moved by administrators from mailing list or chat to [239]GitHub
   Discussions for greater permanence and easier finding.

Chapter 1. Building and Installing SCons

   This chapter will take you through the basic steps of installing SCons
   on your system, and building SCons if you don't have a pre-built
   package available (or simply prefer the flexibility of building it
   yourself). Before that, however, this chapter will also describe the
   basic steps involved in installing Python on your system, in case that
   is necessary. Fortunately, both SCons and Python are very easy to
   install on almost any system, and Python already comes installed on
   many systems.

1.1. Installing Python

   Because SCons is written in Python, you need to have Python installed
   on your system to use SCons. Before you try to install Python, you
   should check to see if Python is already available on your system by
   typing python -V (capital 'V') or python --version at your system's
   command-line prompt. For Linux/Unix/MacOS/BSD type systems this looks
   like:
$ python -V
Python 3.7.1

   Note to Windows users: there are a number of different ways Python can
   be installed or invoked on Windows, it is beyond the scope of this
   guide to unravel all of them. Many will have an additional program
   called the Python launcher (described, somewhat technically, in
   [240]PEP 397): try using the command name py instead of python, if that
   is not available drop back to trying python.
C:\>py -V
Python 3.7.1

   If Python is not installed on your system, or is not findable in the
   current search path, you will see an error message stating something
   like "command not found" (on UNIX or Linux) or "'python' is not
   recognized as an internal or external command, operable progam or batch
   file" (on Windows cmd). In that case, you need to either install Python
   or fix the search path before you can install SCons.

   The canonical location for downloading Python from Python's own website
   is: [241]https://www.python.org/download. There are useful
   system-specific entries on setup and usage to be found at:
   [242]https://docs.python.org/3/using

   For Linux systems, Python is almost certainly available as a supported
   package, possibly installed by default; this is often preferred over
   installing by other means, and is easier than installing from source
   code. Many such systems have separate packages for Python 2 and Python
   3 - make sure the Python 3 package is installed, as the latest SCons
   requires it. Building from source may still be a useful option if you
   need a version that is not offered by the distribution you are using.

   SCons will work with Python 3.5 or later. If you need to install Python
   and have a choice, we recommend using the most recent Python version
   available. Newer Pythons have significant improvements that help speed
   up the performance of SCons.

1.2. Installing SCons

   The canonical way to install SCons is from the Python Package Index
   (PyPi):
% python -m pip install scons

   If you prefer not to install to the Python system location, or do not
   have privileges to do so, you can add a flag to install to a location
   specific to your own account:
% python -m pip install --user scons

   For those users using Anaconda or Miniconda, use the conda installer
   instead, so the scons install location will match the version of Python
   that system will be using. For example:
% conda install -c conda-forge scons

   SCons comes pre-packaged for installation on many Linux systems. Check
   your package installation system to see if there is an SCons package
   available. Many people prefer to install distribution-native packages
   if available, as they provide a central point for management and
   updating. During the still-ongoing Python 2 to 3 transition, some
   distributions may still have two SCons packages available, one which
   uses Python 2 and one which uses Python 3. Since the latest scons only
   runs on Python 3, to get the current version you should choose the
   Python 3 package.

   If you need a specific version of SCons that is different from the
   package available, pip has a version option or you can follow the
   instructions in the next section.

1.3. Building and Installing SCons on Any System

   If a pre-built SCons package is not available for your system, and
   installing using pip is not suitable, then you can still easily build
   and install SCons using the native Python setuptools package.

   The first step is to download either the scons-4.4.0.tar.gz or
   scons-4.4.0.zip, which are available from the SCons download page at
   [243]https://scons.org/pages/download.html.

   Unpack the archive you downloaded, using a utility like tar on Linux or
   UNIX, or WinZip on Windows. This will create a directory called
   scons-4.4.0, usually in your local directory. Then change your working
   directory to that directory and install SCons by executing the
   following commands:
# cd scons-4.4.0
# python setup.py install

   This will build SCons, install the scons script in the python which is
   used to run the setup.py's scripts directory (/usr/local/bin or
   C:\Python37\Scripts), and will install the SCons build engine in the
   corresponding library directory for the python used
   (/usr/local/lib/scons or C:\Python37\scons). Because these are system
   directories, you may need root (on Linux or UNIX) or Administrator (on
   Windows) privileges to install SCons like this.

1.3.1. Building and Installing Multiple Versions of SCons Side-by-Side

   The SCons setup.py script has some extensions that support easy
   installation of multiple versions of SCons in side-by-side locations.
   This makes it easier to download and experiment with different versions
   of SCons before moving your official build process to a new version,
   for example.

   To install SCons in a version-specific location, add the --version-lib
   option when you call setup.py:
# python setup.py install --version-lib

   This will install the SCons build engine in the /usr/lib/scons-4.4.0 or
   C:\Python27\scons-4.4.0 directory, for example.

   If you use the --version-lib option the first time you install SCons,
   you do not need to specify it each time you install a new version. The
   SCons setup.py script will detect the version-specific directory
   name(s) and assume you want to install all versions in version-specific
   directories. You can override that assumption in the future by
   explicitly specifying the --standalone-lib option.

1.3.2. Installing SCons in Other Locations

   You can install SCons in locations other than the default by specifying
   the --prefix= option:
# python setup.py install --prefix=/opt/scons

   This would install the scons script in /opt/scons/bin and the build
   engine in /opt/scons/lib/scons,

   Note that you can specify both the --prefix= and the --version-lib
   options at the same type, in which case setup.py will install the build
   engine in a version-specific directory relative to the specified
   prefix. Adding --version-lib to the above example would install the
   build engine in /opt/scons/lib/scons-4.4.0.

1.3.3. Building and Installing SCons Without Administrative Privileges

   If you don't have the right privileges to install SCons in a system
   location, simply use the --prefix= option to install it in a location
   of your choosing. For example, to install SCons in appropriate
   locations relative to the user's $HOME directory, the scons script in
   $HOME/bin and the build engine in $HOME/lib/scons, simply type:
$ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

   You may, of course, specify any other location you prefer, and may use
   the --version-lib option if you would like to install version-specific
   directories relative to the specified prefix.

   This can also be used to experiment with a newer version of SCons than
   the one installed in your system locations. Of course, the location in
   which you install the newer version of the scons script ($HOME/bin in
   the above example) must be configured in your PATH variable before the
   directory containing the system-installed version of the scons script.

Chapter 2. Simple Builds

   In this chapter, you will see several examples of very simple build
   configurations using SCons, which will demonstrate how easy it is to
   use SCons to build programs from several different programming
   languages on different types of systems.

2.1. Building Simple C / C++ Programs

   Here's the famous "Hello, World!" program in C:
int
main()
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}

   And here's how to build it using SCons. Save the code above into
   hello.c, and enter the following into a file named SConstruct:
Program('hello.c')

   This minimal configuration file gives SCons two pieces of information:
   what you want to build (an executable program), and the input file from
   which you want it built (the hello.c file). [244]Program is a builder
   method, a Python call that tells SCons that you want to build an
   executable program.

   That's it. Now run the scons command to build the program. On a
   POSIX-compliant system like Linux or UNIX, you'll see something like:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
scons: done building targets.

   On a Windows system with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, you'll see
   something like:
C:\>scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)
scons: done building targets.

   First, notice that you only need to specify the name of the source
   file, and that SCons correctly deduces the names of the object and
   executable files to be built from the base of the source file name.

   Second, notice that the same input SConstruct file, without any
   changes, generates the correct output file names on both systems:
   hello.o and hello on POSIX systems, hello.obj and hello.exe on Windows
   systems. This is a simple example of how SCons makes it extremely easy
   to write portable software builds.

   (Note that we won't provide duplicate side-by-side POSIX and Windows
   output for all of the examples in this guide; just keep in mind that,
   unless otherwise specified, any of the examples should work equally
   well on both types of systems.)

2.2. Building Object Files

   The [245]Program builder method is only one of many builder methods
   that SCons provides to build different types of files. Another is the
   [246]Object builder method, which tells SCons to build an object file
   from the specified source file:
Object('hello.c')

   Now when you run the scons command to build the program, it will build
   just the hello.o object file on a POSIX system:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
scons: done building targets.

   And just the hello.obj object file on a Windows system (with the
   Microsoft Visual C++ compiler):
C:\>scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
scons: done building targets.

2.3. Simple Java Builds

   SCons also makes building with Java extremely easy. Unlike the
   [247]Program and [248]Object builder methods, however, the [249]Java
   builder method requires that you specify the name of a destination
   directory in which you want the class files placed, followed by the
   source directory in which the .java files live:
Java('classes', 'src')

   If the src directory contains a single hello.java file, then the output
   from running the scons command would look something like this (on a
   POSIX system):
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/hello.java
scons: done building targets.

   We'll cover Java builds in more detail, including building Java archive
   (.jar) and other types of file, in [250]Chapter 24, Java Builds.

2.4. Cleaning Up After a Build

   When using SCons, it is unnecessary to add special commands or target
   names to clean up after a build. Instead, you simply use the -c or
   --clean option when you invoke SCons, and SCons removes the appropriate
   built files. So if we build our example above and then invoke scons -c
   afterwards, the output on POSIX looks like:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
scons: done building targets.
% scons -c
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Cleaning targets ...
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
scons: done cleaning targets.

   And the output on Windows looks like:
C:\>scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)
scons: done building targets.
C:\>scons -c
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Cleaning targets ...
Removed hello.obj
Removed hello.exe
scons: done cleaning targets.

   Notice that SCons changes its output to tell you that it is Cleaning
   targets ... and done cleaning targets.

2.5. The SConstruct File

   If you're used to build systems like Make you've already figured out
   that the SConstruct file is the SCons equivalent of a Makefile. That
   is, the SConstruct file is the input file that SCons reads to control
   the build.

2.5.1. SConstruct Files Are Python Scripts

   There is, however, an important difference between an SConstruct file
   and a Makefile: the SConstruct file is actually a Python script. If
   you're not already familiar with Python, don't worry. This User's Guide
   will introduce you step-by-step to the relatively small amount of
   Python you'll need to know to be able to use SCons effectively. And
   Python is very easy to learn.

   One aspect of using Python as the scripting language is that you can
   put comments in your SConstruct file using Python's commenting
   convention; that is, everything between a '#' and the end of the line
   will be ignored:
# Arrange to build the "hello" program.
Program('hello.c')    # "hello.c" is the source file.

   You'll see throughout the remainder of this Guide that being able to
   use the power of a real scripting language can greatly simplify the
   solutions to complex requirements of real-world builds.

2.5.2. SCons Functions Are Order-Independent

   One important way in which the SConstruct file is not exactly like a
   normal Python script, and is more like a Makefile, is that the order in
   which the SCons functions are called in the SConstruct file does not
   affect the order in which SCons actually builds the programs and object
   files you want it to build ^[[251]1]. In other words, when you call the
   [252]Program builder (or any other builder method), you're not telling
   SCons to build the program at that moment. Instead, you're telling
   SCons what you want accomplished, and it's up to SCons to figure out
   how to do that, and to take those steps if/when it's necessary. We'll
   learn more about how SCons decides when building or rebuilding a target
   is necessary in [253]Chapter 6, Dependencies, below.

   SCons reflects this distinction between calling a builder method like
   Program and actually building the program by printing the status
   messages that indicate when it's "just reading" the SConstruct file,
   and when it's actually building the target files. This is to make it
   clear when SCons is executing the Python statements that make up the
   SConstruct file, and when SCons is actually executing the commands or
   other actions to build the necessary files.

   Let's clarify this with an example. Python has a print function that
   prints a string of characters to the screen. If we put print calls
   around our calls to the Program builder method:
print("Calling Program('hello.c')")
Program('hello.c')
print("Calling Program('goodbye.c')")
Program('goodbye.c')
print("Finished calling Program()")

   Then when we execute SCons, we see the output from calling the print
   function in between the messages about reading the SConscript files,
   indicating that is when the Python statements are being executed:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Calling Program('hello.c')
Calling Program('goodbye.c')
Finished calling Program()
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
scons: done building targets.

   Notice that SCons built the goodbye program first, even though the
   "reading SConscript" output shows that we called Program('hello.c')
   first in the SConstruct file.

   Notice also that SCons was able to infer a lot of information from the
   two Program calls. Because hello.c and goodbye.c were recognized as
   C-language source files, it knew to build the intermediate target files
   hello.o and goodbye.o and the final files hello and goodbye It was not
   necessary to program scons beyond just calling Program.

2.6. Making the SCons Output Less Verbose

   You've already seen how SCons prints some messages about what it's
   doing, surrounding the actual commands used to build the software:
C:\>scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)
scons: done building targets.

   These messages emphasize the order in which SCons does its work: all of
   the configuration files (generically referred to as SConscript files)
   are read and executed first, and only then are the target files built.
   Among other benefits, these messages help to distinguish between errors
   that occur while the configuration files are read, and errors that
   occur while targets are being built.

   One drawback, of course, is that these messages clutter the output.
   Fortunately, they're easily disabled by using the -Q option when
   invoking SCons:
C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

   Because we want this User's Guide to focus on what SCons is actually
   doing, we're going to use the -Q option to remove these messages from
   the output of all the remaining examples in this Guide.
   __________________________________________________________________

   ^[[254]1] In programming parlance, the SConstruct file is declarative,
   meaning you tell SCons what you want done and let it figure out the
   order in which to do it, rather than strictly imperative, where you
   specify explicitly the order in which to do things.

Chapter 3. Less Simple Things to Do With Builds

   In this chapter, you will see several examples of very simple build
   configurations using SCons, which will demonstrate how easy it is to
   use SCons to build programs from several different programming
   languages on different types of systems.

3.1. Specifying the Name of the Target (Output) File

   You've seen that when you call the [255]Program builder method, it
   builds the resulting program with the same base name as the source
   file. That is, the following call to build an executable program from
   the hello.c source file will build an executable program named hello on
   POSIX systems, and an executable program named hello.exe on Windows
   systems:
Program('hello.c')

   If you want to build a program with a different name than the base of
   the source file name, you simply put the target file name to the left
   of the source file name:
Program('new_hello', 'hello.c')

   (SCons requires the target file name first, followed by the source file
   name, so that the order mimics that of an assignment statement in most
   programming languages, including Python: "target = source files". For
   an alternative way to supply this information, see [256]Section 3.6,
   "Keyword Arguments").

   Now SCons will build an executable program named new_hello when run on
   a POSIX system:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o new_hello hello.o

   And SCons will build an executable program named new_hello.exe when run
   on a Windows system:
C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:new_hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

3.2. Compiling Multiple Source Files

   You've just seen how to configure SCons to compile a program from a
   single source file. It's more common, of course, that you'll need to
   build a program from many input source files, not just one. To do this,
   you need to put the source files in a Python list (enclosed in square
   brackets), like so:
Program(['prog.c', 'file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   A build of the above example would look like:
% scons -Q
cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o file1.o file2.o

   Notice that SCons deduces the output program name from the first source
   file specified in the list--that is, because the first source file was
   prog.c, SCons will name the resulting program prog (or prog.exe on a
   Windows system). If you want to specify a different program name, then
   (as we've seen in the previous section) you slide the list of source
   files over to the right to make room for the output program file name.
   (SCons puts the output file name to the left of the source file names
   so that the order mimics that of an assignment statement: program =
   source files.) This makes our example:
Program('program', ['prog.c', 'file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   On Linux, a build of this example would look like:
% scons -Q
cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o program prog.o file1.o file2.o

   Or on Windows:
C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fofile1.obj /c file1.c /nologo
cl /Fofile2.obj /c file2.c /nologo
cl /Foprog.obj /c prog.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:program.exe prog.obj file1.obj file2.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

3.3. Making a list of files with Glob

   You can also use the Glob function to find all files matching a certain
   template, using the standard shell pattern matching characters *, ? and
   [abc] to match any of a, b or c. [!abc] is also supported, to match any
   character except a, b or c. This makes many multi-source-file builds
   quite easy:
Program('program', Glob('*.c'))

   The SCons man page has more details on using Glob with variant
   directories (see [257]???, below) and repositories (see
   [258]Chapter 16, Building From Code Repositories, below), excluding
   some files and returning strings rather than Nodes.

3.4. Specifying Single Files Vs. Lists of Files

   We've now shown you two ways to specify the source for a program, one
   with a list of files:
Program('hello', ['file1.c', 'file2.c'])

   And one with a single file:
Program('hello', 'hello.c')

   You could actually put a single file name in a list, too, which you
   might prefer just for the sake of consistency:
Program('hello', ['hello.c'])

   SCons functions will accept a single file name in either form. In fact,
   internally, SCons treats all input as lists of files, but allows you to
   omit the square brackets to cut down a little on the typing when
   there's only a single file name.

Important

   Although SCons functions are forgiving about whether or not you use a
   string vs. a list for a single file name, Python itself is more strict
   about treating lists and strings differently. So where SCons allows
   either a string or list:
# The following two calls both work correctly:
Program('program1', 'program1.c')
Program('program2', ['program2.c'])

   Trying to do "Python things" that mix strings and lists will cause
   errors or lead to incorrect results:
common_sources = ['file1.c', 'file2.c']

# THE FOLLOWING IS INCORRECT AND GENERATES A PYTHON ERROR
# BECAUSE IT TRIES TO ADD A STRING TO A LIST:
Program('program1', common_sources + 'program1.c')

# The following works correctly, because it's adding two
# lists together to make another list.
Program('program2', common_sources + ['program2.c'])

3.5. Making Lists of Files Easier to Read

   One drawback to the use of a Python list for source files is that each
   file name must be enclosed in quotes (either single quotes or double
   quotes). This can get cumbersome and difficult to read when the list of
   file names is long. Fortunately, SCons and Python provide a number of
   ways to make sure that the SConstruct file stays easy to read.

   To make long lists of file names easier to deal with, SCons provides a
   Split function that takes a quoted list of file names, with the names
   separated by spaces or other white-space characters, and turns it into
   a list of separate file names. Using the Split function turns the
   previous example into:
Program('program', Split('main.c file1.c file2.c'))

   (If you're already familiar with Python, you'll have realized that this
   is similar to the split() method in the Python standard string module.
   Unlike the split() member function of strings, however, the Split
   function does not require a string as input and will wrap up a single
   non-string object in a list, or return its argument untouched if it's
   already a list. This comes in handy as a way to make sure arbitrary
   values can be passed to SCons functions without having to check the
   type of the variable by hand.)

   Putting the call to the Split function inside the Program call can also
   be a little unwieldy. A more readable alternative is to assign the
   output from the Split call to a variable name, and then use the
   variable when calling the Program function:
src_files = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
Program('program', src_files)

   Lastly, the Split function doesn't care how much white space separates
   the file names in the quoted string. This allows you to create lists of
   file names that span multiple lines, which often makes for easier
   editing:
src_files = Split("""main.c
                     file1.c
                     file2.c""")
Program('program', src_files)

   (Note in this example that we used the Python "triple-quote" syntax,
   which allows a string to contain multiple lines. The three quotes can
   be either single or double quotes.)

3.6. Keyword Arguments

   SCons also allows you to identify the output file and input source
   files using Python keyword arguments target and source. The Python
   syntax for this is:
src_files = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
Program(target='program', source=src_files)

   Because the keywords explicitly identify what each argument is, the
   order does not matter and you can reverse it if you prefer:
src_files = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
Program(source=src_files, target='program')

   Whether or not you choose to use keyword arguments to identify the
   target and source files, and the order in which you specify them when
   using keywords, are purely personal choices; SCons functions the same
   regardless.

3.7. Compiling Multiple Programs

   In order to compile multiple programs within the same SConstruct file,
   simply call the Program method multiple times, once for each program
   you need to build:
Program('foo.c')
Program('bar', ['bar1.c', 'bar2.c'])

   SCons would then build the programs as follows:
% scons -Q
cc -o bar1.o -c bar1.c
cc -o bar2.o -c bar2.c
cc -o bar bar1.o bar2.o
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

   Notice that SCons does not necessarily build the programs in the same
   order in which you specify them in the SConstruct file. SCons does,
   however, recognize that the individual object files must be built
   before the resulting program can be built. We'll discuss this in
   greater detail in the "Dependencies" section, below.

3.8. Sharing Source Files Between Multiple Programs

   It's common to re-use code by sharing source files between multiple
   programs. One way to do this is to create a library from the common
   source files, which can then be linked into resulting programs.
   (Creating libraries is discussed in [259]Chapter 4, Building and
   Linking with Libraries, below.)

   A more straightforward, but perhaps less convenient, way to share
   source files between multiple programs is simply to include the common
   files in the lists of source files for each program:
Program(Split('foo.c common1.c common2.c'))
Program('bar', Split('bar1.c bar2.c common1.c common2.c'))

   SCons recognizes that the object files for the common1.c and common2.c
   source files each need to be built only once, even though the resulting
   object files are each linked in to both of the resulting executable
   programs:
% scons -Q
cc -o bar1.o -c bar1.c
cc -o bar2.o -c bar2.c
cc -o common1.o -c common1.c
cc -o common2.o -c common2.c
cc -o bar bar1.o bar2.o common1.o common2.o
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o common1.o common2.o

   If two or more programs share a lot of common source files, repeating
   the common files in the list for each program can be a maintenance
   problem when you need to change the list of common files. You can
   simplify this by creating a separate Python list to hold the common
   file names, and concatenating it with other lists using the Python +
   operator:
common = ['common1.c', 'common2.c']
foo_files = ['foo.c'] + common
bar_files = ['bar1.c', 'bar2.c'] + common
Program('foo', foo_files)
Program('bar', bar_files)

   This is functionally equivalent to the previous example.

Chapter 4. Building and Linking with Libraries

   It's often useful to organize large software projects by collecting
   parts of the software into one or more libraries. SCons makes it easy
   to create libraries and to use them in the programs.

4.1. Building Libraries

   You build your own libraries by specifying [260]Library instead of
   [261]Program:
Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   SCons uses the appropriate library prefix and suffix for your system.
   So on POSIX or Linux systems, the above example would build as follows
   (although ranlib may not be called on all systems):
% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
ranlib libfoo.a

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:
C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo
cl /Fof2.obj /c f2.c /nologo
cl /Fof3.obj /c f3.c /nologo
lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj

   The rules for the target name of the library are similar to those for
   programs: if you don't explicitly specify a target library name, SCons
   will deduce one from the name of the first source file specified, and
   SCons will add an appropriate file prefix and suffix if you leave them
   off.

4.1.1. Building Libraries From Source Code or Object Files

   The previous example shows building a library from a list of source
   files. You can, however, also give the [262]Library call object files,
   and it will correctly realize they are object files. In fact, you can
   arbitrarily mix source code files and object files in the source list:
Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.o', 'f3.c', 'f4.o'])

   And SCons realizes that only the source code files must be compiled
   into object files before creating the final library:
% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o
ranlib libfoo.a

   Of course, in this example, the object files must already exist for the
   build to succeed. See [263]Chapter 5, Node Objects, below, for
   information about how you can build object files explicitly and include
   the built files in a library.

4.1.2. Building Static Libraries Explicitly: the StaticLibrary Builder

   The [264]Library function builds a traditional static library. If you
   want to be explicit about the type of library being built, you can use
   the synonym [265]StaticLibrary function instead of Library:
StaticLibrary('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   There is no functional difference between the [266]StaticLibrary and
   Library functions.

4.1.3. Building Shared (DLL) Libraries: the SharedLibrary Builder

   If you want to build a shared library (on POSIX systems) or a DLL file
   (on Windows systems), you use the [267]SharedLibrary function:
SharedLibrary('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   The output on POSIX:
% scons -Q
cc -o f1.os -c f1.c
cc -o f2.os -c f2.c
cc -o f3.os -c f3.c
cc -o libfoo.so -shared f1.os f2.os f3.os

   And the output on Windows:
C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo
cl /Fof2.obj /c f2.c /nologo
cl /Fof3.obj /c f3.c /nologo
link /nologo /dll /out:foo.dll /implib:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
RegServerFunc(target, source, env)
embedManifestDllCheck(target, source, env)

   Notice again that SCons takes care of building the output file
   correctly, adding the -shared option for a POSIX compilation, and the
   /dll option on Windows.

4.2. Linking with Libraries

   Usually, you build a library because you want to link it with one or
   more programs. You link libraries with a program by specifying the
   libraries in the [268]$LIBS construction variable, and by specifying
   the directory in which the library will be found in the [269]$LIBPATH
   construction variable:
Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo', 'bar'], LIBPATH='.')

   Notice, of course, that you don't need to specify a library prefix
   (like lib) or suffix (like .a or .lib). SCons uses the correct prefix
   or suffix for the current system.

   On a POSIX or Linux system, a build of the above example would look
   like:
% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
ranlib libfoo.a
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o -L. -lfoo -lbar

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:
C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo
cl /Fof2.obj /c f2.c /nologo
cl /Fof3.obj /c f3.c /nologo
lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
cl /Foprog.obj /c prog.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:. foo.lib bar.lib prog.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

   As usual, notice that SCons has taken care of constructing the correct
   command lines to link with the specified library on each system.

   Note also that, if you only have a single library to link with, you can
   specify the library name in single string, instead of a Python list, so
   that:
Program('prog.c', LIBS='foo', LIBPATH='.')

   is equivalent to:
Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo'], LIBPATH='.')

   This is similar to the way that SCons handles either a string or a list
   to specify a single source file.

4.3. Finding Libraries: the $LIBPATH Construction Variable

   By default, the linker will only look in certain system-defined
   directories for libraries. SCons knows how to look for libraries in
   directories that you specify with the [270]$LIBPATH construction
   variable. $LIBPATH consists of a list of directory names, like so:
Program('prog.c', LIBS = 'm',
                  LIBPATH = ['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])

   Using a Python list is preferred because it's portable across systems.
   Alternatively, you could put all of the directory names in a single
   string, separated by the system-specific path separator character: a
   colon on POSIX systems:
LIBPATH = '/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib'

   or a semi-colon on Windows systems:
LIBPATH = 'C:\\lib;D:\\lib'

   (Note that Python requires that the backslash separators in a Windows
   path name be escaped within strings.)

   When the linker is executed, SCons will create appropriate flags so
   that the linker will look for libraries in the same directories as
   SCons. So on a POSIX or Linux system, a build of the above example
   would look like:
% scons -Q
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o -L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lm

   On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:
C:\>scons -Q
cl /Foprog.obj /c prog.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:\usr\lib /LIBPATH:\usr\local\lib m.lib prog.
obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

   Note again that SCons has taken care of the system-specific details of
   creating the right command-line options.

Chapter 5. Node Objects

   Internally, SCons represents all of the files and directories it knows
   about as Nodes. These internal objects (not object files) can be used
   in a variety of ways to make your SConscript files portable and easy to
   read.

5.1. Builder Methods Return Lists of Target Nodes

   All builder methods return a list of Node objects that identify the
   target file or files that will be built. These returned Nodes can be
   passed as arguments to other builder methods.

   For example, suppose that we want to build the two object files that
   make up a program with different options. This would mean calling the
   [271]Object builder once for each object file, specifying the desired
   options:
Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')

   One way to combine these object files into the resulting program would
   be to call the [272]Program builder with the names of the object files
   listed as sources:
Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')
Program(['hello.o', 'goodbye.o'])

   The problem with specifying the names as strings is that our SConstruct
   file is no longer portable across operating systems. It won't, for
   example, work on Windows because the object files there would be named
   hello.obj and goodbye.obj, not hello.o and goodbye.o.

   A better solution is to assign the lists of targets returned by the
   calls to the Object builder to variables, which we can then concatenate
   in our call to the Program builder:
hello_list = Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
goodbye_list = Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')
Program(hello_list + goodbye_list)

   This makes our SConstruct file portable again, the build output on
   Linux looking like:
% scons -Q
cc -o goodbye.o -c -DGOODBYE goodbye.c
cc -o hello.o -c -DHELLO hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o goodbye.o

   And on Windows:
C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fogoodbye.obj /c goodbye.c -DGOODBYE
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c -DHELLO
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj goodbye.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

   We'll see examples of using the list of nodes returned by builder
   methods throughout the rest of this guide.

5.2. Explicitly Creating File and Directory Nodes

   It's worth mentioning here that SCons maintains a clear distinction
   between Nodes that represent files and Nodes that represent
   directories. SCons supports File and Dir functions that, respectively,
   return a file or directory Node:
hello_c = File('hello.c')
Program(hello_c)

classes = Dir('classes')
Java(classes, 'src')

   Normally, you don't need to call File or Dir directly, because calling
   a builder method automatically treats strings as the names of files or
   directories, and translates them into the Node objects for you. The
   File and Dir functions can come in handy in situations where you need
   to explicitly instruct SCons about the type of Node being passed to a
   builder or other function, or unambiguously refer to a specific file in
   a directory tree.

   There are also times when you may need to refer to an entry in a file
   system without knowing in advance whether it's a file or a directory.
   For those situations, SCons also supports an Entry function, which
   returns a Node that can represent either a file or a directory.
xyzzy = Entry('xyzzy')

   The returned xyzzy Node will be turned into a file or directory Node
   the first time it is used by a builder method or other function that
   requires one vs. the other.

5.3. Printing Node File Names

   One of the most common things you can do with a Node is use it to print
   the file name that the node represents. Keep in mind, though, that
   because the object returned by a builder call is a list of Nodes, you
   must use Python subscripts to fetch individual Nodes from the list. For
   example, the following SConstruct file:
object_list = Object('hello.c')
program_list = Program(object_list)
print("The object file is: %s"%object_list[0])
print("The program file is: %s"%program_list[0])

   Would print the following file names on a POSIX system:
% scons -Q
The object file is: hello.o
The program file is: hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   And the following file names on a Windows system:
C:\>scons -Q
The object file is: hello.obj
The program file is: hello.exe
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

   Note that in the above example, the object_list[0] extracts an actual
   Node object from the list, and the Python print function converts the
   object to a string for printing.

5.4. Using a Node's File Name as a String

   Printing a Node's name as described in the previous section works
   because the string representation of a Node object is the name of the
   file. If you want to do something other than print the name of the
   file, you can fetch it by using the builtin Python str function. For
   example, if you want to use the Python os.path.exists to figure out
   whether a file exists while the SConstruct file is being read and
   executed, you can fetch the string as follows:
import os.path
program_list = Program('hello.c')
program_name = str(program_list[0])
if not os.path.exists(program_name):
    print("%s does not exist!"%program_name)

   Which executes as follows on a POSIX system:
% scons -Q
hello does not exist!
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

5.5. GetBuildPath: Getting the Path From a Node or String

   env.GetBuildPath(file_or_list) returns the path of a Node or a string
   representing a path. It can also take a list of Nodes and/or strings,
   and returns the list of paths. If passed a single Node, the result is
   the same as calling str(node) (see above). The string(s) can have
   embedded construction variables, which are expanded as usual, using the
   calling environment's set of variables. The paths can be files or
   directories, and do not have to exist.
env=Environment(VAR="value")
n=File("foo.c")
print(env.GetBuildPath([n, "sub/dir/$VAR"]))

   Would print the following file names:
% scons -Q
['foo.c', 'sub/dir/value']
scons: `.' is up to date.

   There is also a function version of GetBuildPath which can be called
   without an Environment; that uses the default SCons Environment to do
   substitution on any string arguments.

Chapter 6. Dependencies

   So far we've seen how SCons handles one-time builds. But one of the
   main functions of a build tool like SCons is to rebuild only what is
   necessary when source files change--or, put another way, SCons should
   not waste time rebuilding things that don't need to be rebuilt. You can
   see this at work simply by re-invoking SCons after building our simple
   hello example:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.

   The second time it is executed, SCons realizes that the hello program
   is up-to-date with respect to the current hello.c source file, and
   avoids rebuilding it. You can see this more clearly by naming the hello
   program explicitly on the command line:
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Note that SCons reports "...is up to date" only for target files named
   explicitly on the command line, to avoid cluttering the output.

6.1. Deciding When an Input File Has Changed: the Decider Function

   Another aspect of avoiding unnecessary rebuilds is the fundamental
   build tool behavior of rebuilding things when an input file changes, so
   that the built software is up to date. By default, SCons keeps track of
   this through a content signature, or hash, of the contents of each
   file, although you can easily configure SCons to use the modification
   times (or time stamps) instead. You can even write your own Python
   function for deciding if an input file should trigger a rebuild.

6.1.1. Using Content Signatures to Decide if a File Has Changed

   By default, SCons uses a cryptographic hash of the file's contents, not
   the file's modification time, to decide whether a file has changed.
   This means that you may be surprised by the default SCons behavior if
   you are used to the Make convention of forcing a rebuild by updating
   the file's modification time (using the touch command, for example):
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% touch hello.c
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Even though the file's modification time has changed, SCons realizes
   that the contents of the hello.c file have not changed, and therefore
   that the hello program need not be rebuilt. This avoids unnecessary
   rebuilds when, for example, someone rewrites the contents of a file
   without making a change. But if the contents of the file really do
   change, then SCons detects the change and rebuilds the program as
   required:
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
%     [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   Note that you can, if you wish, specify the default behavior of using
   content signatures explicitly, using the [273]Decider function as
   follows:
Program('hello.c')
Decider('content')

   You can also use the string 'MD5' as a synonym for 'content' when
   calling the Decider function - this older name is deprecated since
   SCons now supports a choice of hash functions, not just the MD5
   function.

6.1.1.1. Ramifications of Using Content Signatures

   Using content signatures to decide if an input file has changed has one
   surprising benefit: if a source file has been changed in such a way
   that the contents of the rebuilt target file(s) will be exactly the
   same as the last time the file was built, then any "downstream" target
   files that depend on the rebuilt-but-not-changed target file actually
   need not be rebuilt.

   So if, for example, a user were to only change a comment in a hello.c
   file, then the rebuilt hello.o file would be exactly the same as the
   one previously built (assuming the compiler doesn't put any
   build-specific information in the object file). SCons would then
   realize that it would not need to rebuild the hello program as follows:
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
%   [CHANGE A COMMENT IN hello.c]
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In essence, SCons "short-circuits" any dependent builds when it
   realizes that a target file has been rebuilt to exactly the same file
   as the last build. This does take some extra processing time to read
   the contents of the target (hello.o) file, but often saves time when
   the rebuild that was avoided would have been time-consuming and
   expensive.

6.1.2. Using Time Stamps to Decide If a File Has Changed

   If you prefer, you can configure SCons to use the modification time of
   a file, not the file contents, when deciding if a target needs to be
   rebuilt. SCons gives you two ways to use time stamps to decide if an
   input file has changed since the last time a target has been built.

   The most familiar way to use time stamps is the way Make does: that is,
   have SCons decide that a target must be rebuilt if a source file's
   modification time is newer than the target file. To do this, call the
   [274]Decider function as follows:
Object('hello.c')
Decider('timestamp-newer')

   This makes SCons act like Make when a file's modification time is
   updated (using the touch command, for example):
% scons -Q hello.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
% touch hello.c
% scons -Q hello.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c

   And, in fact, because this behavior is the same as the behavior of
   Make, you can also use the string 'make' as a synonym for
   'timestamp-newer' when calling the Decider function:
Object('hello.c')
Decider('make')

   One drawback to using times stamps exactly like Make is that if an
   input file's modification time suddenly becomes older than a target
   file, the target file will not be rebuilt. This can happen if an old
   copy of a source file is restored from a backup archive, for example.
   The contents of the restored file will likely be different than they
   were the last time a dependent target was built, but the target won't
   be rebuilt because the modification time of the source file is not
   newer than the target.

   Because SCons actually stores information about the source files' time
   stamps whenever a target is built, it can handle this situation by
   checking for an exact match of the source file time stamp, instead of
   just whether or not the source file is newer than the target file. To
   do this, specify the argument 'timestamp-match' when calling the
   Decider function:
Object('hello.c')
Decider('timestamp-match')

   When configured this way, SCons will rebuild a target whenever a source
   file's modification time has changed. So if we use the touch -t option
   to change the modification time of hello.c to an old date (January 1,
   1989), SCons will still rebuild the target file:
% scons -Q hello.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
% touch -t 198901010000 hello.c
% scons -Q hello.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c

   In general, the only reason to prefer timestamp-newer instead of
   timestamp-match, would be if you have some specific reason to require
   this Make-like behavior of not rebuilding a target when an
   otherwise-modified source file is older.

6.1.3. Deciding If a File Has Changed Using Both MD Signatures and Time
Stamps

   As a performance enhancement, SCons provides a way to use a file's
   content signature, but to read those contents only when the file's
   timestamp has changed. To do this, call the [275]Decider function with
   'content-timestamp' argument as follows:
Program('hello.c')
Decider('content-timestamp')

   So configured, SCons will still behave like it does when using
   Decider('content'):
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% touch hello.c
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.
% edit hello.c
    [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   However, the second call to SCons in the above output, when the build
   is up-to-date, will have been performed by simply looking at the
   modification time of the hello.c file, not by opening it and performing
   a signature calcuation on its contents. This can significantly speed up
   many up-to-date builds.

   The only drawback to using Decider('content-timestamp') is that SCons
   will not rebuild a target file if a source file was modified within one
   second of the last time SCons built the file. While most developers are
   programming, this isn't a problem in practice, since it's unlikely that
   someone will have built and then thought quickly enough to make a
   substantive change to a source file within one second. Certain build
   scripts or continuous integration tools may, however, rely on the
   ability to apply changes to files automatically and then rebuild as
   quickly as possible, in which case use of Decider('content-timestamp')
   may not be appropriate.

6.1.4. Extending SCons: Writing Your Own Custom Decider Function

   The different string values that we've passed to the [276]Decider
   function are essentially used by SCons to pick one of several specific
   internal functions that implement various ways of deciding if a
   dependency (usually a source file) has changed since a target file has
   been built. As it turns out, you can also supply your own function to
   decide if a dependency has changed.

   For example, suppose we have an input file that contains a lot of data,
   in some specific regular format, that is used to rebuild a lot of
   different target files, but each target file really only depends on one
   particular section of the input file. We'd like to have each target
   file depend on only its section of the input file. However, since the
   input file may contain a lot of data, we want to open the input file
   only if its timestamp has changed. This could be done with a custom
   Decider function that might look something like this:
Program('hello.c')
def decide_if_changed(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
    if dependency.get_timestamp() != prev_ni.timestamp:
        dep = str(dependency)
        tgt = str(target)
        if specific_part_of_file_has_changed(dep, tgt):
            return True
    return False
Decider(decide_if_changed)

   Note that in the function definition, the dependency (input file) is
   the first argument, and then the target. Both of these are passed to
   the functions as SCons Node objects, which we convert to strings using
   the Python str().

   The third argument, prev_ni, is an object that holds the content
   signature and/or timestamp information that was recorded about the
   dependency the last time the target was built. A prev_ni object can
   hold different information, depending on the type of thing that the
   dependency argument represents. For normal files, the prev_ni object
   has the following attributes:

   csig
          The content signature: a cryptgraphic hash, or checksum, of the
          file contents of the dependency file the last time the target
          was built.

   size
          The size in bytes of the dependency file the last time the
          target was built.

   timestamp
          The modification time of the dependency file the last time the
          target was built.

   These attributes may not be present at the time of the first run.
   Without any prior build, no targets have been created and no .sconsign
   DB file exists yet. So you should always check whether the prev_ni
   attribute in question is available (use the Python hasattr method or a
   try-except block).

   The fourth argument repo_node is the Node to use if it is not None when
   comparing BuildInfo. This is typically only set when the target node
   only exists in a Repository

   Note that ignoring some of the arguments in your custom Decider
   function is a perfectly normal thing to do, if they don't impact the
   way you want to decide if the dependency file has changed.

   We finally present a small example for a csig-based decider function.
   Note how the signature information for the dependency file has to get
   initialized via get_csig during each function call (this is
   mandatory!).
env = Environment()


def config_file_decider(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
    import os.path

    # We always have to init the .csig value...
    dep_csig = dependency.get_csig()
    # .csig may not exist, because no target was built yet...
    if not prev_ni.hasattr("csig"):
        return True
    # Target file may not exist yet
    if not os.path.exists(str(target.abspath)):
        return True
    if dep_csig != prev_ni.csig:
        # Some change on source file => update installed one
        return True
    return False


def update_file():
    with open("test.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write("some line\n")


update_file()

# Activate our own decider function
env.Decider(config_file_decider)

env.Install("install", "test.txt")

6.1.5. Mixing Different Ways of Deciding If a File Has Changed

   The previous examples have all demonstrated calling the global
   [277]Decider function to configure all dependency decisions that SCons
   makes. Sometimes, however, you want to be able to configure different
   decision-making for different targets. When that's necessary, you can
   use the env.Decider method to affect only the configuration decisions
   for targets built with a specific construction environment.

   For example, if we arbitrarily want to build one program using content
   signatures and another using file modification times from the same
   source we might configure it this way:
env1 = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
env2 = env1.Clone()
env2.Decider('timestamp-match')
env1.Program('prog-content', 'program1.c')
env2.Program('prog-timestamp', 'program2.c')

   If both of the programs include the same inc.h file, then updating the
   modification time of inc.h (using the touch command) will cause only
   prog-timestamp to be rebuilt:
% scons -Q
cc -o program1.o -c -I. program1.c
cc -o prog-content program1.o
cc -o program2.o -c -I. program2.c
cc -o prog-timestamp program2.o
% touch inc.h
% scons -Q
cc -o program2.o -c -I. program2.c
cc -o prog-timestamp program2.o

6.2. Implicit Dependencies: The $CPPPATH Construction Variable

   Now suppose that our "Hello, World!" program actually has an #include
   line to include the hello.h file in the compilation:
#include <hello.h>
int
main()
{
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", string);
}

   And, for completeness, the hello.h file looks like this:
#define string    "world"


   In this case, we want SCons to recognize that, if the contents of the
   hello.h file change, the hello program must be recompiled. To do this,
   we need to modify the SConstruct file like so:
Program('hello.c', CPPPATH='.')


   The [278]$CPPPATH value tells SCons to look in the current directory
   ('.') for any files included by C source files (.c or .h files). With
   this assignment in the SConstruct file:
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.
%     [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   First, notice that SCons constructed the -I. argument from the '.' in
   the $CPPPATH variable so that the compilation would find the hello.h
   file in the local directory.

   Second, realize that SCons knows that the hello program must be rebuilt
   because it scans the contents of the hello.c file for the #include
   lines that indicate another file is being included in the compilation.
   SCons records these as implicit dependencies of the target file,
   Consequently, when the hello.h file changes, SCons realizes that the
   hello.c file includes it, and rebuilds the resulting hello program that
   depends on both the hello.c and hello.h files.

   Like the [279]$LIBPATH variable, the $CPPPATH variable may be a list of
   directories, or a string separated by the system-specific path
   separation character (':' on POSIX/Linux, ';' on Windows). Either way,
   SCons creates the right command-line options so that the following
   example:
Program('hello.c', CPPPATH = ['include', '/home/project/inc'])

   Will look like this on POSIX or Linux:
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c -Iinclude -I/home/project/inc hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   And like this on Windows:
C:\>scons -Q hello.exe
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo /Iinclude /I\home\project\inc
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

6.3. Caching Implicit Dependencies

   Scanning each file for #include lines does take some extra processing
   time. When you're doing a full build of a large system, the scanning
   time is usually a very small percentage of the overall time spent on
   the build. You're most likely to notice the scanning time, however,
   when you rebuild all or part of a large system: SCons will likely take
   some extra time to "think about" what must be built before it issues
   the first build command (or decides that everything is up to date and
   nothing must be rebuilt).

   In practice, having SCons scan files saves time relative to the amount
   of potential time lost to tracking down subtle problems introduced by
   incorrect dependencies. Nevertheless, the "waiting time" while SCons
   scans files can annoy individual developers waiting for their builds to
   finish. Consequently, SCons lets you cache the implicit dependencies
   that its scanners find, for use by later builds. You can do this by
   specifying the --implicit-cache option on the command line:
% scons -Q --implicit-cache hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

   If you don't want to specify --implicit-cache on the command line each
   time, you can make it the default behavior for your build by setting
   the implicit_cache option in an SConscript file:
SetOption('implicit_cache', 1)

   SCons does not cache implicit dependencies like this by default because
   the --implicit-cache causes SCons to simply use the implicit
   dependencies stored during the last run, without any checking for
   whether or not those dependencies are still correct. Specifically, this
   means --implicit-cache instructs SCons to not rebuild "correctly" in
   the following cases:
     * When --implicit-cache is used, SCons will ignore any changes that
       may have been made to search paths (like $CPPPATH or $LIBPATH,).
       This can lead to SCons not rebuilding a file if a change to
       $CPPPATH would normally cause a different, same-named file from a
       different directory to be used.
     * When --implicit-cache is used, SCons will not detect if a
       same-named file has been added to a directory that is earlier in
       the search path than the directory in which the file was found last
       time.

6.3.1. The --implicit-deps-changed Option

   When using cached implicit dependencies, sometimes you want to "start
   fresh" and have SCons re-scan the files for which it previously cached
   the dependencies. For example, if you have recently installed a new
   version of external code that you use for compilation, the external
   header files will have changed and the previously-cached implicit
   dependencies will be out of date. You can update them by running SCons
   with the --implicit-deps-changed option:
% scons -Q --implicit-deps-changed hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In this case, SCons will re-scan all of the implicit dependencies and
   cache updated copies of the information.

6.3.2. The --implicit-deps-unchanged Option

   By default when caching dependencies, SCons notices when a file has
   been modified and re-scans the file for any updated implicit dependency
   information. Sometimes, however, you may want to force SCons to use the
   cached implicit dependencies, even if the source files changed. This
   can speed up a build for example, when you have changed your source
   files but know that you haven't changed any #include lines. In this
   case, you can use the --implicit-deps-unchanged option:
% scons -Q --implicit-deps-unchanged hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

   In this case, SCons will assume that the cached implicit dependencies
   are correct and will not bother to re-scan changed files. For typical
   builds after small, incremental changes to source files, the savings
   may not be very big, but sometimes every bit of improved performance
   counts.

6.4. Explicit Dependencies: the Depends Function

   Sometimes a file depends on another file that is not detected by an
   SCons scanner. For this situation, SCons allows you to specific
   explicitly that one file depends on another file, and must be rebuilt
   whenever that file changes. This is specified using the [280]Depends
   method:
hello = Program('hello.c')
Depends(hello, 'other_file')

% scons -Q hello
cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.
% edit other_file
    [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF other_file]
% scons -Q hello
cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
cc -o hello hello.o

   Note that the dependency (the second argument to Depends) may also be a
   list of Node objects (for example, as returned by a call to a Builder):
hello = Program('hello.c')
goodbye = Program('goodbye.c')
Depends(hello, goodbye)

   in which case the dependency or dependencies will be built before the
   target(s):
% scons -Q hello
cc -c goodbye.c -o goodbye.o
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
cc -o hello hello.o

6.5. Dependencies From External Files: the ParseDepends Function

   SCons has built-in scanners for a number of languages. Sometimes these
   scanners fail to extract certain implicit dependencies due to
   limitations of the scanner implementation.

   The following example illustrates a case where the built-in C scanner
   is unable to extract the implicit dependency on a header file.
#define FOO_HEADER <foo.h>
#include FOO_HEADER

int main() {
    return FOO;
}

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
%    [CHANGE CONTENTS OF foo.h]
% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.

   Apparently, the scanner does not know about the header dependency. Not
   being a full-fledged C preprocessor, the scanner does not expand the
   macro.

   In these cases, you may also use the compiler to extract the implicit
   dependencies. [281]ParseDepends can parse the contents of the compiler
   output in the style of Make, and explicitly establish all of the listed
   dependencies.

   The following example uses ParseDepends to process a compiler generated
   dependency file which is generated as a side effect during compilation
   of the object file:
obj = Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-MD -MF hello.d', CPPPATH='.')
SideEffect('hello.d', obj)
ParseDepends('hello.d')
Program('hello', obj)

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
%    [CHANGE CONTENTS OF foo.h]
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c

   Parsing dependencies from a compiler-generated .d file has a
   chicken-and-egg problem, that causes unnecessary rebuilds:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q --debug=explain
scons: rebuilding `hello.o' because `foo.h' is a new dependency
cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c
% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.

   In the first pass, the dependency file is generated while the object
   file is compiled. At that time, SCons does not know about the
   dependency on foo.h. In the second pass, the object file is regenerated
   because foo.h is detected as a new dependency.

   ParseDepends immediately reads the specified file at invocation time
   and just returns if the file does not exist. A dependency file
   generated during the build process is not automatically parsed again.
   Hence, the compiler-extracted dependencies are not stored in the
   signature database during the same build pass. This limitation of
   ParseDepends leads to unnecessary recompilations. Therefore,
   ParseDepends should only be used if scanners are not available for the
   employed language or not powerful enough for the specific task.

6.6. Ignoring Dependencies: the Ignore Function

   Sometimes it makes sense to not rebuild a program, even if a dependency
   file changes. In this case, you would tell SCons specifically to ignore
   a dependency using the [282]Ignore function as follows:
hello_obj=Object('hello.c')
hello = Program(hello_obj)
Ignore(hello_obj, 'hello.h')

% scons -Q hello
cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.
% edit hello.h
  [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

   Now, the above example is a little contrived, because it's hard to
   imagine a real-world situation where you wouldn't want to rebuild hello
   if the hello.h file changed. A more realistic example might be if the
   hello program is being built in a directory that is shared between
   multiple systems that have different copies of the stdio.h include
   file. In that case, SCons would notice the differences between the
   different systems' copies of stdio.h and would rebuild hello each time
   you change systems. You could avoid these rebuilds as follows:
hello = Program('hello.c', CPPPATH=['/usr/include'])
Ignore(hello, '/usr/include/stdio.h')

   Ignore can also be used to prevent a generated file from being built by
   default. This is due to the fact that directories depend on their
   contents. So to ignore a generated file from the default build, you
   specify that the directory should ignore the generated file. Note that
   the file will still be built if the user specifically requests the
   target on scons command line, or if the file is a dependency of another
   file which is requested and/or is built by default.
hello_obj=Object('hello.c')
hello = Program(hello_obj)
Ignore('.',[hello,hello_obj])

% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

6.7. Order-Only Dependencies: the Requires Function

   Occasionally, it may be useful to specify that a certain file or
   directory must, if necessary, be built or created before some other
   target is built, but that changes to that file or directory do not
   require that the target itself be rebuilt. Such a relationship is
   called an order-only dependency because it only affects the order in
   which things must be built--the dependency before the target--but it is
   not a strict dependency relationship because the target should not
   change in response to changes in the dependent file.

   For example, suppose that you want to create a file every time you run
   a build that identifies the time the build was performed, the version
   number, etc., and which is included in every program that you build.
   The version file's contents will change every build. If you specify a
   normal dependency relationship, then every program that depends on that
   file would be rebuilt every time you ran SCons. For example, we could
   use some Python code in a SConstruct file to create a new version.c
   file with a string containing the current date every time we run SCons,
   and then link a program with the resulting object file by listing
   version.c in the sources:
import time

version_c_text = """
char *date = "%s";
""" % time.ctime(time.time())
open('version.c', 'w').write(version_c_text)

hello = Program(['hello.c', 'version.c'])

   If we list version.c as an actual source file, though, then the
   version.o file will get rebuilt every time we run SCons (because the
   SConstruct file itself changes the contents of version.c) and the hello
   executable will get re-linked every time (because the version.o file
   changes):
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o version.o -c version.c
cc -o hello hello.o version.o
% sleep 1
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
cc -o hello hello.o version.o
% sleep 1
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
cc -o hello hello.o version.o

   (Note that for the above example to work, we sleep for one second in
   between each run, so that the SConstruct file will create a version.c
   file with a time string that's one second later than the previous run.)

   One solution is to use the [283]Requires function to specify that the
   version.o must be rebuilt before it is used by the link step, but that
   changes to version.o should not actually cause the hello executable to
   be re-linked:
import time

version_c_text = """
char *date = "%s";
""" % time.ctime(time.time())
open('version.c', 'w').write(version_c_text)

version_obj = Object('version.c')

hello = Program('hello.c',
                LINKFLAGS = str(version_obj[0]))

Requires(hello, version_obj)

   Notice that because we can no longer list version.c as one of the
   sources for the hello program, we have to find some other way to get it
   into the link command line. For this example, we're cheating a bit and
   stuffing the object file name (extracted from version_obj list returned
   by the Object builder call) into the [284]$LINKFLAGS variable, because
   $LINKFLAGS is already included in the [285]$LINKCOM command line.

   With these changes, we get the desired behavior of only re-linking the
   hello executable when the hello.c has changed, even though the
   version.o is rebuilt (because the SConstruct file still changes the
   version.c contents directly each run):
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello version.o hello.o
% sleep 1
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
scons: `hello' is up to date.
% sleep 1
%     [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello version.o hello.o
% sleep 1
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
scons: `hello' is up to date.

6.8. The AlwaysBuild Function

   How SCons handles dependencies can also be affected by the
   [286]AlwaysBuild method. When a file is passed to the AlwaysBuild
   method, like so:
hello = Program('hello.c')
AlwaysBuild(hello)

   Then the specified target file (hello in our example) will always be
   considered out-of-date and rebuilt whenever that target file is
   evaluated while walking the dependency graph:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q
cc -o hello hello.o

   The AlwaysBuild function has a somewhat misleading name, because it
   does not actually mean the target file will be rebuilt every single
   time SCons is invoked. Instead, it means that the target will, in fact,
   be rebuilt whenever the target file is encountered while evaluating the
   targets specified on the command line (and their dependencies). So
   specifying some other target on the command line, a target that does
   not itself depend on the AlwaysBuild target, will still be rebuilt only
   if it's out-of-date with respect to its dependencies:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello.o
scons: `hello.o' is up to date.

Chapter 7. Environments

   An environment is a collection of values that can affect how a program
   executes. SCons distinguishes between three different types of
   environments that can affect the behavior of SCons itself (subject to
   the configuration in the SConscript files), as well as the compilers
   and other tools it executes:

   External Environment
          The External Environment is the set of variables in the user's
          environment at the time the user runs SCons. These variables are
          not automatically part of an SCons build but are available to be
          examined if needed. See [287]Section 7.1, "Using Values From the
          External Environment", below.

   Construction Environment
          A Construction Environment is a distinct object created within a
          SConscript file and which contains values that affect how SCons
          decides what action to use to build a target, and even to define
          which targets should be built from which sources. One of the
          most powerful features of SCons is the ability to create
          multiple construction environments, including the ability to
          clone a new, customized construction environment from an
          existing construction environment. See [288]Section 7.2,
          "Construction Environments", below.

   Execution Environment
          An Execution Environment is the values that SCons sets when
          executing an external command (such as a compiler or linker) to
          build one or more targets. Note that this is not the same as the
          external environment (see above). See [289]Section 7.3,
          "Controlling the Execution Environment for Issued Commands",
          below.

   Unlike Make, SCons does not automatically copy or import values between
   different environments (with the exception of explicit clones of
   construction environments, which inherit the values from their parent).
   This is a deliberate design choice to make sure that builds are, by
   default, repeatable regardless of the values in the user's external
   environment. This avoids a whole class of problems with builds where a
   developer's local build works because a custom variable setting causes
   a different compiler or build option to be used, but the checked-in
   change breaks the official build because it uses different environment
   variable settings.

   Note that the SConscript writer can easily arrange for variables to be
   copied or imported between environments, and this is often very useful
   (or even downright necessary) to make it easy for developers to
   customize the build in appropriate ways. The point is not that copying
   variables between different environments is evil and must always be
   avoided. Instead, it should be up to the implementer of the build
   system to make conscious choices about how and when to import a
   variable from one environment to another, making informed decisions
   about striking the right balance between making the build repeatable on
   the one hand and convenient to use on the other.

   Sidebar: Python Dictionaries

   If you're not familiar with the Python programming language, we need to
   talk a little bit about the Python dictionary data type. A dictionary
   (also known by terms such as mapping, associative array and key-value
   store) associates keys with values, such that asking the dict about a
   key gives you back the associated value and assigning to a key creates
   the association - either a new setting if the key was unknown, or
   replacing the previous association if the key was already in the
   dictionary. Values can be retrieved using item access (the key name in
   square brackets ([])), and dictionaries also provide a method named get
   which responds with a default value, either None or a value you supply
   as the second argument, if the key is not in the dictionary, which
   avoids failing in that case. The syntax for initializing a dictionary
   uses curly braces ({}). Here are some simple examples (inspired by
   those in the official Python tutorial) using syntax that indicates
   interacting with the Python interpreter (>>> is the interpreter prompt)
   - you can try these out:
>>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}
>>> tel['guido'] = 4127
>>> tel['jack']
4098
>>> del tel['sape']
>>> tel['irv'] = 4127
>>> print(tel)
{'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127}
>>> 'guido' in tel
True
>>> print(tel['jack'])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'jack'
>>> print(tel.get('jack'))
None

   Construction environments are written to behave like a Python
   dictionary, and the $ENV construction variable in a construction
   environment is a Python dictionary. The os.environ value that Python
   uses to make available the external environment is also a dictionary.
   We will need these concepts in this chapter and throughout the rest of
   this guide.

7.1. Using Values From the External Environment

   The external environment variable settings that the user has in force
   when executing SCons are available in the Python os.environ dictionary.
   That syntax means the environ attribute of the os module. In Python, to
   access the contents of a module you must first import it - so you would
   include the import os statement to any SConscript file in which you
   want to use values from the user's external environment.
import os

print("Shell is", os.environ['SHELL'])

   More usefully, you can use the os.environ dictionary in your SConscript
   files to initialize construction environments with values from the
   user's external environment. Read on to the next section for
   information on how to do this.

7.2. Construction Environments

   It is rare that all of the software in a large, complicated system
   needs to be built exactly the same way. For example, different source
   files may need different options enabled on the command line, or
   different executable programs need to be linked with different
   libraries. SCons accommodates these different build requirements by
   allowing you to create and configure multiple construction environments
   that control how the software is built. A construction environment is
   an object that has a number of associated construction variables, each
   with a name and a value, just like a dictionary. (A construction
   environment also has an attached set of Builder methods, about which
   we'll learn more later.)

7.2.1. Creating a Construction Environment: the Environment Function

   A construction environment is created by the Environment method:
env = Environment()

   By default, SCons initializes every new construction environment with a
   set of construction variables based on the tools that it finds on your
   system, plus the default set of builder methods necessary for using
   those tools. The construction variables are initialized with values
   describing the C compiler, the Fortran compiler, the linker, etc., as
   well as the command lines to invoke them.

   When you initialize a construction environment you can set the values
   of the environment's construction variables to control how a program is
   built. For example:
env = Environment(CC='gcc', CCFLAGS='-O2')
env.Program('foo.c')

   The construction environment in this example is still initialized with
   the same default construction variable values, except that the user has
   explicitly specified use of the GNU C compiler gcc, and that the -O2
   (optimization level two) flag should be used when compiling the object
   file. In other words, the explicit initializations of [290]$CC and
   [291]$CCFLAGS override the default values in the newly-created
   construction environment. So a run from this example would look like:
% scons -Q
gcc -o foo.o -c -O2 foo.c
gcc -o foo foo.o

7.2.2. Fetching Values From a Construction Environment

   You can fetch individual values, known as Construction Variables, using
   the same syntax used for accessing individual named items in a Python
   dictionary:
env = Environment()
print("CC is: %s" % env['CC'])
print("LATEX is: %s" % env.get('LATEX', None))

   This example SConstruct file doesn't contain instructions for building
   any targets, but because it's still a valid SConstruct it will be
   evaluated and the Python print calls will output the values of [292]$CC
   and [293]$LATEX for us (remember using the .get() method for fetching
   means we get a default value back, rather than a failure, if the
   variable is not set):
% scons -Q
CC is: cc
LATEX is: None
scons: `.' is up to date.

   A construction environment is actually an object with associated
   methods and attributes. If you want to have direct access to only the
   dictionary of construction variables you can fetch this using the
   [294]env.Dictionary method (although it's rarely necessary to use this
   method):
env = Environment(FOO='foo', BAR='bar')
cvars = env.Dictionary()
for key in ['OBJSUFFIX', 'LIBSUFFIX', 'PROGSUFFIX']:
    print("key = %s, value = %s" % (key, cvars[key]))

   This SConstruct file will print the specified dictionary items for us
   on POSIX systems as follows:
% scons -Q
key = OBJSUFFIX, value = .o
key = LIBSUFFIX, value = .a
key = PROGSUFFIX, value =
scons: `.' is up to date.

   And on Windows:
C:\>scons -Q
key = OBJSUFFIX, value = .obj
key = LIBSUFFIX, value = .lib
key = PROGSUFFIX, value = .exe
scons: `.' is up to date.

   If you want to loop and print the values of all of the construction
   variables in a construction environment, the Python code to do that in
   sorted order might look something like:
env = Environment()
for item in sorted(env.Dictionary().items()):
    print("construction variable = '%s', value = '%s'" % item)

   It should be noted that for the previous example, there is actually a
   construction environment method that does the same thing more simply,
   and tries to format the output nicely as well:
env = Environment()
print(env.Dump())

7.2.3. Expanding Values From a Construction Environment: the subst Method

   Another way to get information from a construction environment is to
   use the subst method on a string containing $ expansions of
   construction variable names. As a simple example, the example from the
   previous section that used env['CC'] to fetch the value of [295]$CC
   could also be written as:
env = Environment()
print("CC is: %s" % env.subst('$CC'))

   One advantage of using subst to expand strings is that construction
   variables in the result get re-expanded until there are no expansions
   left in the string. So a simple fetch of a value like [296]$CCCOM:
env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-DFOO')
print("CCCOM is: %s" % env['CCCOM'])

   Will print the unexpanded value of $CCCOM, showing us the construction
   variables that still need to be expanded:
% scons -Q
CCCOM is: $CC $CCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPDEFFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOUR
CES
scons: `.' is up to date.

   Calling the subst method on $CCOM, however:
env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-DFOO')
print("CCCOM is: %s" % env.subst('$CCCOM'))

   Will recursively expand all of the construction variables prefixed with
   $ (dollar signs), showing us the final output:
% scons -Q
CCCOM is: gcc -DFOO -c -o
scons: `.' is up to date.

   Note that because we're not expanding this in the context of building
   something there are no target or source files for [297]$TARGET and
   [298]$SOURCES to expand.

7.2.4. Handling Problems With Value Expansion

   If a problem occurs when expanding a construction variable, by default
   it is expanded to '' (an empty string), and will not cause scons to
   fail.
env = Environment()
print("value is: %s"%env.subst( '->$MISSING<-' ))

% scons -Q
value is: -><-
scons: `.' is up to date.

   This default behaviour can be changed using the AllowSubstExceptions
   function. When a problem occurs with a variable expansion it generates
   an exception, and the AllowSubstExceptions function controls which of
   these exceptions are actually fatal and which are allowed to occur
   safely. By default, NameError and IndexError are the two exceptions
   that are allowed to occur: so instead of causing scons to fail, these
   are caught, the variable expanded to '' and scons execution continues.
   To require that all construction variable names exist, and that indexes
   out of range are not allowed, call AllowSubstExceptions with no extra
   arguments.
AllowSubstExceptions()
env = Environment()
print("value is: %s"%env.subst( '->$MISSING<-' ))

% scons -Q

scons: *** NameError `name 'MISSING' is not defined' trying to evaluate `$MISSIN
G'
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 3, in <module>

   This can also be used to allow other exceptions that might occur, most
   usefully with the ${...} construction variable syntax. For example,
   this would allow zero-division to occur in a variable expansion in
   addition to the default exceptions allowed
AllowSubstExceptions(IndexError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError)
env = Environment()
print("value is: %s"%env.subst( '->${1 / 0}<-' ))

% scons -Q
value is: -><-
scons: `.' is up to date.

   If AllowSubstExceptions is called multiple times, each call completely
   overwrites the previous list of allowed exceptions.

7.2.5. Controlling the Default Construction Environment: the
DefaultEnvironment Function

   All of the Builder functions that we've introduced so far, like Program
   and Library, use a construction environment that contains settings for
   the various compilers and other tools that SCons configures by default,
   or otherwise knows about and has discovered on your system. If not
   invoked as methods of a specific construction environment, they use the
   default construction environment The goal of the default construction
   environment is to make many configurations "just work" to build
   software using readily available tools with a minimum of configuration
   changes.

   If needed, you can control the default construction environment by
   using the DefaultEnvironment function to initialize various settings by
   passing them as keyword arguments:
DefaultEnvironment(CC='/usr/local/bin/gcc')

   When configured as above, all calls to the Program or Object Builder
   will build object files with the /usr/local/bin/gcc compiler.

   The DefaultEnvironment function returns the initialized default
   construction environment object, which can then be manipulated like any
   other construction environment (note that the default environment works
   like a singleton - it can have only one instance - so the keyword
   arguments are processed only on the first call. On any subsequent call
   the existing object is returned). So the following would be equivalent
   to the previous example, setting the $CC variable to /usr/local/bin/gcc
   but as a separate step after the default construction environment has
   been initialized:
def_env = DefaultEnvironment()
def_env['CC'] = '/usr/local/bin/gcc'

   One very common use of the DefaultEnvironment function is to speed up
   SCons initialization. As part of trying to make most default
   configurations "just work," SCons will actually search the local system
   for installed compilers and other utilities. This search can take time,
   especially on systems with slow or networked file systems. If you know
   which compiler(s) and/or other utilities you want to configure, you can
   control the search that SCons performs by specifying some specific tool
   modules with which to initialize the default construction environment:
def_env = DefaultEnvironment(tools=['gcc', 'gnulink'], CC='/usr/local/bin/gcc')

   So the above example would tell SCons to explicitly configure the
   default environment to use its normal GNU Compiler and GNU Linker
   settings (without having to search for them, or any other utilities for
   that matter), and specifically to use the compiler found at
   /usr/local/bin/gcc.

7.2.6. Multiple Construction Environments

   The real advantage of construction environments is that you can create
   as many different ones as you need, each tailored to a different way to
   build some piece of software or other file. If, for example, we need to
   build one program with the -O2 flag and another with the -g (debug)
   flag, we would do this like so:
opt = Environment(CCFLAGS='-O2')
dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')

opt.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

dbg.Program('bar', 'bar.c')

% scons -Q
cc -o bar.o -c -g bar.c
cc -o bar bar.o
cc -o foo.o -c -O2 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

   We can even use multiple construction environments to build multiple
   versions of a single program. If you do this by simply trying to use
   the [299]Program builder with both environments, though, like this:
opt = Environment(CCFLAGS='-O2')
dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')

opt.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

dbg.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

   Then SCons generates the following error:
% scons -Q

scons: *** Two environments with different actions were specified for the same t
arget: foo.o
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 6, in <module>

   This is because the two Program calls have each implicitly told SCons
   to generate an object file named foo.o, one with a [300]$CCFLAGS value
   of -O2 and one with a [301]$CCFLAGS value of -g. SCons can't just
   decide that one of them should take precedence over the other, so it
   generates the error. To avoid this problem, we must explicitly specify
   that each environment compile foo.c to a separately-named object file
   using the [302]Object builder, like so:
opt = Environment(CCFLAGS='-O2')
dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')

o = opt.Object('foo-opt', 'foo.c')
opt.Program(o)

d = dbg.Object('foo-dbg', 'foo.c')
dbg.Program(d)

   Notice that each call to the Object builder returns a value, an
   internal SCons object that represents the object file that will be
   built. We then use that object as input to the Program builder. This
   avoids having to specify explicitly the object file name in multiple
   places, and makes for a compact, readable SConstruct file. Our SCons
   output then looks like:
% scons -Q
cc -o foo-dbg.o -c -g foo.c
cc -o foo-dbg foo-dbg.o
cc -o foo-opt.o -c -O2 foo.c
cc -o foo-opt foo-opt.o

7.2.7. Making Copies of Construction Environments: the Clone Method

   Sometimes you want more than one construction environment to share the
   same values for one or more variables. Rather than always having to
   repeat all of the common variables when you create each construction
   environment, you can use the [303]env.Clone method to create a copy of
   a construction environment.

   Like the [304]Environment call that creates a construction environment,
   the Clone method takes construction variable assignments, which will
   override the values in the copied construction environment. For
   example, suppose we want to use gcc to create three versions of a
   program, one optimized, one debug, and one with neither. We could do
   this by creating a "base" construction environment that sets [305]$CC
   to gcc, and then creating two copies, one which sets [306]$CCFLAGS for
   optimization and the other which sets $CCFLAGS for debugging:
env = Environment(CC='gcc')
opt = env.Clone(CCFLAGS='-O2')
dbg = env.Clone(CCFLAGS='-g')

env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

o = opt.Object('foo-opt', 'foo.c')
opt.Program(o)

d = dbg.Object('foo-dbg', 'foo.c')
dbg.Program(d)

   Then our output would look like:
% scons -Q
gcc -o foo.o -c foo.c
gcc -o foo foo.o
gcc -o foo-dbg.o -c -g foo.c
gcc -o foo-dbg foo-dbg.o
gcc -o foo-opt.o -c -O2 foo.c
gcc -o foo-opt foo-opt.o

7.2.8. Replacing Values: the Replace Method

   You can replace existing construction variable values using the
   [307]env.Replace method:
env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-DDEFINE1')
env.Replace(CCFLAGS='-DDEFINE2')
env.Program('foo.c')

   The replacing value (-DDEFINE2 in the above example) completely
   replaces the value in the construction environment:
% scons -Q
cc -o foo.o -c -DDEFINE2 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

   You can safely call Replace for construction variables that don't exist
   in the construction environment:
env = Environment()
env.Replace(NEW_VARIABLE='xyzzy')
print("NEW_VARIABLE = %s" % env['NEW_VARIABLE'])

   In this case, the construction variable simply gets added to the
   construction environment:
% scons -Q
NEW_VARIABLE = xyzzy
scons: `.' is up to date.

   Because the variables aren't expanded until the construction
   environment is actually used to build the targets, and because SCons
   function and method calls are order-independent, the last replacement
   "wins" and is used to build all targets, regardless of the order in
   which the calls to Replace() are interspersed with calls to builder
   methods:
env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-DDEFINE1')
print("CCFLAGS = %s" % env['CCFLAGS'])
env.Program('foo.c')

env.Replace(CCFLAGS='-DDEFINE2')
print("CCFLAGS = %s" % env['CCFLAGS'])
env.Program('bar.c')

   The timing of when the replacement actually occurs relative to when the
   targets get built becomes apparent if we run scons without the -Q
   option:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
CCFLAGS = -DDEFINE1
CCFLAGS = -DDEFINE2
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o bar.o -c -DDEFINE2 bar.c
cc -o bar bar.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DDEFINE2 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o
scons: done building targets.

   Because the replacement occurs while the SConscript files are being
   read, the [308]$CCFLAGS variable has already been set to -DDEFINE2 by
   the time the foo.o target is built, even though the call to the Replace
   method does not occur until later in the SConscript file.

7.2.9. Setting Values Only If They're Not Already Defined: the SetDefault
Method

   Sometimes it's useful to be able to specify that a construction
   variable should be set to a value only if the construction environment
   does not already have that variable defined You can do this with the
   [309]env.SetDefault method, which behaves similarly to the setdefault
   method of Python dictionary objects:
env.SetDefault(SPECIAL_FLAG='-extra-option')

   This is especially useful when writing your own Tool modules to apply
   variables to construction environments.

7.2.10. Appending to the End of Values: the Append Method

   You can append a value to an existing construction variable using the
   [310]env.Append method:
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=['MY_VALUE'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=['LAST'])
env.Program('foo.c')

   Note [311]$CPPDEFINES is the preferred way to set preprocessor defines,
   as SCons will generate the command line arguments using the correct
   prefix/suffix for the platform, leaving the usage portable. If you use
   [312]$CCFLAGS and [313]$SHCCFLAGS, you need to include them in their
   final form, which is less portable.
% scons -Q
cc -o foo.o -c -DMY_VALUE -DLAST foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

   If the construction variable doesn't already exist, the Append method
   will create it:
env = Environment()
env.Append(NEW_VARIABLE = 'added')
print("NEW_VARIABLE = %s"%env['NEW_VARIABLE'])

   Which yields:
% scons -Q
NEW_VARIABLE = added
scons: `.' is up to date.

   Note that the Append function tries to be "smart" about how the new
   value is appended to the old value. If both are strings, the previous
   and new strings are simply concatenated. Similarly, if both are lists,
   the lists are concatenated. If, however, one is a string and the other
   is a list, the string is added as a new element to the list.

7.2.11. Appending Unique Values: the AppendUnique Method

   Sometimes it's useful to add a new value only if the existing
   construction variable doesn't already contain the value. This can be
   done using the [314]env.AppendUnique method:
env.AppendUnique(CCFLAGS=['-g'])

   In the above example, the -g would be added only if the $CCFLAGS
   variable does not already contain a -g value.

7.2.12. Prepending to the Beginning of Values: the Prepend Method

   You can prepend a value to the beginning of an existing construction
   variable using the [315]env.Prepend method:
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=['MY_VALUE'])
env.Prepend(CPPDEFINES=['FIRST'])
env.Program('foo.c')

   SCons then generates the preprocessor define arguments from CPPDEFINES
   values with the correct prefix/suffix. For example on Linux or POSIX,
   the following arguments would be generated: -DFIRST and -DMY_VALUE
% scons -Q
cc -o foo.o -c -DFIRST -DMY_VALUE foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

   If the construction variable doesn't already exist, the Prepend method
   will create it:
env = Environment()
env.Prepend(NEW_VARIABLE='added')
print("NEW_VARIABLE = %s" % env['NEW_VARIABLE'])

   Which yields:
% scons -Q
NEW_VARIABLE = added
scons: `.' is up to date.

   Like the Append function, the Prepend function tries to be "smart"
   about how the new value is appended to the old value. If both are
   strings, the previous and new strings are simply concatenated.
   Similarly, if both are lists, the lists are concatenated. If, however,
   one is a string and the other is a list, the string is added as a new
   element to the list.

7.2.13. Prepending Unique Values: the PrependUnique Method

   Some times it's useful to add a new value to the beginning of a
   construction variable only if the existing value doesn't already
   contain the to-be-added value. This can be done using the
   [316]env.PrependUnique method:
env.PrependUnique(CCFLAGS=['-g'])

   In the above example, the -g would be added only if the $CCFLAGS
   variable does not already contain a -g value.

7.2.14. Overriding Construction Variable Settings

   Rather than creating a cloned construction environment for specific
   tasks, you can override or add construction variables when calling a
   builder method by passing them as keyword arguments. The values of
   these overridden or added variables will only be in effect when
   building that target, and will not affect other parts of the build. For
   example, if you want to add additional libraries for just one program:
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])

   or generate a shared library with a non-standard suffix:
env.SharedLibrary(
    target='word',
    source='word.cpp',
    SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx',
    LIBSUFFIXES=['.ocx'],
)

   When overriding this way, the Python keyword arguments in the builder
   call mean "set to this value". If you want your override to augment an
   existing value, you have to take some extra steps. Inside the builder
   call, it is possible to substitute in the existing value by using a
   string containing the variable name prefaced by a dollar sign ($).
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES="FOO")
env.Object(target="foo1.o", source="foo.c")
env.Object(target="foo2.o", source="foo.c", CPPDEFINES="BAR")
env.Object(target="foo3.o", source="foo.c", CPPDEFINES=["BAR", "$CPPDEFINES"])

   Which yields:
% scons -Q
cc -o foo1.o -c -DFOO foo.c
cc -o foo2.o -c -DBAR foo.c
cc -o foo3.o -c -DBAR -DFOO foo.c

   It is also possible to use the parse_flags keyword argument in an
   override to merge command-line style arguments into the appropriate
   construction variables. This works like the [317]env.MergeFlags method,
   which will be fully described in the next chapter.

   This example adds 'include' to [318]$CPPPATH, 'EBUG' to
   [319]$CPPDEFINES, and 'm' to [320]$LIBS:
env = Environment()
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

   So when executed:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -DEBUG -Iinclude hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o -lm

   Using temporary overrides this way is lighter weight than making a full
   construction environment, so it can help performance in large projects
   which have lots of special case values to set. However, keep in mind
   that this only works well when the targets are unique. Using builder
   overrides to try to build the same target with different sets of flags
   or other construction variables will lead to the scons: *** Two
   environments with different actions... error described in
   [321]Section 7.2.6, "Multiple Construction Environments" above. In this
   case you will actually want to create separate environments.

7.3. Controlling the Execution Environment for Issued Commands

   When SCons builds a target file, it does not execute the commands with
   the external environment that you used to execute SCons. Instead, it
   builds an execution environment from the values stored in the [322]$ENV
   construction variable and uses that for executing commands.

   The most important ramification of this behavior is that the PATH
   environment variable, which controls where the operating system will
   look for commands and utilities, will almost certainly not be the same
   as in the external environment from which you called SCons. This means
   that SCons might not necessarily find all of the tools that you can
   successfully execute from the command line.

   The default value of the PATH environment variable on a POSIX system is
   /usr/local/bin:/opt/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/snap/bin. The default value of
   the PATH environment variable on a Windows system comes from the
   Windows registry value for the command interpreter. If you want to
   execute any commands--compilers, linkers, etc.--that are not in these
   default locations, you need to set the PATH value in the $ENV
   dictionary in your construction environment.

   The simplest way to do this is to initialize explicitly the value when
   you create the construction environment; this is one way to do that:
path = ['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin']
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': path})

   Assigning a dictionary to the $ENV construction variable in this way
   completely resets the execution environment, so that the only variable
   that will be set when external commands are executed will be the PATH
   value. If you want to use the rest of the values in $ENV and only set
   the value of PATH, you can assign a value only to that variable:
env['ENV']['PATH'] = ['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin']

   Note that SCons does allow you to define the directories in the PATH in
   a string with paths separated by the pathname-separator character for
   your system (':' on POSIX systems, ';' on Windows).
env['ENV']['PATH'] = '/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin'

   But doing so makes your SConscript file less portable, since it will be
   correct only for the system type that matches the separator. You can
   use the Python os.pathsep for for greater portability - don't worry too
   much if this Python syntax doesn't make sense since there are other
   ways available:
import os
env['ENV']['PATH'] = os.pathsep.join(['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin'])

7.3.1. Propagating PATH From the External Environment

   You may want to propagate the external environment PATH to the
   execution environment for commands. You do this by initializing the
   PATH variable with the PATH value from the os.environ dictionary, which
   is Python's way of letting you get at the external environment:
import os
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})

   Alternatively, you may find it easier to just propagate the entire
   external environment to the execution environment for commands. This is
   simpler to code than explicity selecting the PATH value:
import os
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())

   Either of these will guarantee that SCons will be able to execute any
   command that you can execute from the command line. The drawback is
   that the build can behave differently if it's run by people with
   different PATH values in their environment--for example, if both the
   /bin and /usr/local/bin directories have different cc commands, then
   which one will be used to compile programs will depend on which
   directory is listed first in the user's PATH variable.

7.3.2. Adding to PATH Values in the Execution Environment

   One of the most common requirements for manipulating a variable in the
   execution environment is to add one or more custom directories to a
   path search variable like PATH on Linux or POSIX systems, or %PATH% on
   Windows, so that a locally-installed compiler or other utility can be
   found when SCons tries to execute it to update a target. SCons provides
   [323]env.PrependENVPath and [324]env.AppendENVPath functions to make
   adding things to execution variables convenient. You call these
   functions by specifying the variable to which you want the value added,
   and then value itself. So to add some /usr/local directories to the
   $PATH and $LIB variables, you might:
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())
env.PrependENVPath('PATH', '/usr/local/bin')
env.AppendENVPath('LIB', '/usr/local/lib')

   Note that the added values are strings, and if you want to add multiple
   directories to a variable like $PATH, you must include the path
   separator character in the string (: on Linux or POSIX, ; on Windows,
   or use os.pathsep for portability).

7.4. Using the toolpath for external Tools

7.4.1. The default tool search path

   Normally when using a tool from the construction environment, several
   different search locations are checked by default. This includes the
   SCons/Tools/ directory that is part of the scons distribution and the
   directory site_scons/site_tools relative to the root SConstruct file.
# Builtin tool or tool located within site_tools
env = Environment(tools=['SomeTool'])
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

# The search locations would include by default
SCons/Tool/SomeTool.py
SCons/Tool/SomeTool/__init__.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SomeTool.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SomeTool/__init__.py

7.4.2. Providing an external directory to toolpath

   In some cases you may want to specify a different location to search
   for tools. The [325]Environment function contains an option for this
   called toolpath This can be used to add additional search directories.
# Tool located within the toolpath directory option
env = Environment(
    tools=['SomeTool'],
    toolpath=['/opt/SomeToolPath', '/opt/SomeToolPath2']
)
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

# The search locations in this example would include:
/opt/SomeToolPath/SomeTool.py
/opt/SomeToolPath/SomeTool/__init__.py
/opt/SomeToolPath2/SomeTool.py
/opt/SomeToolPath2/SomeTool/__init__.py
SCons/Tool/SomeTool.py
SCons/Tool/SomeTool/__init__.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SomeTool.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SomeTool/__init__.py

7.4.3. Nested Tools within a toolpath

   Since SCons 3.0, a Builder may be located within a sub-directory /
   sub-package of the toolpath. This is similar to namespacing within
   Python. With nested or namespaced tools we can use the dot notation to
   specify a sub-directory that the tool is located under.
# namespaced target
env = Environment(
    tools=['SubDir1.SubDir2.SomeTool'],
    toolpath=['/opt/SomeToolPath']
)
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

# With this example the search locations would include
/opt/SomeToolPath/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool.py
/opt/SomeToolPath/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool/__init__.py
SCons/Tool/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool.py
SCons/Tool/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool/__init__.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool/__init__.py

7.4.4. Using sys.path within the toolpath

   If we want to access tools external to scons which are findable via
   sys.path (for example, tools installed via Python's pip package
   manager), it is possible to use sys.path with the toolpath. One thing
   to watch out for with this approach is that sys.path can sometimes
   contains paths to .egg files instead of directories. So we need to
   filter those out with this approach.
# namespaced target using sys.path within toolpath

searchpaths = []
for item in sys.path:
    if os.path.isdir(item):
        searchpaths.append(item)

env = Environment(
    tools=['someinstalledpackage.SomeTool'],
    toolpath=searchpaths
)
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

   By using sys.path with the toolpath argument and by using the nested
   syntax we can have scons search packages installed via pip for Tools.
# For Windows based on the python version and install directory, this may be som
ething like
C:\Python35\Lib\site-packages\someinstalledpackage\SomeTool.py
C:\Python35\Lib\site-packages\someinstalledpackage\SomeTool\__init__.py

# For Linux this could be something like:
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/someinstalledpackage/SomeTool.py
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/someinstalledpackage/SomeTool/__init__.py

7.4.5. Using the PyPackageDir function to add to the toolpath

   In some cases you may want to use a tool located within a installed
   external pip package. This is possible by the use of sys.path with the
   toolpath. However in that situation you need to provide a prefix to the
   toolname to indicate where it is located within sys.path.
searchpaths = []
for item in sys.path:
    if os.path.isdir(item):
        searchpaths.append(item)
env = Environment(
    tools=['tools_example.subdir1.subdir2.SomeTool'],
    toolpath=searchpaths
)
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

   To avoid the use of a prefix within the name of the tool or filtering
   sys.path for directories, we can use [326]PyPackageDir function to
   locate the directory of the python package. PyPackageDir returns a Dir
   object which represents the path of the directory for the python
   package / module specified as a parameter.
# namespaced target using sys.path
env = Environment(
    tools=['SomeTool'],
    toolpath=[PyPackageDir('tools_example.subdir1.subdir2')]
)
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

Chapter 8. Automatically Putting Command-line Options into their Construction
Variables

   This chapter describes the MergeFlags, ParseFlags, and ParseConfig
   methods of a construction environment, as well as the parse_flags
   keyword argument to methods that construct environments.

8.1. Merging Options into the Environment: the MergeFlags Function

   SCons construction environments have a [327]MergeFlags method that
   merges values from a passed-in argument into the construction
   environment. If the argument is a dictionary, MergeFlags treats each
   value in the dictionary as a list of options you would pass to a
   command (such as a compiler or linker). MergeFlags will not duplicate
   an option if it already exists in the construction variable. If the
   argument is a string, MergeFlags calls the [328]ParseFlags method to
   burst it out into a dictionary first, then acts on the result.

   MergeFlags tries to be intelligent about merging options, knowing that
   different construction variables may have different needs. When merging
   options to any variable whose name ends in PATH, MergeFlags keeps the
   leftmost occurrence of the option, because in typical lists of
   directory paths, the first occurrence "wins." When merging options to
   any other variable name, MergeFlags keeps the rightmost occurrence of
   the option, because in a list of typical command-line options, the last
   occurrence "wins."
env = Environment()
env.Append(CCFLAGS='-option -O3 -O1')
flags = {'CCFLAGS': '-whatever -O3'}
env.MergeFlags(flags)
print("CCFLAGS:", env['CCFLAGS'])

% scons -Q
CCFLAGS: ['-option', '-O1', '-whatever', '-O3']
scons: `.' is up to date.

   Note that the default value for [329]$CCFLAGS is an internal SCons
   object which automatically converts the options you specify as a string
   into a list.
env = Environment()
env.Append(CPPPATH=['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include'])
flags = {'CPPPATH': ['/usr/opt/include', '/usr/local/include']}
env.MergeFlags(flags)
print("CPPPATH:", env['CPPPATH'])

% scons -Q
CPPPATH: ['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include', '/usr/opt/include']
scons: `.' is up to date.

   Note that the default value for [330]$CPPPATH is a normal Python list,
   so you should give its values as a list in the dictionary you pass to
   the MergeFlags function.

   If MergeFlags is passed anything other than a dictionary, it calls the
   ParseFlags method to convert it into a dictionary.
env = Environment()
env.Append(CCFLAGS='-option -O3 -O1')
env.Append(CPPPATH=['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include'])
env.MergeFlags('-whatever -I/usr/opt/include -O3 -I/usr/local/include')
print("CCFLAGS:", env['CCFLAGS'])
print("CPPPATH:", env['CPPPATH'])

% scons -Q
CCFLAGS: ['-option', '-O1', '-whatever', '-O3']
CPPPATH: ['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include', '/usr/opt/include']
scons: `.' is up to date.

   In the combined example above, ParseFlags has sorted the options into
   their corresponding variables and returned a dictionary for MergeFlags
   to apply to the construction variables in the specified construction
   environment.

8.2. Merging Options While Creating Environment: the parse_flags Parameter

   It is also possible to merge construction variable values from
   arguments given to the [331]Environment call itself. If the parse_flags
   keyword argument is given, its value is distributed to construction
   variables in the new environment in the same way as described for the
   MergeFlags method. This also works when calling [332]env.Clone, as well
   as in overrides to builder methods (see [333]Section 7.2.14,
   "Overriding Construction Variable Settings").
env = Environment(parse_flags="-I/opt/include -L/opt/lib -lfoo")
for k in ('CPPPATH', 'LIBPATH', 'LIBS'):
    print("%s:" % k, env.get(k))
env.Program("f1.c")

% scons -Q
CPPPATH: ['/opt/include']
LIBPATH: ['/opt/lib']
LIBS: ['foo']
cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

8.3. Separating Compile Arguments into their Variables: the ParseFlags
Function

   SCons has a bewildering array of construction variables for different
   types of options when building programs. Sometimes you may not know
   exactly which variable should be used for a particular option.

   SCons construction environments have a [334]ParseFlags method that
   takes a set of typical command-line options and distributes them into
   the appropriate construction variables Historically, it was created to
   support the [335]ParseConfig method, so it focuses on options used by
   the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for the C and C++ toolchains.

   ParseFlags returns a dictionary containing the options distributed into
   their respective construction variables. Normally, this dictionary
   would then be passed to [336]MergeFlags to merge the options into a
   construction environment, but the dictionary can be edited if desired
   to provide additional functionality. (Note that if the flags are not
   going to be edited, calling MergeFlags with the options directly will
   avoid an additional step.)
env = Environment()
d = env.ParseFlags("-I/opt/include -L/opt/lib -lfoo")
for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
    if v:
        print(k, v)
env.MergeFlags(d)
env.Program("f1.c")

% scons -Q
CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
LIBS ['foo']
cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

   Note that if the options are limited to generic types like those above,
   they will be correctly translated for other platform types:
C:\>scons -Q
CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
LIBS ['foo']
cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo /I\opt\include
link /nologo /OUT:f1.exe /LIBPATH:\opt\lib foo.lib f1.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

   Since the assumption is that the flags are used for the GCC toolchain,
   unrecognized flags are placed in [337]$CCFLAGS so they will be used for
   both C and C++ compiles:
env = Environment()
d = env.ParseFlags("-whatever")
for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
    if v:
        print(k, v)
env.MergeFlags(d)
env.Program("f1.c")

% scons -Q
CCFLAGS -whatever
cc -o f1.o -c -whatever f1.c
cc -o f1 f1.o

   ParseFlags will also accept a (recursive) list of strings as input; the
   list is flattened before the strings are processed:
env = Environment()
d = env.ParseFlags(["-I/opt/include", ["-L/opt/lib", "-lfoo"]])
for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
    if v:
        print(k, v)
env.MergeFlags(d)
env.Program("f1.c")

% scons -Q
CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
LIBS ['foo']
cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

   If a string begins with a an exclamation mark (!), the string is passed
   to the shell for execution. The output of the command is then parsed:
env = Environment()
d = env.ParseFlags(["!echo -I/opt/include", "!echo -L/opt/lib", "-lfoo"])
for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
    if v:
        print(k, v)
env.MergeFlags(d)
env.Program("f1.c")

% scons -Q
CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
LIBS ['foo']
cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

   ParseFlags is regularly updated for new options; consult the man page
   for details about those currently recognized.

8.4. Finding Installed Library Information: the ParseConfig Function

   Configuring the right options to build programs to work with
   libraries--especially shared libraries--that are available on POSIX
   systems can be complex. To help this situation, various utilies with
   names that end in config return the command-line options for the GNU
   Compiler Collection (GCC) that are needed to build and link against
   those libraries; for example, the command-line options to use a library
   named lib could be found by calling a utility named lib-config.

   A more recent convention is that these options are available through
   the generic pkg-config program, providing a common framework, error
   handling, and the like, so that all the package creator has to do is
   provide the set of strings for his particular package.

   SCons construction variables have a [338]ParseConfig method that asks
   the host system to execute a command and then configures the
   appropriate construction variables based on the output of that command.
   This lets you run a program like pkg-config or a more specific utility
   to help set up your build.
env = Environment()
env['CPPPATH'] = ['/lib/compat']
env.ParseConfig("pkg-config x11 --cflags --libs")
print("CPPPATH:", env['CPPPATH'])

   SCons will execute the specified command string, parse the resultant
   flags, and add the flags to the appropriate environment variables.
% scons -Q
CPPPATH: ['/lib/compat', '/usr/X11/include']
scons: `.' is up to date.

   In the example above, SCons has added the include directory to
   [339]$CPPPATH (Depending upon what other flags are emitted by the
   pkg-config command, other variables may have been extended as well.)

   Note that the options are merged with existing options using the
   [340]MergeFlags method, so that each option only occurs once in the
   construction variable.
env = Environment()
env.ParseConfig("pkg-config x11 --cflags --libs")
env.ParseConfig("pkg-config x11 --cflags --libs")
print("CPPPATH:", "CPPPATH:", env['CPPPATH'])

% scons -Q
CPPPATH: ['/usr/X11/include']
scons: `.' is up to date.

Chapter 9. Controlling Build Output

   A key aspect of creating a usable build configuration is providing
   useful output from the build so its users can readily understand what
   the build is doing and get information about how to control the build.
   SCons provides several ways of controlling output from the build
   configuration to help make the build more useful and understandable.

9.1. Providing Build Help: the Help Function

   It's often very useful to be able to give users some help that
   describes the specific targets, build options, etc., that can be used
   for your build. SCons provides the Help function to allow you to
   specify this help text:
Help("""
Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
      'scons debug' to build the debug version.
""")

   Optionally, one can specify the append flag:
Help("""
Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
      'scons debug' to build the debug version.
""", append=True)

   (Note the above use of the Python triple-quote syntax, which comes in
   very handy for specifying multi-line strings like help text.)

   When the SConstruct or SConscript files contain such a call to the Help
   function, the specified help text will be displayed in response to the
   SCons -h option:
% scons -h
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.

Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
      'scons debug' to build the debug version.

Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   The SConscript files may contain multiple calls to the Help function,
   in which case the specified text(s) will be concatenated when
   displayed. This allows you to split up the help text across multiple
   SConscript files. In this situation, the order in which the SConscript
   files are called will determine the order in which the Help functions
   are called, which will determine the order in which the various bits of
   text will get concatenated.

   When used with AddOption Help("text", append=False) will clobber any
   help output associated with AddOption(). To preserve the help output
   from AddOption(), set append=True.

   Another use would be to make the help text conditional on some
   variable. For example, suppose you only want to display a line about
   building a Windows-only version of a program when actually run on
   Windows. The following SConstruct file:
env = Environment()

Help("\nType: 'scons program' to build the production program.\n")

if env['PLATFORM'] == 'win32':
    Help("\nType: 'scons windebug' to build the Windows debug version.\n")

   Will display the complete help text on Windows:
C:\>scons -h
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.

Type: 'scons program' to build the production program.

Type: 'scons windebug' to build the Windows debug version.

Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   But only show the relevant option on a Linux or UNIX system:
% scons -h
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.

Type: 'scons program' to build the production program.

Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   If there is no Help text in the SConstruct or SConscript files, SCons
   will revert to displaying its standard list that describes the SCons
   command-line options. This list is also always displayed whenever the
   -H option is used.

9.2. Controlling How SCons Prints Build Commands: the $*COMSTR Variables

   Sometimes the commands executed to compile object files or link
   programs (or build other targets) can get very long, long enough to
   make it difficult for users to distinguish error messages or other
   important build output from the commands themselves. All of the default
   $*COM variables that specify the command lines used to build various
   types of target files have a corresponding $*COMSTR variable that can
   be set to an alternative string that will be displayed when the target
   is built.

   For example, suppose you want to have SCons display a "Compiling"
   message whenever it's compiling an object file, and a "Linking" when
   it's linking an executable. You could write a SConstruct file that
   looks like:
env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling $TARGET",
                  LINKCOMSTR = "Linking $TARGET")
env.Program('foo.c')

   Which would then yield the output:
% scons -Q
Compiling foo.o
Linking foo

   SCons performs complete variable substitution on $*COMSTR variables, so
   they have access to all of the standard variables like $TARGET
   $SOURCES, etc., as well as any construction variables that happen to be
   configured in the construction environment used to build a specific
   target.

   Of course, sometimes it's still important to be able to see the exact
   command that SCons will execute to build a target. For example, you may
   simply need to verify that SCons is configured to supply the right
   options to the compiler, or a developer may want to cut-and-paste a
   compile command to add a few options for a custom test.

   One common way to give users control over whether or not SCons should
   print the actual command line or a short, configured summary is to add
   support for a VERBOSE command-line variable to your SConstruct file. A
   simple configuration for this might look like:
env = Environment()
if ARGUMENTS.get('VERBOSE') != '1':
    env['CCCOMSTR'] = "Compiling $TARGET"
    env['LINKCOMSTR'] = "Linking $TARGET"
env.Program('foo.c')

   By only setting the appropriate $*COMSTR variables if the user
   specifies VERBOSE=1 on the command line, the user has control over how
   SCons displays these particular command lines:
% scons -Q
Compiling foo.o
Linking foo
% scons -Q -c
Removed foo.o
Removed foo
% scons -Q VERBOSE=1
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

   A gentle reminder here: many of the commands for building come in
   pairs, depending on whether the intent is to build an object for use in
   a shared library or not. The command strings mirror this, so it may be
   necessary to set, for example, both CCCOMSTR and SHCCCOMSTR to get the
   desired results.

9.3. Providing Build Progress Output: the Progress Function

   Another aspect of providing good build output is to give the user
   feedback about what SCons is doing even when nothing is being built at
   the moment. This can be especially true for large builds when most of
   the targets are already up-to-date. Because SCons can take a long time
   making absolutely sure that every target is, in fact, up-to-date with
   respect to a lot of dependency files, it can be easy for users to
   mistakenly conclude that SCons is hung or that there is some other
   problem with the build.

   One way to deal with this perception is to configure SCons to print
   something to let the user know what it's "thinking about." The Progress
   function allows you to specify a string that will be printed for every
   file that SCons is "considering" while it is traversing the dependency
   graph to decide what targets are or are not up-to-date.
Progress('Evaluating $TARGET\n')
Program('f1.c')
Program('f2.c')

   Note that the Progress function does not arrange for a newline to be
   printed automatically at the end of the string (as does the Python
   print function), and we must specify the \n that we want printed at the
   end of the configured string. This configuration, then, will have SCons
   print that it is Evaluating each file that it encounters in turn as it
   traverses the dependency graph:
% scons -Q
Evaluating SConstruct
Evaluating f1.c
Evaluating f1.o
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
Evaluating f1
cc -o f1 f1.o
Evaluating f2.c
Evaluating f2.o
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
Evaluating f2
cc -o f2 f2.o
Evaluating .

   Of course, normally you don't want to add all of these additional lines
   to your build output, as that can make it difficult for the user to
   find errors or other important messages. A more useful way to display
   this progress might be to have the file names printed directly to the
   user's screen, not to the same standard output stream where build
   output is printed, and to use a carriage return character (\r) so that
   each file name gets re-printed on the same line. Such a configuration
   would look like:
Progress('$TARGET\r',
         file=open('/dev/tty', 'w'),
         overwrite=True)
Program('f1.c')
Program('f2.c')

   Note that we also specified the overwrite=True argument to the Progress
   function, which causes SCons to "wipe out" the previous string with
   space characters before printing the next Progress string. Without the
   overwrite=True argument, a shorter file name would not overwrite all of
   the charactes in a longer file name that precedes it, making it
   difficult to tell what the actual file name is on the output. Also note
   that we opened up the /dev/tty file for direct access (on POSIX) to the
   user's screen. On Windows, the equivalent would be to open the con:
   file name.

   Also, it's important to know that although you can use $TARGET to
   substitute the name of the node in the string, the Progress function
   does not perform general variable substitution (because there's not
   necessarily a construction environment involved in evaluating a node
   like a source file, for example).

   You can also specify a list of strings to the Progress function, in
   which case SCons will display each string in turn. This can be used to
   implement a "spinner" by having SCons cycle through a sequence of
   strings:
Progress(['-\r', '\\\r', '|\r', '/\r'], interval=5)
Program('f1.c')
Program('f2.c')

   Note that here we have also used the interval= keyword argument to have
   SCons only print a new "spinner" string once every five evaluated
   nodes. Using an interval= count, even with strings that use $TARGET
   like our examples above, can be a good way to lessen the work that
   SCons expends printing Progress strings, while still giving the user
   feedback that indicates SCons is still working on evaluating the build.

   Lastly, you can have direct control over how to print each evaluated
   node by passing a Python function (or other Python callable) to the
   Progress function. Your function will be called for each evaluated
   node, allowing you to implement more sophisticated logic like adding a
   counter:
screen = open('/dev/tty', 'w')
count = 0
def progress_function(node)
    count += 1
    screen.write('Node %4d: %s\r' % (count, node))

Progress(progress_function)

   Of course, if you choose, you could completely ignore the node argument
   to the function, and just print a count, or anything else you wish.

   (Note that there's an obvious follow-on question here: how would you
   find the total number of nodes that will be evaluated so you can tell
   the user how close the build is to finishing? Unfortunately, in the
   general case, there isn't a good way to do that, short of having SCons
   evaluate its dependency graph twice, first to count the total and the
   second time to actually build the targets. This would be necessary
   because you can't know in advance which target(s) the user actually
   requested to be built. The entire build may consist of thousands of
   Nodes, for example, but maybe the user specifically requested that only
   a single object file be built.)

9.4. Printing Detailed Build Status: the GetBuildFailures Function

   SCons, like most build tools, returns zero status to the shell on
   success and nonzero status on failure. Sometimes it's useful to give
   more information about the build status at the end of the run, for
   instance to print an informative message, send an email, or page the
   poor slob who broke the build.

   SCons provides a GetBuildFailures method that you can use in a python
   atexit function to get a list of objects describing the actions that
   failed while attempting to build targets. There can be more than one if
   you're using -j. Here's a simple example:
import atexit

def print_build_failures():
    from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
    for bf in GetBuildFailures():
        print("%s failed: %s" % (bf.node, bf.errstr))
atexit.register(print_build_failures)

   The atexit.register call registers print_build_failures as an atexit
   callback, to be called before SCons exits. When that function is
   called, it calls GetBuildFailures to fetch the list of failed objects.
   See the man page for the detailed contents of the returned objects;
   some of the more useful attributes are .node, .errstr, .filename, and
   .command. The filename is not necessarily the same file as the node;
   the node is the target that was being built when the error occurred,
   while the filenameis the file or dir that actually caused the error.
   Note: only call GetBuildFailures at the end of the build; calling it at
   any other time is undefined.

   Here is a more complete example showing how to turn each element of
   GetBuildFailures into a string:
# Make the build fail if we pass fail=1 on the command line
if ARGUMENTS.get('fail', 0):
    Command('target', 'source', ['/bin/false'])

def bf_to_str(bf):
    """Convert an element of GetBuildFailures() to a string
    in a useful way."""
    import SCons.Errors
    if bf is None: # unknown targets product None in list
        return '(unknown tgt)'
    elif isinstance(bf, SCons.Errors.StopError):
        return str(bf)
    elif bf.node:
        return str(bf.node) + ': ' + bf.errstr
    elif bf.filename:
        return bf.filename + ': ' + bf.errstr
    return 'unknown failure: ' + bf.errstr
import atexit

def build_status():
    """Convert the build status to a 2-tuple, (status, msg)."""
    from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
    bf = GetBuildFailures()
    if bf:
        # bf is normally a list of build failures; if an element is None,
        # it's because of a target that scons doesn't know anything about.
        status = 'failed'
        failures_message = "\n".join(["Failed building %s" % bf_to_str(x)
                           for x in bf if x is not None])
    else:
        # if bf is None, the build completed successfully.
        status = 'ok'
        failures_message = ''
    return (status, failures_message)

def display_build_status():
    """Display the build status.  Called by atexit.
    Here you could do all kinds of complicated things."""
    status, failures_message = build_status()
    if status == 'failed':
       print("FAILED!!!!")  # could display alert, ring bell, etc.
    elif status == 'ok':
       print("Build succeeded.")
    print(failures_message)

atexit.register(display_build_status)

   When this runs, you'll see the appropriate output:
% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.
Build succeeded.
% scons -Q fail=1
scons: *** [target] Source `source' not found, needed by target `target'.
FAILED!!!!
Failed building target: Source `source' not found, needed by target `target'.

Chapter 10. Controlling a Build From the Command Line

   SCons provides a number of ways for you as the writer of the SConscript
   files to give you (and your users) the ability to control the build
   execution. The arguments that can be specified on the command line are
   broken down into three types:

   Options
          Command-line options always begin with one or two - (hyphen)
          characters. SCons provides ways for you to examine and set
          options values from within your SConscript files, as well as the
          ability to define your own custom options. See
          [341]Section 10.1, "Command-Line Options", below.

   Variables
          Any command-line argument containing an = (equal sign) is
          considered a variable setting with the form variable=value.
          SCons provides direct access to all of the command-line variable
          settings, the ability to apply command-line variable settings to
          construction environments, and functions for configuring
          specific types of variables (Boolean values, path names, etc.)
          with automatic validation of the specified values. See
          [342]Section 10.2, "Command-Line variable=value Build
          Variables", below.

   Targets
          Any command-line argument that is not an option or a variable
          setting (does not begin with a hyphen and does not contain an
          equal sign) is considered a target that the you are telling
          SCons to build. SCons provides access to the list of specified
          targets, as well as ways to set the default list of targets from
          within the SConscript files. See [343]Section 10.3,
          "Command-Line Targets", below.

10.1. Command-Line Options

   SCons has many command-line options that control its behavior. An SCons
   command-line option always begins with one or two hyphen (-)
   characters.

10.1.1. Not Having to Specify Command-Line Options Each Time: the SCONSFLAGS
Environment Variable

   You may find yourself using the same command-line options every time
   you run SCons. For example, you might find it saves time to specify -j
   2 to have SCons run up to two build commands in parallel. To avoid
   having to type -j 2 by hand every time, you can set the external
   environment variable SCONSFLAGS to a string containing -j 2, as well as
   any other command-line options that you want SCons to always use.
   SCONSFLAGS is an exception to the usual rule that SCons itself avoids
   looking at environment variables from the shell you are running.

   If, for example, you are using a POSIX shell such as bash or zsh and
   you always want SCons to use the -Q option, you can set the SCONSFLAGS
   environment as follows:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
    ... [build output] ...
scons: done building targets.
% export SCONSFLAGS="-Q"
% scons
    ... [build output] ...

   For csh-style shells on POSIX systems you can set the SCONSFLAGS
   environment variable as follows:
$ setenv SCONSFLAGS "-Q"

   For the Windows command shell (cmd) you can set the SCONSFLAGS
   environment variable as follows:
C:\Users\foo> set SCONSFLAGS="-Q"

   To set SCONSFLAGS more permanently you can add the setting to the
   shell's startup file on POSIX systems, and on Windows you can use the
   System Properties control panel applet to select Environment Variables
   and set it there.

10.1.2. Getting Values Set by Command-Line Options: the GetOption Function

   SCons provides the [344]GetOption function to get the values set by the
   various command-line options.

   One use case for GetOption is to check whether or not the -h or --help
   option has been specified. Normally, SCons does not print its help text
   until after it has read all of the SConscript files, because it's
   possible that help text has been added by some subsidiary SConscript
   file deep in the source tree hierarchy. Of course, reading all of the
   SConscript files takes extra time. If you know that your configuration
   does not define any additional help text in subsidiary SConscript
   files, you can speed up displaying the command-line help by using the
   GetOption function to load the subsidiary SConscript files only if the
   -h or --help option has not been specified like this:
if not GetOption('help'):
    SConscript('src/SConscript', export='env')

   In general, the string that you pass to the GetOption function to fetch
   the value of a command-line option setting is the same as the "most
   common" long option name (beginning with two hyphen characters),
   although there are some exceptions. The list of SCons command-line
   options and the GetOption strings for fetching them, are available in
   the [345]Section 10.1.4, "Strings for Getting or Setting Values of
   SCons Command-Line Options" section, below.

   GetOption can be used to retrieve the values of options defined by
   calls to [346]AddOption. A GetOption call must appear after the
   AddOption call for that option. If the AddOption call supplied a dest
   keyword argument, a string with that name is what to pass as the
   argument to GetOption, otherwise it is a (possibly modified) version of
   the first long option name - see [347]AddOption.

10.1.3. Setting Values of Command-Line Options: the SetOption Function

   You can also set the values of SCons command-line options from within
   the SConscript files by using the [348]SetOption function. The strings
   that you use to set the values of SCons command-line options are
   available in the [349]Section 10.1.4, "Strings for Getting or Setting
   Values of SCons Command-Line Options" section, below.

   One use of the SetOption function is to specify a value for the -j or
   --jobs option, so that you get the improved performance of a parallel
   build without having to specify the option by hand. A complicating
   factor is that a good value for the -j option is somewhat
   system-dependent. One rough guideline is that the more processors your
   system has, the higher you want to set the -j value, in order to take
   advantage of the number of CPUs.

   For example, suppose the administrators of your development systems
   have standardized on setting a NUM_CPU environment variable to the
   number of processors on each system. A little bit of Python code to
   access the environment variable and the SetOption function provides the
   right level of flexibility:
import os

num_cpu = int(os.environ.get('NUM_CPU', 2))
SetOption('num_jobs', num_cpu)
print("running with -j %s" % GetOption('num_jobs'))

   The above snippet of code sets the value of the --jobs option to the
   value specified in the NUM_CPU environment variable. (This is one of
   the exception cases where the string is spelled differently from the
   from command-line option. The string for fetching or setting the --jobs
   value is num_jobs for historical reasons.) The code in this example
   prints the num_jobs value for illustrative purposes. It uses a default
   value of 2 to provide some minimal parallelism even on single-processor
   systems:
% scons -Q
running with -j 2
scons: `.' is up to date.

   But if the NUM_CPU environment variable is set, then use that for the
   default number of jobs:
% export NUM_CPU="4"
% scons -Q
running with -j 4
scons: `.' is up to date.

   But any explicit -j or --jobs value you specify on the command line is
   used first, regardless of whether or not the NUM_CPU environment
   variable is set:
% scons -Q -j 7
running with -j 7
scons: `.' is up to date.
% export NUM_CPU="4"
% scons -Q -j 3
running with -j 3
scons: `.' is up to date.

10.1.4. Strings for Getting or Setting Values of SCons Command-Line Options

   The strings that you can pass to the [350]GetOption and [351]SetOption
   functions usually correspond to the first long-form option name (that
   is, name beginning with two hyphen characters: --), after replacing any
   remaining hyphen characters with underscores.

   SetOption is not currently supported for options added with AddOption.

   The full list of strings and the variables they correspond to is as
   follows:
   String for GetOption and SetOption Command-Line Option(s)
   cache_debug --cache-debug
   cache_disable --cache-disable
   cache_force --cache-force
   cache_show --cache-show
   clean -c, --clean, --remove
   config --config
   directory -C, --directory
   diskcheck --diskcheck
   duplicate --duplicate
   file -f, --file, --makefile , --sconstruct
   help -h, --help
   ignore_errors --ignore-errors
   implicit_cache --implicit-cache
   implicit_deps_changed --implicit-deps-changed
   implicit_deps_unchanged --implicit-deps-unchanged
   interactive --interact, --interactive
   keep_going -k, --keep-going
   max_drift --max-drift
   no_exec -n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
   no_site_dir --no-site-dir
   num_jobs -j, --jobs
   profile_file --profile
   question -q, --question
   random --random
   repository -Y, --repository, --srcdir
   silent -s, --silent, --quiet
   site_dir --site-dir
   stack_size --stack-size
   taskmastertrace_file --taskmastertrace
   warn --warn --warning

10.1.5. Adding Custom Command-Line Options: the AddOption Function

   SCons also allows you to define your own command-line options with the
   [352]AddOption function. The AddOption function takes the same
   arguments as the add_option method from the standard Python library
   module optparse. ^[[353]2]

   Once you add a custom command-line option with the AddOption function,
   the value of the option (if any) is immediately available using the
   standard [354]GetOption function. The argument to GetOption must be the
   name of the variable which holds the option. If the dest keyword
   argument to AddOption is specified, the value is the variable name.
   given. If not given, it is the name (without the leading hyphens) of
   the first long option name given to AddOption after replacing any
   remaining hyphen characters with underscores, since hyphens are not
   legal in Python identifier names.

   SetOption is not currently supported for options added with AddOption.

   One useful example of using this functionality is to provide a --prefix
   to help describe where to install files:
AddOption(
    '--prefix',
    dest='prefix',
    type='string',
    nargs=1,
    action='store',
    metavar='DIR',
    help='installation prefix',
)

env = Environment(PREFIX=GetOption('prefix'))

installed_foo = env.Install('$PREFIX/usr/bin', 'foo.in')
Default(installed_foo)

   The above code uses the GetOption function to set the $PREFIX
   construction variable to a value you specify with a command-line option
   of --prefix. Because $PREFIX expands to a null string if it's not
   initialized, running SCons without the option of --prefix installs the
   file in the /usr/bin/ directory:
% scons -Q -n
Install file: "foo.in" as "/usr/bin/foo.in"

   But specifying --prefix=/tmp/install on the command line causes the
   file to be installed in the /tmp/install/usr/bin/ directory:
% scons -Q -n --prefix=/tmp/install
Install file: "foo.in" as "/tmp/install/usr/bin/foo.in"

Note

   Option-arguments separated from long options by whitespace, rather than
   by an =, cannot be correctly resolved by SCons. While --input=ARG is
   clearly opt followed by arg, for --input ARG it is not possible to tell
   without instructions whether ARG is an argument belonging to the input
   option or a positional argument. SCons treats positional arguments as
   either command-line build options or command-line targets which are
   made available for use in an SConscript (see the immediately following
   sections for details). Thus, they must be collected before SConscript
   processing takes place. Since AddOption calls, which provide the
   processing instructions to resolve any ambiguity, happen in an
   SConscript, SCons does not know in time for options added this way, and
   unexpected things happen, such as option-arguments assigned as targets
   and/or exceptions due to missing option-arguments.

   As a result, this usage style should be avoided when invoking scons.
   For single-argument options, use the --input=ARG form on the command
   line. For multiple-argument options (nargs greater than one), set nargs
   to one in AddOption calls and either: combine the option-arguments into
   one word with a separator, and parse the result in your own code (see
   the built-in --debug option, which allows specifying multiple arguments
   as a single comma-separated word, for an example of such usage); or
   allow the option to be specified multiple times by setting
   action='append'. Both methods can be supported at the same time.

10.2. Command-Line variable=value Build Variables

   You may want to control various aspects of your build by allowing
   variable=value values to be specified on the command line. For example,
   suppose you want to be able to build a debug version of a program by
   running SCons as follows:
% scons -Q debug=1

   SCons provides an ARGUMENTS dictionary that stores all of the
   variable=value assignments from the command line. This allows you to
   modify aspects of your build in response to specifications on the
   command line. (Note that unless you want to require a variable always
   be specified you probably want to use the Python dictionary get method,
   which allows you to designate a default value to be used if there is no
   specification on the command line.)

   The following code sets the [355]$CCFLAGS construction variable in
   response to the debug flag being set in the ARGUMENTS dictionary:
env = Environment()
debug = ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0)
if int(debug):
    env.Append(CCFLAGS='-g')
env.Program('prog.c')

   This results in the -g compiler option being used when debug=1 is used
   on the command line:
% scons -Q debug=0
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o
% scons -Q debug=0
scons: `.' is up to date.
% scons -Q debug=1
cc -o prog.o -c -g prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o
% scons -Q debug=1
scons: `.' is up to date.

   SCons keeps track of the precise command line used to build each object
   file, and as a result can determine that the object and executable
   files need rebuilding when the value of the debug argument has changed.

   The ARGUMENTS dictionary has two minor drawbacks. First, because it is
   a dictionary, it can only store one value for each specified keyword,
   and thus only "remembers" the last setting for each keyword on the
   command line. This makes the ARGUMENTS dictionary less than ideal if
   you want to allow specifying multiple values on the command line for a
   given keyword. Second, it does not preserve the order in which the
   variable settings were specified, which is a problem if you want the
   configuration to behave differently in response to the order in which
   the build variable settings were specified on the command line.

   To accomodate these requirements, SCons provides an ARGLIST variable
   that gives you direct access to variable=value settings on the command
   line, in the exact order they were specified, and without removing any
   duplicate settings. Each element in the ARGLIST variable is itself a
   two-element list containing the keyword and the value of the setting,
   and you must loop through, or otherwise select from, the elements of
   ARGLIST to process the specific settings you want in whatever way is
   appropriate for your configuration. For example, the following code
   lets you add to the CPPDEFINES construction variable by specifying
   multiple define= settings on the command line:
cppdefines = []
for key, value in ARGLIST:
    if key == 'define':
        cppdefines.append(value)
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=cppdefines)
env.Object('prog.c')

   Yields the following output:
% scons -Q define=FOO
cc -o prog.o -c -DFOO prog.c
% scons -Q define=FOO define=BAR
cc -o prog.o -c -DFOO -DBAR prog.c

   Note that the ARGLIST and ARGUMENTS variables do not interfere with
   each other, but rather provide slightly different views into how you
   specified variable=value settings on the command line. You can use both
   variables in the same SCons configuration. In general, the ARGUMENTS
   dictionary is more convenient to use, (since you can just fetch
   variable settings through Python dictionary access), and the ARGLIST
   list is more flexible (since you can examine the specific order in
   which the command-line variable settings were given).

10.2.1. Controlling Command-Line Build Variables

   Being able to use a command-line build variable like debug=1 is handy,
   but it can be a chore to write specific Python code to recognize each
   such variable, check for errors and provide appropriate messages, and
   apply the values to a construction variable. To help with this, SCons
   provides a Variables class to define such build variables easily, and a
   mechanism to apply the build variables to a construction environment.
   This allows you to control how the build variables affect construction
   environments.

   For example, suppose that you want to set a RELEASE construction
   variable on the command line whenever the time comes to build a program
   for release, and that the value of this variable should be added to the
   command line with the appropriate define to pass the value to the C
   compiler. Here's how you might do that by setting the appropriate value
   in a dictionary for the [356]$CPPDEFINES construction variable:
vars = Variables(None, ARGUMENTS)
vars.Add('RELEASE', default=0)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD': '${RELEASE}'})
env.Program(['foo.c', 'bar.c'])

   This SConstruct file first creates a Variables object which uses the
   values from the command-line options dictionary ARGUMENTS (the
   vars=Variables(None, ARGUMENTS) call). It then uses the object's Add
   method to indicate that the RELEASE variable can be set on the command
   line, and that if not set the default value is 0. The newly created
   Variables object is passed to the Environment call used to create the
   construction environment using a variables keyword argument. This then
   allows you to set the RELEASE build variable on the command line and
   have the variable show up in the command line used to build each object
   from a C source file:
% scons -Q RELEASE=1
cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 bar.c
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o bar.o

   Historical note: In old SCons (prior to 0.98.1), these build variables
   were known as "command-line build options." At that time, class was
   named Options and the predefined functions to construct options were
   named BoolOption, EnumOption, ListOption, PathOption, PackageOption and
   AddOptions (contrast with the current names in [357]Section 10.2.4,
   "Pre-Defined Build Variable Functions", below). You may encounter these
   names in older SConscript files, wiki pages, blog entries,
   StackExchange articles, etc. These old names no longer work, but a
   mental substitution of "Variable" for "Option" allows the concepts to
   transfer to current usage models.

10.2.2. Providing Help for Command-Line Build Variables

   To make command-line build variables most useful, you ideally want to
   provide some help text to describe the available variables when the you
   ask for help (run scons -h). You can write this text by hand, but SCons
   provides some assistance. Variables objects provide a GenerateHelpText
   method the generate text that describes the various variables that have
   been added to it. The default text includes the help string itself plus
   other information such as allowed values. (The generated text can also
   be customized by replacing the FormatVariableHelpText method). You then
   pass the output from this method to the Help function:
vars = Variables(None, ARGUMENTS)
vars.Add('RELEASE', help='Set to 1 to build for release', default=0)
env = Environment(variables=vars)
Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

   SCons now displays some useful text when the -h option is used:
% scons -Q -h

RELEASE: Set to 1 to build for release
    default: 0
    actual: 0

Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   You can see the help output shows the default value as well as the
   current actual value of the build variable.

10.2.3. Reading Build Variables From a File

   Being able to to specify the value of a build variable on the command
   line is useful, but can still become tedious if you have to specify the
   variable every time you run SCons. To make this easier, you can provide
   customized build variable settings in a local file by providing a file
   name when the Variables object is created:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add('RELEASE', help='Set to 1 to build for release', default=0)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD': '${RELEASE}'})
env.Program(['foo.c', 'bar.c'])
Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

   This then allows you to control the RELEASE variable by setting it in
   the custom.py file:
RELEASE = 1


   Note that this file is actually executed like a Python script. Now when
   you run SCons:
% scons -Q
cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 bar.c
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o bar.o

   And if you change the contents of custom.py to:
RELEASE = 0

   The object files are rebuilt appropriately with the new variable:
% scons -Q
cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 bar.c
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o bar.o

   Finally, you can combine both methods with:
vars = Variables('custom.py', ARGUMENTS)

   where values in the option file custom.py get overwritten by the ones
   specified on the command line.

10.2.4. Pre-Defined Build Variable Functions

   SCons provides a number of convenience functions that provide
   ready-made behaviors for various types of command-line build variables.
   These functions all return a tuple which is ready to be passed to the
   Add or AddVariables method call. You are of course free to define your
   own behaviors as well.

10.2.4.1. True/False Values: the BoolVariable Build Variable Function

   It is often handy to be able to specify a variable that controls a
   simple Boolean variable with a true or false value. It would be even
   more handy to accomodate different preferences for how to represent
   true or false values. The BoolVariable function makes it easy to
   accomodate these common representations of true or false.

   The BoolVariable function takes three arguments: the name of the build
   variable, the default value of the build variable, and the help string
   for the variable. It then returns appropriate information for passing
   to the Add method of a Variables object, like so:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(BoolVariable('RELEASE', help='Set to build for release', default=0))
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD': '${RELEASE}'})
env.Program('foo.c')

   With this build variable in place, the RELEASE variable can now be
   enabled by setting it to the value yes or t:
% scons -Q RELEASE=yes foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=True foo.c

% scons -Q RELEASE=t foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=True foo.c

   Other values that equate to true include y, 1, on and all.

   Conversely, RELEASE may now be given a false value by setting it to no
   or f:
% scons -Q RELEASE=no foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=False foo.c

% scons -Q RELEASE=f foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=False foo.c

   Other values that equate to false include n, 0, off and none.

   Lastly, if you try to specify any other value, SCons supplies an
   appropriate error message:
% scons -Q RELEASE=bad_value foo.o

scons: *** Error converting option: RELEASE
Invalid value for boolean option: bad_value
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 3, in <module>

10.2.4.2. Single Value From a Selection: the EnumVariable Build Variable
Function

   Suppose that you want to allow setting a COLOR variable that selects a
   background color to be displayed by an application, but that you want
   to restrict the choices to a specific set of allowed colors. You can
   set this up quite easily using the EnumVariable function, which takes a
   list of allowed_values in addition to the variable name, default value,
   and help text arguments:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    EnumVariable(
        'COLOR',
        help='Set background color',
        default='red',
        allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'COLOR': '"${COLOR}"'})
env.Program('foo.c')
Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

   You can now explicitly set the COLOR build variable to any of the
   specified allowed values:
% scons -Q COLOR=red foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="red" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=blue foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=green foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c

   But, importantly, an attempt to set COLOR to a value that's not in the
   list generates an error message:
% scons -Q COLOR=magenta foo.o

scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: magenta.  Valid values are: ('red', '
green', 'blue')
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 10, in <module>

   This example can also serve to further illustrate help generation: the
   help message here picks up not only the help text, but augments it with
   information gathered from allowed_values and default:
% scons -Q -h

COLOR: Set background color (red|green|blue)
    default: red
    actual: red

Use scons -H for help about command-line options.

   The EnumVariable function also provides a way to map alternate names to
   allowed values. Suppose, for example, you want to allow the word navy
   to be used as a synonym for blue. You do this by adding a map
   dictionary that maps its key values to the desired allowed value:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    EnumVariable(
        'COLOR',
        help='Set background color',
        default='red',
        allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
        map={'navy': 'blue'},
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'COLOR': '"${COLOR}"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

   Now you can supply navy on the command line, and SCons translates that
   into blue when it comes time to use the COLOR variable to build a
   target:
% scons -Q COLOR=navy foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c

   By default, when using the EnumVariable function, the allowed values
   are case-sensitive:
% scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o

scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: Red.  Valid values are: ('red', 'gree
n', 'blue')
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 10, in <module>
% scons -Q COLOR=BLUE foo.o

scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: BLUE.  Valid values are: ('red', 'gre
en', 'blue')
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 10, in <module>
% scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o

scons: *** Invalid value for option COLOR: nAvY.  Valid values are: ('red', 'gre
en', 'blue')
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 10, in <module>

   The EnumVariable function can take an additional ignorecase keyword
   argument that, when set to 1, tells SCons to allow case differences
   when the values are specified:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    EnumVariable(
        'COLOR',
        help='Set background color',
        default='red',
        allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
        map={'navy': 'blue'},
        ignorecase=1,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'COLOR': '"${COLOR}"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

   Which yields the output:
% scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="Red" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=BLUE foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="BLUE" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=green foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c

   Notice that an ignorecase value of 1 preserves the case-spelling
   supplied, only ignoring the case for matching. If you want SCons to
   translate the names into lower-case, regardless of the case used by the
   user, specify an ignorecase value of 2:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    EnumVariable(
        'COLOR',
        help='Set background color',
        default='red',
        allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
        map={'navy': 'blue'},
        ignorecase=2,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'COLOR': '"${COLOR}"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

   Now SCons uses values of red, green or blue regardless of how those
   values are spelled on the command line:
% scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="red" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=GREEN foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c

10.2.4.3. Multiple Values From a List: the ListVariable Build Variable
Function

   Another way in which you might want to control a build variable is to
   specify a list of allowed values, of which one or more can be chosen
   (where EnumVariable allows exactly one value to be chosen). SCons
   provides this through the ListVariable function. If, for example, you
   want to be able to set a COLORS variable to one or more of the allowed
   values:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    ListVariable(
        'COLORS', help='List of colors', default=0, names=['red', 'green', 'blue
']
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'COLORS': '"${COLORS}"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

   You can now specify a comma-separated list of allowed values, which get
   translated into a space-separated list for passing to the build
   commands:
% scons -Q COLORS=red,blue foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="red -Dblue" foo.c
% scons -Q COLORS=blue,green,red foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="blue -Dgreen -Dred" foo.c

   In addition, the ListVariable function lets you specify explicit
   keywords of all or none to select all of the allowed values, or none of
   them, respectively:
% scons -Q COLORS=all foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="red -Dgreen -Dblue" foo.c
% scons -Q COLORS=none foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="" foo.c

   And, of course, an illegal value still generates an error message:
% scons -Q COLORS=magenta foo.o

scons: *** Error converting option: COLORS
Invalid value(s) for option: magenta
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 7, in <module>

   You can use this last characteristic as a way to enforce at least one
   of your valid options being chosen by specifying the valid values with
   the names parameter and then giving a value not in that list as the
   default parameter - that way if no value is given on the command line,
   the default is chosen, SCons errors out as this is invalid. The example
   is, in fact, set up that way by using 0 as the default:
% scons -Q foo.o

scons: *** Error converting option: COLORS
Invalid value(s) for option: 0
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 7, in <module>

   This technique works for EnumVariable as well.

10.2.4.4. Path Names: the PathVariable Build Variable Function

   SCons provides a PathVariable function to make it easy to create a
   build variable to control an expected path name. If, for example, you
   need to define a preprocessor macro that controls the location of a
   configuration file:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    PathVariable(
        'CONFIG', help='Path to configuration file', default='/etc/my_config'
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'CONFIG_FILE': '"$CONFIG"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

   This allows you to override the CONFIG build variable on the command
   line as necessary:
% scons -Q foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCONFIG_FILE="/etc/my_config" foo.c
% scons -Q CONFIG=/usr/local/etc/other_config foo.o
scons: `foo.o' is up to date.

   By default, PathVariable checks to make sure that the specified path
   exists and generates an error if it doesn't:
% scons -Q CONFIG=/does/not/exist foo.o

scons: *** Path for option CONFIG does not exist: /does/not/exist
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 7, in <module>

   PathVariable provides a number of methods that you can use to change
   this behavior. If you want to ensure that any specified paths are, in
   fact, files and not directories, use the PathVariable.PathIsFile method
   as the validation function:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    PathVariable(
        'CONFIG',
        help='Path to configuration file',
        default='/etc/my_config',
        validator=PathVariable.PathIsFile,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'CONFIG_FILE': '"$CONFIG"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

   Conversely, to ensure that any specified paths are directories and not
   files, use the PathVariable.PathIsDir method as the validation
   function:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    PathVariable(
        'DBDIR',
        help='Path to database directory',
        default='/var/my_dbdir',
        validator=PathVariable.PathIsDir,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'DBDIR': '"$DBDIR"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

   If you want to make sure that any specified paths are directories, and
   you would like the directory created if it doesn't already exist, use
   the PathVariable.PathIsDirCreate method as the validation function:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    PathVariable(
        'DBDIR',
        help='Path to database directory',
        default='/var/my_dbdir',
        validator=PathVariable.PathIsDirCreate,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'DBDIR': '"$DBDIR"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

   Lastly, if you don't care whether the path exists, is a file, or a
   directory, use the PathVariable.PathAccept method to accept any path
   you supply:
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    PathVariable(
        'OUTPUT',
        help='Path to output file or directory',
        default=None,
        validator=PathVariable.PathAccept,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'OUTPUT': '"$OUTPUT"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

10.2.4.5. Enabled/Disabled Path Names: the PackageVariable Build Variable
Function

   Sometimes you want to give even more control over a path name variable,
   allowing them to be explicitly enabled or disabled by using yes or no
   keywords, in addition to allowing supplying an explicit path name.
   SCons provides the PackageVariable function to support this:
vars = Variables("custom.py")
vars.Add(
    PackageVariable("PACKAGE", help="Location package", default="/opt/location")
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={"PACKAGE": '"$PACKAGE"'})
env.Program("foo.c")

   When the SConscript file uses the PackageVariable function, you can
   still use the default or supply an overriding path name, but you can
   now explicitly set the specified variable to a value that indicates the
   package should be enabled (in which case the default should be used) or
   disabled:
% scons -Q foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="/opt/location" foo.c
% scons -Q PACKAGE=/usr/local/location foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="/usr/local/location" foo.c
% scons -Q PACKAGE=yes foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="True" foo.c
% scons -Q PACKAGE=no foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="False" foo.c

10.2.5. Adding Multiple Command-Line Build Variables at Once

   Lastly, SCons provides a way to add multiple build variables to a
   Variables object at once. Instead of having to call the Add method
   multiple times, you can call the AddVariables method with the build
   variables to be added to the object. Each build variable is specified
   as either a tuple of arguments, or as a call to one of the pre-defined
   functions for pre-packaged command-line build variables, which returns
   such a tuple. Note that an individual tuple cannot take keyword
   arguments in the way that a call to Add or one of the build variable
   functions can. The order of variables given to AddVariables does not
   matter.
vars = Variables()
vars.AddVariables(
    ('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0),
    ('CONFIG', 'Configuration file', '/etc/my_config'),
    BoolVariable('warnings', help='compilation with -Wall and similiar', default
=1),
    EnumVariable(
        'debug',
        help='debug output and symbols',
        default='no',
        allowed_values=('yes', 'no', 'full'),
        map={},
        ignorecase=0,
    ),
    ListVariable(
        'shared',
        help='libraries to build as shared libraries',
        default='all',
        names=list_of_libs,
    ),
    PackageVariable(
        'x11', help='use X11 installed here (yes = search some places)', default
='yes'
    ),
    PathVariable('qtdir', help='where the root of Qt is installed', default=qtdi
r),
)

10.2.6. Handling Unknown Command-Line Build Variables: the UnknownVariables
Function

   Humans, of course, occasionally misspell variable names in their
   command-line settings. SCons does not generate an error or warning for
   any unknown variables specified on the command line, because it can not
   reliably tell whether a given "misspelled" variable is really unknown
   and a potential problem or not. After all, you might be processing
   arguments directly using ARGUMENTS or ARGLIST with some Python code in
   your SConscript file.

   If, however, you are using a Variables object to define a specific set
   of command-line build variables that you expect to be able to set, you
   may want to provide an error message or warning of your own if a
   variable setting is specified that is not among the defined list of
   variable names known to the Variables object. You can do this by
   calling the UnknownVariables method of the Variables object to get the
   settings Variables did not recognize:
vars = Variables(None)
vars.Add('RELEASE', help='Set to 1 to build for release', default=0)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD': '${RELEASE}'})
unknown = vars.UnknownVariables()
if unknown:
    print("Unknown variables: %s" % " ".join(unknown.keys()))
    Exit(1)
env.Program('foo.c')

   The UnknownVariables method returns a dictionary containing the
   keywords and values of any variables specified on the command line that
   are not among the variables known to the Variables object (from having
   been specified using the Variables object's Add method). The example
   above, checks whether the dictionary returned by UnknownVariables is
   non-empty, and if so prints the Python list containing the names of the
   unknown variables and then calls the Exit function to terminate SCons:
% scons -Q NOT_KNOWN=foo
Unknown variables: NOT_KNOWN

   Of course, you can process the items in the dictionary returned by the
   UnknownVariables function in any way appropriate to your build
   configuration, including just printing a warning message but not
   exiting, logging an error somewhere, etc.

   Note that you must delay the call of UnknownVariables until after you
   have applied the Variables object to a construction environment with
   the variables= keyword argument of an Environment call: the variables
   in the object are not fully processed until this has happened.

10.3. Command-Line Targets

10.3.1. Fetching Command-Line Targets: the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS Variable

   SCons provides a COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable that lets you fetch the
   list of targets that were specified on the command line. You can use
   the targets to manipulate the build in any way you wish. As a simple
   example, suppose that you want to print a reminder whenever a specific
   program is built. You can do this by checking for the target in the
   COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS list:
if 'bar' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to copy `bar' to the archive!")
Default(Program('foo.c'))
Program('bar.c')

   Now, running SCons with the default target works as usual, but
   explicity specifying the bar target on the command line generates the
   warning message:
% scons -Q
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o
% scons -Q bar
Don't forget to copy `bar' to the archive!
cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
cc -o bar bar.o

   Another practical use for the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable might be to
   speed up a build by only reading certain subsidiary SConscript files if
   a specific target is requested.

10.3.2. Controlling the Default Targets: the Default Function

   You can control which targets SCons builds by default - that is, when
   there are no targets specified on the command line. As mentioned
   previously, SCons normally builds every target in or below the current
   directory unless you explicitly specify one or more targets on the
   command line. Sometimes, however, you may want to specify that only
   certain programs, or programs in certain directories, should be built
   by default. You do this with the Default function:
env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
env.Program('goodbye.c')
Default(hello)

   This SConstruct file knows how to build two programs, hello and
   goodbye, but only builds the hello program by default:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q
scons: `hello' is up to date.
% scons -Q goodbye
cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o

   Note that, even when you use the Default function in your SConstruct
   file, you can still explicitly specify the current directory (.) on the
   command line to tell SCons to build everything in (or below) the
   current directory:
% scons -Q .
cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   You can also call the Default function more than once, in which case
   each call adds to the list of targets to be built by default:
env = Environment()
prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
Default(prog1)
prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
prog3 = env.Program('prog3.c')
Default(prog3)

   Or you can specify more than one target in a single call to the Default
   function:
env = Environment()
prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
prog3 = env.Program('prog3.c')
Default(prog1, prog3)

   Either of these last two examples build only the prog1 and prog3
   programs by default:
% scons -Q
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o
cc -o prog3.o -c prog3.c
cc -o prog3 prog3.o
% scons -Q .
cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
cc -o prog2 prog2.o

   You can list a directory as an argument to Default:
env = Environment()
env.Program(['prog1/main.c', 'prog1/foo.c'])
env.Program(['prog2/main.c', 'prog2/bar.c'])
Default('prog1')

   In which case only the target(s) in that directory are built by
   default:
% scons -Q
cc -o prog1/foo.o -c prog1/foo.c
cc -o prog1/main.o -c prog1/main.c
cc -o prog1/main prog1/main.o prog1/foo.o
% scons -Q
scons: `prog1' is up to date.
% scons -Q .
cc -o prog2/bar.o -c prog2/bar.c
cc -o prog2/main.o -c prog2/main.c
cc -o prog2/main prog2/main.o prog2/bar.o

   Lastly, if for some reason you don't want any targets built by default,
   you can use the Python None variable:
env = Environment()
prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
Default(None)

   Which would produce build output like:
% scons -Q
scons: *** No targets specified and no Default() targets found.  Stop.
Found nothing to build
% scons -Q .
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o
cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
cc -o prog2 prog2.o

10.3.2.1. Fetching the List of Default Targets: the DEFAULT_TARGETS Variable

   SCons provides a DEFAULT_TARGETS variable that lets you get at the
   current list of default targets specified by calls to the Default
   function or method. The DEFAULT_TARGETS variable has two important
   differences from the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable. First, the
   DEFAULT_TARGETS variable is a list of internal SCons nodes, so you need
   to convert the list elements to strings if you want to print them or
   look for a specific target name. You can do this easily by calling the
   str on the elements in a list comprehension:
prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
Default(prog1)
print("DEFAULT_TARGETS is %s" % [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])

   (Keep in mind that all of the manipulation of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list
   takes place during the first phase when SCons is reading up the
   SConscript files, which is obvious if you leave off the -Q flag when
   you run SCons:)
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
DEFAULT_TARGETS is ['prog1']
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o
scons: done building targets.

   Second, the contents of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list changes in response to
   calls to the Default function, as you can see from the following
   SConstruct file:
prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
Default(prog1)
print("DEFAULT_TARGETS is now %s" % [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])
prog2 = Program('prog2.c')
Default(prog2)
print("DEFAULT_TARGETS is now %s" % [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])

   Which yields the output:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
DEFAULT_TARGETS is now ['prog1']
DEFAULT_TARGETS is now ['prog1', 'prog2']
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o
cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
cc -o prog2 prog2.o
scons: done building targets.

   In practice, this simply means that you need to pay attention to the
   order in which you call the Default function and refer to the
   DEFAULT_TARGETS list, to make sure that you don't examine the list
   before you have added the default targets you expect to find in it.

10.3.3. Fetching the List of Build Targets, Regardless of Origin: the
BUILD_TARGETS Variable

   You have already seen the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable, which contains
   a list of targets specified on the command line, and the
   DEFAULT_TARGETS variable, which contains a list of targets specified
   via calls to the Default method or function. Sometimes, however, you
   want a list of whatever targets SCons tries to build, regardless of
   whether the targets came from the command line or a Default call. You
   could code this up by hand, as follows:
if COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    targets = COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS
else:
    targets = DEFAULT_TARGETS

   SCons, however, provides a convenient BUILD_TARGETS variable that
   eliminates the need for this by-hand manipulation. Essentially, the
   BUILD_TARGETS variable contains a list of the command-line targets, if
   any were specified, and if no command-line targets were specified, it
   contains a list of the targets specified via the Default method or
   function.

   Because BUILD_TARGETS may contain a list of SCons nodes, you must
   convert the list elements to strings if you want to print them or look
   for a specific target name, just like the DEFAULT_TARGETS list:
prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
Program('prog2.c')
Default(prog1)
print("BUILD_TARGETS is %s" % [str(t) for t in BUILD_TARGETS])

   Notice how the value of BUILD_TARGETS changes depending on whether a
   target is specified on the command line - BUILD_TARGETS takes from
   DEFAULT_TARGETS only if there are no COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
% scons -Q
BUILD_TARGETS is ['prog1']
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o
% scons -Q prog2
BUILD_TARGETS is ['prog2']
cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
cc -o prog2 prog2.o
% scons -Q -c .
BUILD_TARGETS is ['.']
Removed prog1.o
Removed prog1
Removed prog2.o
Removed prog2

   subclass of optparse.OptionParser.

Chapter 11. Installing Files in Other Directories: the Install Builder

   Once a program is built, it is often appropriate to install it in
   another directory for public use. You use the Install method to arrange
   for a program, or any other file, to be copied into a destination
   directory:
env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)

   Note, however, that installing a file is still considered a type of
   file "build." This is important when you remember that the default
   behavior of SCons is to build files in or below the current directory.
   If, as in the example above, you are installing files in a directory
   outside of the top-level SConstruct file's directory tree, you must
   specify that directory (or a higher directory, such as /) for it to
   install anything there:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q /usr/bin
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

   It can, however, be cumbersome to remember (and type) the specific
   destination directory in which the program (or other file) should be
   installed. A call to Default can be used to add the directory to the
   list of default targets, removing the need to type it, but sometimes
   you don't want to install on every build. This is an area where the
   Alias function comes in handy, allowing you, for example, to create a
   pseudo-target named install that can expand to the specified
   destination directory:
env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   This then yields the more natural ability to install the program in its
   destination as a separate invocation, as follows:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q install
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

11.1. Installing Multiple Files in a Directory

   You can install multiple files into a directory simply by calling the
   Install function multiple times:
env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
env.Install('/usr/bin', goodbye)
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   Or, more succinctly, listing the multiple input files in a list (just
   like you can do with any other builder):
env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', [hello, goodbye])
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   Either of these two examples yields:
% scons -Q install
cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
Install file: "goodbye" as "/usr/bin/goodbye"
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

11.2. Installing a File Under a Different Name

   The Install method preserves the name of the file when it is copied
   into the destination directory. If you need to change the name of the
   file when you copy it, use the InstallAs function:
env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
env.InstallAs('/usr/bin/hello-new', hello)
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   This installs the hello program with the name hello-new as follows:
% scons -Q install
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello-new"

11.3. Installing Multiple Files Under Different Names

   If you have multiple files that all need to be installed with different
   file names, you can either call the InstallAs function multiple times,
   or as a shorthand, you can supply same-length lists for both the target
   and source arguments:
env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
env.InstallAs(['/usr/bin/hello-new',
               '/usr/bin/goodbye-new'],
               [hello, goodbye])
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   In this case, the InstallAs function loops through both lists
   simultaneously, and copies each source file into its corresponding
   target file name:
% scons -Q install
cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
Install file: "goodbye" as "/usr/bin/goodbye-new"
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello-new"

11.4. Installing a Shared Library

   If a shared library is created with the [359]$SHLIBVERSION variable
   set, scons will create symbolic links as needed based on that variable.
   To properly install such a library including the symbolic links, use
   the InstallVersionedLib function.

   For example, on a Linux system, this instruction:
foo =  env.SharedLibrary(target="foo", source="foo.c", SHLIBVERSION="1.2.3")

   Will produce a shared library libfoo.so.1.2.3 and symbolic links
   libfoo.so and libfoo.so.1 which point to libfoo.so.1.2.3. You can use
   the Node returned by the SharedLibrary builder in order to install the
   library and its symbolic links in one go without having to list them
   individually:
env.InstallVersionedLib(target="lib", source=foo)

   On systems which expect a shared library to be installed both with a
   name that indicates the version, for run-time resolution, and as a
   plain name, for link-time resolution, the InstallVersionedLib function
   can be used. Symbolic links appropriate to the type of system will be
   generated based on symlinks of the source library.

Chapter 12. Platform-Independent File System Manipulation

   SCons provides a number of platform-independent functions, called
   factories, that perform common file system manipulations like copying,
   moving or deleting files and directories, or making directories. These
   functions are factories because they don't perform the action at the
   time they're called, they each return an Action object that can be
   executed at the appropriate time.

12.1. Copying Files or Directories: The Copy Factory

   Suppose you want to arrange to make a copy of a file, and don't have a
   suitable pre-existing builder. ^[[360]3] One way would be to use the
   Copy action factory in conjunction with the Command builder:
Command("file.out", "file.in", Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"))

   Notice that the action returned by the Copy factory will expand the
   [361]$TARGET and [362]$SOURCE strings at the time file.out is built,
   and that the order of the arguments is the same as that of a builder
   itself--that is, target first, followed by source:
% scons -Q
Copy("file.out", "file.in")

   You can, of course, name a file explicitly instead of using $TARGET or
   $SOURCE:
Command("file.out", [], Copy("$TARGET", "file.in"))

   Which executes as:
% scons -Q
Copy("file.out", "file.in")

   The usefulness of the Copy factory becomes more apparent when you use
   it in a list of actions passed to the Command builder. For example,
   suppose you needed to run a file through a utility that only modifies
   files in-place, and can't "pipe" input to output. One solution is to
   copy the source file to a temporary file name, run the utility, and
   then copy the modified temporary file to the target, which the Copy
   factory makes extremely easy:
Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
        "modify tempfile",
        Copy("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
    ],
)

   The output then looks like:
% scons -Q
Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
modify tempfile
Copy("file.out", "tempfile")

   The Copy factory has a third optional argument which controls how
   symlinks are copied.

# Symbolic link shallow copied as a new symbolic link:
Command("LinkIn", "LinkOut", Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"[, True]))

# Symbolic link target copied as a file or directory:
Command("LinkIn", "FileOrDirectoryOut", Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE", False))

12.2. Deleting Files or Directories: The Delete Factory

   If you need to delete a file, then the Delete factory can be used in
   much the same way as the Copy factory. For example, if we want to make
   sure that the temporary file in our last example doesn't exist before
   we copy to it, we could add Delete to the beginning of the command
   list:
Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Delete("tempfile"),
        Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
        "modify tempfile",
        Copy("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
    ],
)

   Which then executes as follows:
% scons -Q
Delete("tempfile")
Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
modify tempfile
Copy("file.out", "tempfile")

   Of course, like all of these Action factories, the Delete factory also
   expands [363]$TARGET and [364]$SOURCE variables appropriately. For
   example:
Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Delete("$TARGET"),
        Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"),
    ],
)

   Executes as:
% scons -Q
Delete("file.out")
Copy("file.out", "file.in")

   Note, however, that you typically don't need to call the Delete factory
   explicitly in this way; by default, SCons deletes its target(s) for you
   before executing any action.

   One word of caution about using the Delete factory: it has the same
   variable expansions available as any other factory, including the
   $SOURCE variable. Specifying Delete("$SOURCE") is not something you
   usually want to do!

12.3. Moving (Renaming) Files or Directories: The Move Factory

   The Move factory allows you to rename a file or directory. For example,
   if we don't want to copy the temporary file, we could use:
Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
        "modify tempfile",
        Move("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
    ],
)

   Which would execute as:
% scons -Q
Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
modify tempfile
Move("file.out", "tempfile")

12.4. Updating the Modification Time of a File: The Touch Factory

   If you just need to update the recorded modification time for a file,
   use the Touch factory:
Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"),
        Touch("$TARGET"),
    ]
)

   Which executes as:
% scons -Q
Copy("file.out", "file.in")
Touch("file.out")

12.5. Creating a Directory: The Mkdir Factory

   If you need to create a directory, use the Mkdir factory. For example,
   if we need to process a file in a temporary directory in which the
   processing tool will create other files that we don't care about, you
   could use:
Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Delete("tempdir"),
        Mkdir("tempdir"),
        Copy("tempdir/${SOURCE.file}", "$SOURCE"),
        "process tempdir",
        Move("$TARGET", "tempdir/output_file"),
        Delete("tempdir"),
    ],
)

   Which executes as:
% scons -Q
Delete("tempdir")
Mkdir("tempdir")
Copy("tempdir/file.in", "file.in")
process tempdir
Move("file.out", "tempdir/output_file")
scons: *** [file.out] tempdir/output_file: No such file or directory

12.6. Changing File or Directory Permissions: The Chmod Factory

   To change permissions on a file or directory, use the Chmod factory.
   The permission argument uses POSIX-style permission bits and should
   typically be expressed as an octal, not decimal, number:
Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"),
        Chmod("$TARGET", 0o755),
    ]
)

   Which executes:
% scons -Q
Copy("file.out", "file.in")
Chmod("file.out", 0755)

12.7. Executing an action immediately: the Execute Function

   We've been showing you how to use Action factories in the Command
   function. You can also execute an Action returned by a factory (or
   actually, any Action) at the time the SConscript file is read by using
   the Execute function. For example, if we need to make sure that a
   directory exists before we build any targets,
Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/my_temp_directory'))

   Notice that this will create the directory while the SConscript file is
   being read:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Mkdir("/tmp/my_temp_directory")
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
scons: `.' is up to date.
scons: done building targets.

   If you're familiar with Python, you may wonder why you would want to
   use this instead of just calling the native Python os.mkdir() function.
   The advantage here is that the Mkdir action will behave appropriately
   if the user specifies the SCons -n or -q options--that is, it will
   print the action but not actually make the directory when -n is
   specified, or make the directory but not print the action when -q is
   specified.

   The Execute function returns the exit status or return value of the
   underlying action being executed. It will also print an error message
   if the action fails and returns a non-zero value. SCons will not,
   however, actually stop the build if the action fails. If you want the
   build to stop in response to a failure in an action called by Execute,
   you must do so by explicitly checking the return value and calling the
   Exit function (or a Python equivalent):
if Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/my_temp_directory')):
    # A problem occurred while making the temp directory.
    Exit(1)
   __________________________________________________________________

   ^[[365]3] Unfortunately, in the early days of SCons design, we used the
   name Copy for the function that returns a copy of the environment,
   otherwise that would be the logical choice for a Builder that copies a
   file or directory tree to a target location.

Chapter 13. Controlling Removal of Targets

   There are two occasions when SCons will, by default, remove target
   files. The first is when SCons determines that an target file needs to
   be rebuilt and removes the existing version of the target before
   executing The second is when SCons is invoked with the -c option to
   "clean" a tree of its built targets. These behaviours can be suppressed
   with the Precious and NoClean functions, respectively.

13.1. Preventing target removal during build: the Precious Function

   By default, SCons removes targets before building them. Sometimes,
   however, this is not what you want. For example, you may want to update
   a library incrementally, not by having it deleted and then rebuilt from
   all of the constituent object files. In such cases, you can use the
   Precious method to prevent SCons from removing the target before it is
   built:
  env = Environment(RANLIBCOM='')
  lib = env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
  env.Precious(lib)

   Although the output doesn't look any different, SCons does not, in
   fact, delete the target library before rebuilding it:
% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o

   SCons will, however, still delete files marked as Precious when the -c
   option is used.

13.2. Preventing target removal during clean: the NoClean Function

   By default, SCons removes all built targets when invoked with the -c
   option to clean a source tree of built targets. Sometimes, however,
   this is not what you want. For example, you may want to remove only
   intermediate generated files (such as object files), but leave the
   final targets (the libraries) untouched. In such cases, you can use the
   NoClean method to prevent SCons from removing a target during a clean:
env = Environment(RANLIBCOM='')
lib = env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
env.NoClean(lib)

   Notice that the libfoo.a is not listed as a removed file:
% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
% scons -c
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Cleaning targets ...
Removed f1.o
Removed f2.o
Removed f3.o
scons: done cleaning targets.

13.3. Removing additional files during clean: the Clean Function

   There may be additional files that you want removed when the -c option
   is used, but which SCons doesn't know about because they're not normal
   target files. For example, perhaps a command you invoke creates a log
   file as part of building the target file you want. You would like the
   log file cleaned, but you don't want to have to teach SCons that the
   command "builds" two files.

   You can use the Clean function to arrange for additional files to be
   removed when the -c option is used. Notice, however, that the Clean
   function takes two arguments, and the second argument is the name of
   the additional file you want cleaned (foo.log in this example):
t = Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', 'build -o $TARGET $SOURCE')
Clean(t, 'foo.log')

   The first argument is the target with which you want the cleaning of
   this additional file associated. In the above example, we've used the
   return value from the Command function, which represents the foo.out
   target. Now whenever the foo.out target is cleaned by the -c option,
   the foo.log file will be removed as well:
% scons -Q
build -o foo.out foo.in
% scons -Q -c
Removed foo.out
Removed foo.log

Chapter 14. Hierarchical Builds

   The source code for large software projects rarely stays in a single
   directory, but is nearly always divided into a hierarchy of
   directories. Organizing a large software build using SCons involves
   creating a hierarchy of build scripts using the SConscript function.

14.1. SConscript Files

   As we've already seen, the build script at the top of the tree is
   called SConstruct. The top-level SConstruct file can use the SConscript
   function to include other subsidiary scripts in the build. These
   subsidiary scripts can, in turn, use the SConscript function to include
   still other scripts in the build. By convention, these subsidiary
   scripts are usually named SConscript. For example, a top-level
   SConstruct file might arrange for four subsidiary scripts to be
   included in the build as follows:
SConscript(['drivers/display/SConscript',
            'drivers/mouse/SConscript',
            'parser/SConscript',
            'utilities/SConscript'])

   In this case, the SConstruct file lists all of the SConscript files in
   the build explicitly. (Note, however, that not every directory in the
   tree necessarily has an SConscript file.) Alternatively, the drivers
   subdirectory might contain an intermediate SConscript file, in which
   case the SConscript call in the top-level SConstruct file would look
   like:
SConscript(['drivers/SConscript',
            'parser/SConscript',
            'utilities/SConscript'])

   And the subsidiary SConscript file in the drivers subdirectory would
   look like:
SConscript(['display/SConscript',
            'mouse/SConscript'])

   Whether you list all of the SConscript files in the top-level
   SConstruct file, or place a subsidiary SConscript file in intervening
   directories, or use some mix of the two schemes, is up to you and the
   needs of your software.

14.2. Path Names Are Relative to the SConscript Directory

   Subsidiary SConscript files make it easy to create a build hierarchy
   because all of the file and directory names in a subsidiary SConscript
   files are interpreted relative to the directory in which the SConscript
   file lives. Typically, this allows the SConscript file containing the
   instructions to build a target file to live in the same directory as
   the source files from which the target will be built, making it easy to
   update how the software is built whenever files are added or deleted
   (or other changes are made).

   For example, suppose we want to build two programs prog1 and prog2 in
   two separate directories with the same names as the programs. One
   typical way to do this would be with a top-level SConstruct file like
   this:
SConscript(['prog1/SConscript', 'prog2/SConscript'])

   And subsidiary SConscript files that look like this:
env = Environment()
env.Program('prog1', ['main.c', 'foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])


   And this:
env = Environment()
env.Program('prog2', ['main.c', 'bar1.c', 'bar2.c'])


   Then, when we run SCons in the top-level directory, our build looks
   like:
% scons -Q
cc -o prog1/foo1.o -c prog1/foo1.c
cc -o prog1/foo2.o -c prog1/foo2.c
cc -o prog1/main.o -c prog1/main.c
cc -o prog1/prog1 prog1/main.o prog1/foo1.o prog1/foo2.o
cc -o prog2/bar1.o -c prog2/bar1.c
cc -o prog2/bar2.o -c prog2/bar2.c
cc -o prog2/main.o -c prog2/main.c
cc -o prog2/prog2 prog2/main.o prog2/bar1.o prog2/bar2.o

   Notice the following: First, you can have files with the same names in
   multiple directories, like main.c in the above example. Second, unlike
   standard recursive use of Make, SCons stays in the top-level directory
   (where the SConstruct file lives) and issues commands that use the path
   names from the top-level directory to the target and source files
   within the hierarchy.

14.3. Top-Relative Path Names in Subsidiary SConscript Files

   If you need to use a file from another directory, it's sometimes more
   convenient to specify the path to a file in another directory from the
   top-level SConstruct directory, even when you're using that file in a
   subsidiary SConscript file in a subdirectory. You can tell SCons to
   interpret a path name as relative to the top-level SConstruct
   directory, not the local directory of the SConscript file, by
   prepending a # (hash mark) in front of the path name:
env = Environment()
env.Program('prog', ['main.c', '#lib/foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   In this example, the lib directory is directly underneath the top-level
   SConstruct directory. If the above SConscript file is in a subdirectory
   named src/prog, the output would look like:
% scons -Q
cc -o lib/foo1.o -c lib/foo1.c
cc -o src/prog/foo2.o -c src/prog/foo2.c
cc -o src/prog/main.o -c src/prog/main.c
cc -o src/prog/prog src/prog/main.o lib/foo1.o src/prog/foo2.o

   (Notice that the lib/foo1.o object file is built in the same directory
   as its source file. See [366]Chapter 15, Separating Source and Build
   Trees: Variant Directories, below, for information about how to build
   the object file in a different subdirectory.)

   A couple of notes on top-relative paths:
    1. SCons doesn't care whether you add a slash after the #. Some people
       consider '#/lib/foo1.c' more readable than '#lib/foo1.c', but
       they're functionally equivalent.
    2. The top-relative syntax is only evaluated by SCons, the Python
       language itself does not understand about it. This becomes
       immediately obvious if you like to use print for debugging, or
       write a Python function that wants to evaluate a path. You can
       force SCons to evaluate a top-relative path by creating a Node
       object from it:

path = "#/include"

print("path =", path)
print("force-interpreted path =", Entry(path))

   Which shows:
% scons -Q
path = #/include
force-interpreted path = include
scons: `.' is up to date.

14.4. Absolute Path Names

   Of course, you can always specify an absolute path name for a file--for
   example:
env = Environment()
env.Program('prog', ['main.c', '/usr/joe/lib/foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

   Which, when executed, would yield:
% scons -Q
cc -o src/prog/foo2.o -c src/prog/foo2.c
cc -o src/prog/main.o -c src/prog/main.c
cc -o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o -c /usr/joe/lib/foo1.c
cc -o src/prog/prog src/prog/main.o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o src/prog/foo2.o

   (As was the case with top-relative path names, notice that the
   /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o object file is built in the same directory as its
   source file. See [367]Chapter 15, Separating Source and Build Trees:
   Variant Directories, below, for information about how to build the
   object file in a different subdirectory.)

14.5. Sharing Environments (and Other Variables) Between SConscript Files

   In the previous example, each of the subsidiary SConscript files
   created its own construction environment by calling [368]Environment
   separately. This obviously works fine, but if each program must be
   built with the same construction variables, it's cumbersome and
   error-prone to initialize separate construction environments in the
   same way over and over in each subsidiary SConscript file.

   SCons supports the ability to export variables from an SConscript file
   so they can be imported by other SConscript files, thus allowing you to
   share common initialized values throughout your build hierarchy.

14.5.1. Exporting Variables

   There are two ways to export a variable from an SConscript file. The
   first way is to call the [369]Export function. Export is pretty
   flexible - in the simplest form, you pass it a string that represents
   the name of the variable, and Export stores that with its value:
env = Environment()
Export('env')

   You may export more than one variable name at a time:
env = Environment()
debug = ARGUMENTS['debug']
Export('env', 'debug')

   Because a Python identifier cannot contain spaces, Export assumes a
   string containing spaces is is a shortcut for multiple variable names
   to export and splits it up for you:
env = Environment()
debug = ARGUMENTS['debug']
Export('env debug')

   You can also pass Export a dictionary of values. This form allows the
   opportunity to export a variable from the current scope under a
   different name - in this example, the value of foo is exported under
   the name "bar":
env = Environment()
foo = "FOO"
args = {"env": env, "bar": foo}
Export(args)

   Export will also accept arguments in keyword style. This form adds the
   ability to create exported variables that have not actually been set
   locally in the SConscript file. When used this way, the key is the
   intended variable name, not a string representation as with the other
   forms:
Export(MODE="DEBUG", TARGET="arm")

   The styles can be mixed, though Python function calling syntax requires
   all non-keyword arguments to precede any keyword arguments in the call.

   The Export function adds the variables to a global location from which
   other SConscript files can import. Calls to Export are cumulative. When
   you call Export you are actually updating a Python dictionary, so it is
   fine to export a variable you have already exported, but when doing so,
   the previous value is lost.

   The other way to export is you can specify a list of variables as a
   second argument to the [370]SConscript function call:
SConscript('src/SConscript', 'env')

   Or (preferably, for readability) using the exports keyword argument:
SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='env')

   These calls export the specified variables to only the listed
   SConscript file(s). You may specify more than one SConscript file in a
   list:
SConscript(['src1/SConscript',
            'src2/SConscript'], exports='env')

   This is functionally equivalent to calling the SConscript function
   multiple times with the same exports argument, one per SConscript file.

14.5.2. Importing Variables

   Once a variable has been exported from a calling SConscript file, it
   may be used in other SConscript files by calling the [371]Import
   function:
Import('env')
env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   The Import call makes the previously defined env variable available to
   the SConscript file. Assuming env is a construction environment, after
   import it can be used to build programs, libraries, etc. The use case
   of passing around a construction environment is extremely common in
   larger scons builds.

   Like the Export function, the Import function can be called with
   multiple variable names:
Import('env', 'debug')
env = env.Clone(DEBUG=debug)
env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   In this example, we pull in the common construction environment env,
   and use the value of the debug variable to make a modified copy by
   passing that to a [372]Clone call.

   The Import function will (like Export) split a string containing
   white-space into separate variable names:
Import('env debug')
env = env.Clone(DEBUG=debug)
env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   Import prefers a local definition to a global one, so that if there is
   a global export of foo, and the calling SConscript has exported foo to
   this SConscript, the import will find the foo exported to this
   SConscript.

   Lastly, as a special case, you may import all of the variables that
   have been exported by supplying an asterisk to the Import function:
Import('*')
env = env.Clone(DEBUG=debug)
env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

   If you're dealing with a lot of SConscript files, this can be a lot
   simpler than keeping arbitrary lists of imported variables up to date
   in each file.

14.5.3. Returning Values From an SConscript File

   Sometimes, you would like to be able to use information from a
   subsidiary SConscript file in some way. For example, suppose that you
   want to create one library from object files built by several
   subsidiary SConscript files. You can do this by using the [373]Return
   function to return values from the subsidiary SConscript files to the
   calling file. Like Import and Export, Return takes a string
   representation of the variable name, not the variable name itself.

   If, for example, we have two subdirectories foo and bar that should
   each contribute an object file to a library, what we'd like to be able
   to do is collect the object files from the subsidiary SConscript calls
   like this:
env = Environment()
Export('env')
objs = []
for subdir in ['foo', 'bar']:
    o = SConscript('%s/SConscript' % subdir)
    objs.append(o)
env.Library('prog', objs)

   We can do this by using the Return function in the foo/SConscript file
   like this:
Import('env')
obj = env.Object('foo.c')
Return('obj')


   (The corresponding bar/SConscript file should be pretty obvious.) Then
   when we run SCons, the object files from the subsidiary subdirectories
   are all correctly archived in the desired library:
% scons -Q
cc -o bar/bar.o -c bar/bar.c
cc -o foo/foo.o -c foo/foo.c
ar rc libprog.a foo/foo.o bar/bar.o
ranlib libprog.a

Chapter 15. Separating Source and Build Trees: Variant Directories

   It's often useful to keep any built files completely separate from the
   source files. Consider if you have a project to build software for a
   variety of different controller hardware. The boards are able to share
   a lot of code, so it makes sense to keep them in the same source tree,
   but certain build options in the source code and header files differ.
   If you build "Controller A" first, then "Controller B", on the
   "Controller B" build everything would have to be rebuilt, because SCons
   recognizes that the build instructions are different from those used in
   the "Controller A" build for each target - the build instructions are
   part of SCons's out-of-date calculation. Now when you go back and build
   for "Controller A", things have to be rebuilt from scratch again for
   the same reason. However, if you can separate the locations of the
   output files, this problem can be avoided. You can even set up to do
   both builds in one invocation of SCons.

   You can enable this separation by establishing one or more variant
   directory trees that are used to perform the build in, and thus provide
   a unique home for object files, libraries, and executable programs,
   etc. for a specific flavor, or variant, of build. SCons tracks targets
   by their path, so when the variant directory is included, objects
   belonging to "Controller A" can have different build instructions than
   those belonging to "Controller B" without triggering ping-ponging
   rebuilds.

   SCons provides two ways to do this, one through the [374]SConscript
   function that we've already seen, and the second through a more
   flexible [375]VariantDir function.

   Historical note: the VariantDir function used to be called BuildDir, a
   name which was removed because the SCons functionality differs from a
   familiar model of a "build directory" implemented by other build
   systems like GNU Autotools. You might still find references to the old
   name on the Internet in postings about SCons, but it no longer works.

15.1. Specifying a Variant Directory Tree as Part of an SConscript Call

   The most straightforward way to establish a variant directory tree
   relies the fact that the usual way to set up a build hierarchy is to
   have an SConscript file in the source subdirectory. If you pass a
   variant_dir argument to the [376]SConscript function call:
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build')

   SCons will then build all of the files in the build subdirectory:
% ls src
SConscript  hello.c
% scons -Q
cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% ls src
SConscript  hello.c
% ls build
SConscript  hello  hello.c  hello.o

   No files were built in src, they went to build. The build output might
   show a bit of a surprise: the object file build/hello.o and the
   executable file build/hello were built in the build subdirectory, as
   expected. But even though our hello.c file lives in the src
   subdirectory, SCons has actually compiled a build/hello.c file to
   create the object file, and that file is now seen in build.

   What's happened is that SCons has duplicated the hello.c file from the
   src subdirectory to the build subdirectory, and built the program from
   there (it also duplicated SConscript). The next section explains why
   SCons does this.

15.2. Why SCons Duplicates Source Files in a Variant Directory Tree

   The important thing to understand is that when you set up a variant
   directory, SCons performs the build in that directory. It turns out
   it's easiest to ensure where build products end up by just building in
   place. Since the build is happening in a place different from where the
   sources are, the most straightforward way to guarantee a correct build
   is for SCons to copy them there.

   The most direct reason to duplicate source files in variant directories
   is simply that some tools (mostly older versions) are written to only
   build their output files in the same directory as the source files. In
   this case, the choices are either to build the output file in the
   source directory and move it to the variant directory, or to duplicate
   the source files in the variant directory.

   Additionally, relative references between files can cause problems if
   we don't just duplicate the hierarchy of source files in the variant
   directory. You can see this at work in use of the C preprocessor
   #include mechanism with double quotes, not angle brackets:
#include "file.h"

   The de facto standard behavior for most C compilers in this case is to
   first look in the same directory as the source file that contains the
   #include line, then to look in the directories in the preprocessor
   search path. Add to this that the SCons implementation of support for
   code repositories (described below) means not all of the files will be
   found in the same directory hierarchy, and the simplest way to make
   sure that the right include file is found is to duplicate the source
   files into the variant directory, which provides a correct build
   regardless of the original location(s) of the source files.

   Although source-file duplication guarantees a correct build even in
   these end-cases, it can usually be safely disabled. The next section
   describes how you can disable the duplication of source files in the
   variant directory.

15.3. Telling SCons to Not Duplicate Source Files in the Variant Directory
Tree

   In most cases and with most tool sets, SCons can place its target files
   in a build subdirectory without duplicating the source files and
   everything will work just fine. You can disable the default SCons
   behavior by specifying duplicate=False when you call the SConscript
   function:
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build', duplicate=False)

   When this flag is specified, SCons uses the variant directory like most
   people expect--that is, the output files are placed in the variant
   directory while the source files stay in the source directory:
% ls src
SConscript
hello.c
% scons -Q
cc -c src/hello.c -o build/hello.o
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% ls build
hello
hello.o

15.4. The VariantDir Function

   Use the VariantDir function to establish that target files should be
   built in a separate directory from the source files:
VariantDir('build', 'src')
env = Environment()
env.Program('build/hello.c')

   Note that when you're not using an SConscript file in the src
   subdirectory, you must actually specify that the program must be built
   from the build/hello.c file that SCons will duplicate in the build
   subdirectory.

   When using the VariantDir function directly, SCons still duplicates the
   source files in the variant directory by default:
% ls src
hello.c
% scons -Q
cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% ls build
hello  hello.c  hello.o

   You can specify the same duplicate=False argument that you can specify
   for an SConscript call:
VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=False)
env = Environment()
env.Program('build/hello.c')

   In which case SCons will disable duplication of the source files:
% ls src
hello.c
% scons -Q
cc -o build/hello.o -c src/hello.c
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% ls build
hello  hello.o

15.5. Using VariantDir With an SConscript File

   Even when using the VariantDir function, it's more natural to use it
   with a subsidiary SConscript file, because then you don't have to
   adjust your individual build instructions to use the variant directory
   path. For example, if the src/SConscript looks like this:
env = Environment()
env.Program('hello.c')

   Then our SConstruct file could look like:
VariantDir('build', 'src')
SConscript('build/SConscript')


   Yielding the following output:
% ls src
SConscript  hello.c
% scons -Q
cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% ls build
SConscript  hello  hello.c  hello.o

   Notice that this is completely equivalent to the use of SConscript that
   we learned about in the previous section.

15.6. Using Glob with VariantDir

   The [377]Glob file name pattern matching function works just as usual
   when using VariantDir. For example, if the src/SConscript looks like
   this:
env = Environment()
env.Program('hello', Glob('*.c'))

   Then with the same SConstruct file as in the previous section, and
   source files f1.c and f2.c in src, we would see the following output:
% ls src
SConscript  f1.c  f2.c  f2.h
% scons -Q
cc -o build/f1.o -c build/f1.c
cc -o build/f2.o -c build/f2.c
cc -o build/hello build/f1.o build/f2.o
% ls build
SConscript  f1.c  f1.o  f2.c  f2.h  f2.o  hello

   The Glob function returns Nodes in the build/ tree, as you'd expect.

15.7. Variant Build Examples

   The variant_dir keyword argument of the SConscript function provides
   everything we need to show how easy it is to create variant builds
   using SCons. Suppose, for example, that we want to build a program for
   both Windows and Linux platforms, but that we want to build it in
   directory on a network share with separate side-by-side build
   directories for the Windows and Linux versions of the program. We have
   to do a little bit of work to construct paths, to make sure unwanted
   location dependencies don't creep in. The top-relative path reference
   can be useful here. To avoid writing conditional code based on
   platform, we can build the variant_dir path dynamically:
platform = ARGUMENTS.get('OS', Platform())

include = "#export/$PLATFORM/include"
lib = "#export/$PLATFORM/lib"
bin = "#export/$PLATFORM/bin"

env = Environment(
    PLATFORM=platform,
    BINDIR=bin,
    INCDIR=include,
    LIBDIR=lib,
    CPPPATH=[include],
    LIBPATH=[lib],
    LIBS='world',
)

Export('env')

env.SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/$PLATFORM')

   This SConstruct file, when run on a Linux system, yields:
% scons -Q OS=linux
Install file: "build/linux/world/world.h" as "export/linux/include/world.h"
cc -o build/linux/hello/hello.o -c -Iexport/linux/include build/linux/hello/hell
o.c
cc -o build/linux/world/world.o -c -Iexport/linux/include build/linux/world/worl
d.c
ar rc build/linux/world/libworld.a build/linux/world/world.o
ranlib build/linux/world/libworld.a
Install file: "build/linux/world/libworld.a" as "export/linux/lib/libworld.a"
cc -o build/linux/hello/hello build/linux/hello/hello.o -Lexport/linux/lib -lwor
ld
Install file: "build/linux/hello/hello" as "export/linux/bin/hello"

   The same SConstruct file on Windows would build:
C:\>scons -Q OS=windows
Install file: "build/windows/world/world.h" as "export/windows/include/world.h"
cl /Fobuild\windows\hello\hello.obj /c build\windows\hello\hello.c /nologo /Iexp
ort\windows\include
cl /Fobuild\windows\world\world.obj /c build\windows\world\world.c /nologo /Iexp
ort\windows\include
lib /nologo /OUT:build\windows\world\world.lib build\windows\world\world.obj
Install file: "build/windows/world/world.lib" as "export/windows/lib/world.lib"
link /nologo /OUT:build\windows\hello\hello.exe /LIBPATH:export\windows\lib worl
d.lib build\windows\hello\hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)
Install file: "build/windows/hello/hello.exe" as "export/windows/bin/hello.exe"

   In order to build several variants at once when using the variant_dir
   argument to SConscript, you can call the function repeatedely - this
   example does so in a loop. Note that the [378]SConscript trick of
   passing a list of script files, or a list of source directories, does
   not work with variant_dir, SCons allows only a single SConscript to be
   given if variant_dir is used.
env = Environment(OS=ARGUMENTS.get('OS'))
for os in ['newell', 'post']:
    SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/' + os)

Chapter 16. Building From Code Repositories

   Often, a software project will have one or more central repositories,
   directory trees that contain source code, or derived files, or both.
   You can eliminate additional unnecessary rebuilds of files by having
   SCons use files from one or more code repositories to build files in
   your local build tree.

16.1. The Repository Method

   It's often useful to allow multiple programmers working on a project to
   build software from source files and/or derived files that are stored
   in a centrally-accessible repository, a directory copy of the source
   code tree. (Note that this is not the sort of repository maintained by
   a source code management system like BitKeeper, CVS, or Subversion.)
   You use the Repository method to tell SCons to search one or more
   central code repositories (in order) for any source files and derived
   files that are not present in the local build tree:
env = Environment()
env.Program('hello.c')
Repository('/usr/repository1', '/usr/repository2')

   Multiple calls to the Repository method will simply add repositories to
   the global list that SCons maintains, with the exception that SCons
   will automatically eliminate the current directory and any non-existent
   directories from the list.

16.2. Finding source files in repositories

   The above example specifies that SCons will first search for files
   under the /usr/repository1 tree and next under the /usr/repository2
   tree. SCons expects that any files it searches for will be found in the
   same position relative to the top-level directory. In the above
   example, if the hello.c file is not found in the local build tree,
   SCons will search first for a /usr/repository1/hello.c file and then
   for a /usr/repository2/hello.c file to use in its place.

   So given the SConstruct file above, if the hello.c file exists in the
   local build directory, SCons will rebuild the hello program as normal:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   If, however, there is no local hello.c file, but one exists in
   /usr/repository1, SCons will recompile the hello program from the
   source file it finds in the repository:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c /usr/repository1/hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   And similarly, if there is no local hello.c file and no
   /usr/repository1/hello.c, but one exists in /usr/repository2:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c /usr/repository2/hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

16.3. Finding #include files in repositories

   We've already seen that SCons will scan the contents of a source file
   for #include file names and realize that targets built from that source
   file also depend on the #include file(s). For each directory in the
   [379]$CPPPATH list, SCons will actually search the corresponding
   directories in any repository trees and establish the correct
   dependencies on any #include files that it finds in repository
   directory.

   Unless the C compiler also knows about these directories in the
   repository trees, though, it will be unable to find the #include files.
   If, for example, the hello.c file in our previous example includes the
   hello.h in its current directory, and the hello.h only exists in the
   repository:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
hello.c:1: hello.h: No such file or directory

   In order to inform the C compiler about the repositories, SCons will
   add appropriate -I flags to the compilation commands for each directory
   in the $CPPPATH list. So if we add the current directory to the
   construction environment $CPPPATH like so:
env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
env.Program('hello.c')
Repository('/usr/repository1')

   Then re-executing SCons yields:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -I. -I/usr/repository1 hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   The order of the -I options replicates, for the C preprocessor, the
   same repository-directory search path that SCons uses for its own
   dependency analysis. If there are multiple repositories and multiple
   $CPPPATH directories, SCons will add the repository directories to the
   beginning of each $CPPPATH directory, rapidly multiplying the number of
   -I flags. If, for example, the $CPPPATH contains three directories (and
   shorter repository path names!):
env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['dir1', 'dir2', 'dir3'])
env.Program('hello.c')
Repository('/r1', '/r2')

   Then we'll end up with nine -I options on the command line, three (for
   each of the $CPPPATH directories) times three (for the local directory
   plus the two repositories):
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -Idir1 -I/r1/dir1 -I/r2/dir1 -Idir2 -I/r1/dir2 -I/r2/dir2 -Idir
3 -I/r1/dir3 -I/r2/dir3 hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

16.3.1. Limitations on #include files in repositories

   SCons relies on the C compiler's -I options to control the order in
   which the preprocessor will search the repository directories for
   #include files. This causes a problem, however, with how the C
   preprocessor handles #include lines with the file name included in
   double-quotes.

   As we've seen, SCons will compile the hello.c file from the repository
   if it doesn't exist in the local directory. If, however, the hello.c
   file in the repository contains a #include line with the file name in
   double quotes:
#include "hello.h"
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf(HELLO_MESSAGE);
    return (0);
}

   Then the C preprocessor will always use a hello.h file from the
   repository directory first, even if there is a hello.h file in the
   local directory, despite the fact that the command line specifies -I as
   the first option:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -I. -I/usr/repository1 /usr/repository1/hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   This behavior of the C preprocessor--always search for a #include file
   in double-quotes first in the same directory as the source file, and
   only then search the -I--can not, in general, be changed. In other
   words, it's a limitation that must be lived with if you want to use
   code repositories in this way. There are three ways you can possibly
   work around this C preprocessor behavior:
    1. Some modern versions of C compilers do have an option to disable or
       control this behavior. If so, add that option to [380]$CFLAGS (or
       [381]$CXXFLAGS or both) in your construction environment(s). Make
       sure the option is used for all construction environments that use
       C preprocessing!
    2. Change all occurrences of #include "file.h" to #include <file.h>.
       Use of #include with angle brackets does not have the same
       behavior--the -I directories are searched first for #include
       files--which gives SCons direct control over the list of
       directories the C preprocessor will search.
    3. Require that everyone working with compilation from repositories
       check out and work on entire directories of files, not individual
       files. (If you use local wrapper scripts around your source code
       control system's command, you could add logic to enforce this
       restriction there.

16.4. Finding the SConstruct file in repositories

   SCons will also search in repositories for the SConstruct file and any
   specified SConscript files. This poses a problem, though: how can SCons
   search a repository tree for an SConstruct file if the SConstruct file
   itself contains the information about the pathname of the repository?
   To solve this problem, SCons allows you to specify repository
   directories on the command line using the -Y option:
% scons -Q -Y /usr/repository1 -Y /usr/repository2

   When looking for source or derived files, SCons will first search the
   repositories specified on the command line, and then search the
   repositories specified in the SConstruct or SConscript files.

16.5. Finding derived files in repositories

   If a repository contains not only source files, but also derived files
   (such as object files, libraries, or executables), SCons will perform
   its normal MD5 signature calculation to decide if a derived file in a
   repository is up-to-date, or the derived file must be rebuilt in the
   local build directory. For the SCons signature calculation to work
   correctly, a repository tree must contain the .sconsign files that
   SCons uses to keep track of signature information.

   Usually, this would be done by a build integrator who would run SCons
   in the repository to create all of its derived files and .sconsign
   files, or who would run SCons in a separate build directory and copy
   the resulting tree to the desired repository:
% cd /usr/repository1
% scons -Q
cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o file1.o file2.o

   (Note that this is safe even if the SConstruct file lists
   /usr/repository1 as a repository, because SCons will remove the current
   build directory from its repository list for that invocation.)

   Now, with the repository populated, we only need to create the one
   local source file we're interested in working with at the moment, and
   use the -Y option to tell SCons to fetch any other files it needs from
   the repository:
% cd $HOME/build
% edit hello.c
% scons -Q -Y /usr/repository1
cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o /usr/repository1/file1.o /usr/repository1/file2.o

   Notice that SCons realizes that it does not need to rebuild local
   copies file1.o and file2.o files, but instead uses the already-compiled
   files from the repository.

16.6. Guaranteeing local copies of files

   If the repository tree contains the complete results of a build, and we
   try to build from the repository without any files in our local tree,
   something moderately surprising happens:
% mkdir $HOME/build2
% cd $HOME/build2
% scons -Q -Y /usr/all/repository hello
scons: `hello' is up-to-date.

   Why does SCons say that the hello program is up-to-date when there is
   no hello program in the local build directory? Because the repository
   (not the local directory) contains the up-to-date hello program, and
   SCons correctly determines that nothing needs to be done to rebuild
   that up-to-date copy of the file.

   There are, however, many times when you want to ensure that a local
   copy of a file always exists. A packaging or testing script, for
   example, may assume that certain generated files exist locally. To tell
   SCons to make a copy of any up-to-date repository file in the local
   build directory, use the Local function:
env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
Local(hello)

   If we then run the same command, SCons will make a local copy of the
   program from the repository copy, and tell you that it is doing so:
% scons -Y /usr/all/repository hello
Local copy of hello from /usr/all/repository/hello
scons: `hello' is up-to-date.

   (Notice that, because the act of making the local copy is not
   considered a "build" of the hello file, SCons still reports that it is
   up-to-date.)

Chapter 17. Extending SCons: Writing Your Own Builders

   Although SCons provides many useful methods for building common
   software products (programs, libraries, documents, etc.), you
   frequently want to be able to build some other type of file not
   supported directly by SCons. Fortunately, SCons makes it very easy to
   define your own Builder objects for any custom file types you want to
   build. (In fact, the SCons interfaces for creating Builder objects are
   flexible enough and easy enough to use that all of the the SCons
   built-in Builder objects are created using the mechanisms described in
   this section.)

17.1. Writing Builders That Execute External Commands

   The simplest Builder to create is one that executes an external
   command. For example, if we want to build an output file by running the
   contents of the input file through a command named foobuild, creating
   that Builder might look like:
bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')

   All the above line does is create a free-standing Builder object. The
   next section will show how to actually use it.

17.2. Attaching a Builder to a Construction Environment

   A Builder object isn't useful until it's attached to a construction
   environment so that we can call it to arrange for files to be built.
   This is done through the [382]$BUILDERS construction variable in an
   environment. The [383]$BUILDERS variable is a Python dictionary that
   maps the names by which you want to call various Builder objects to the
   objects themselves. For example, if we want to call the Builder we just
   defined by the name Foo, our SConstruct file might look like:
bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})

   With the Builder attached to our construction environment with the name
   Foo, we can now actually call it like so:
env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')

   Then when we run SCons it looks like:
% scons -Q
foobuild < file.input > file.foo

   Note, however, that the default $BUILDERS variable in a construction
   environment comes with a default set of Builder objects already
   defined: [384]Program, [385]Library, etc. And when we explicitly set
   the $BUILDERS variable when we create the construction environment, the
   default Builders are no longer part of the environment:
bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
env.Program('hello.c')

% scons -Q
AttributeError: 'SConsEnvironment' object has no attribute 'Program':
  File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 7:
    env.Program('hello.c')

   To be able to use both our own defined Builder objects and the default
   Builder objects in the same construction environment, you can either
   add to the [386]$BUILDERS variable using the Append function:
env = Environment()
bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env.Append(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
env.Program('hello.c')

   Or you can explicitly set the appropriately-named key in the $BUILDERS
   dictionary:
env = Environment()
bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env['BUILDERS']['Foo'] = bld
env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
env.Program('hello.c')

   Either way, the same construction environment can then use both the
   newly-defined Foo Builder and the default [387]Program Builder:
% scons -Q
foobuild < file.input > file.foo
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

17.3. Letting SCons Handle The File Suffixes

   By supplying additional information when you create a Builder, you can
   let SCons add appropriate file suffixes to the target and/or the source
   file. For example, rather than having to specify explicitly that you
   want the Foo Builder to build the file.foo target file from the
   file.input source file, you can give the .foo and .input suffixes to
   the Builder, making for more compact and readable calls to the Foo
   Builder:
bld = Builder(
    action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET',
    suffix='.foo',
    src_suffix='.input',
)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file1')
env.Foo('file2')

% scons -Q
foobuild < file1.input > file1.foo
foobuild < file2.input > file2.foo

   You can also supply a prefix keyword argument if it's appropriate to
   have SCons append a prefix to the beginning of target file names.

17.4. Builders That Execute Python Functions

   In SCons, you don't have to call an external command to build a file.
   You can, instead, define a Python function that a Builder object can
   invoke to build your target file (or files). Such a builder function
   definition looks like:
def build_function(target, source, env):
    # Code to build "target" from "source"
    return None

   The arguments of a builder function are:

   target
          A list of Node objects representing the target or targets to be
          built by this function. The file names of these target(s) may be
          extracted using the Python str function.

   source
          A list of Node objects representing the sources to be used by
          this function to build the targets. The file names of these
          source(s) may be extracted using the Python str function.

   env
          The construction environment used for building the target(s).
          The function may use any of the environment's construction
          variables in any way to affect how it builds the targets.

   The function will be constructed as a SCons FunctionAction and must
   return a 0 or None value if the target(s) are built successfully. The
   function may raise an exception or return any non-zero value to
   indicate that the build is unsuccessful. For more information on
   Actions see the Action Objects section of the man page.

   Once you've defined the Python function that will build your target
   file, defining a Builder object for it is as simple as specifying the
   name of the function, instead of an external command, as the Builder's
   action argument:
def build_function(target, source, env):
    # Code to build "target" from "source"
    return None

bld = Builder(
    action=build_function,
    suffix='.foo',
    src_suffix='.input',
)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file')

   And notice that the output changes slightly, reflecting the fact that a
   Python function, not an external command, is now called to build the
   target file:
% scons -Q
build_function(["file.foo"], ["file.input"])

17.5. Builders That Create Actions Using a Generator

   SCons Builder objects can create an action "on the fly" by using a
   function called a Generator. (Note: this is not the same thing as a
   Python generator function described in [388]PEP 255) This provides a
   great deal of flexibility to construct just the right list of commands
   to build your target. A generator looks like:
def generate_actions(source, target, env, for_signature):
    return 'foobuild < %s > %s' % (target[0], source[0])

   The arguments of a generator are:

   source
          A list of Node objects representing the sources to be built by
          the command or other action generated by this function. The file
          names of these source(s) may be extracted using the Python str
          function.

   target
          A list of Node objects representing the target or targets to be
          built by the command or other action generated by this function.
          The file names of these target(s) may be extracted using the
          Python str function.

   env
          The construction environment used for building the target(s).
          The generator may use any of the environment's construction
          variables in any way to determine what command or other action
          to return.

   for_signature
          A flag that specifies whether the generator is being called to
          contribute to a build signature, as opposed to actually
          executing the command.

   The generator must return a command string or other action that will be
   used to build the specified target(s) from the specified source(s).

   Once you've defined a generator, you create a Builder to use it by
   specifying the generator keyword argument instead of action.
def generate_actions(source, target, env, for_signature):
    return 'foobuild < %s > %s' % (source[0], target[0])

bld = Builder(
    generator=generate_actions,
    suffix='.foo',
    src_suffix='.input',
)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file')

% scons -Q
foobuild < file.input > file.foo

   Note that it's illegal to specify both an action and a generator for a
   Builder.

17.6. Builders That Modify the Target or Source Lists Using an Emitter

   SCons supports the ability for a Builder to modify the lists of
   target(s) from the specified source(s). You do this by defining an
   emitter function that takes as its arguments the list of the targets
   passed to the builder, the list of the sources passed to the builder,
   and the construction environment. The emitter function should return
   the modified lists of targets that should be built and sources from
   which the targets will be built.

   For example, suppose you want to define a Builder that always calls a
   foobuild program, and you want to automatically add a new target file
   named new_target and a new source file named new_source whenever it's
   called. The SConstruct file might look like this:
def modify_targets(target, source, env):
    target.append('new_target')
    source.append('new_source')
    return target, source

bld = Builder(
    action='foobuild $TARGETS - $SOURCES',
    suffix='.foo',
    src_suffix='.input',
    emitter=modify_targets,
)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file')

   And would yield the following output:
% scons -Q
foobuild file.foo new_target - file.input new_source

   One very flexible thing that you can do is use a construction variable
   to specify different emitter functions for different construction
   environments. To do this, specify a string containing a construction
   variable expansion as the emitter when you call the [389]Builder
   function, and set that construction variable to the desired emitter
   function in different construction environments:
bld = Builder(
    action='./my_command $SOURCES > $TARGET',
    suffix='.foo',
    src_suffix='.input',
    emitter='$MY_EMITTER',
)

def modify1(target, source, env):
    return target, source + ['modify1.in']

def modify2(target, source, env):
    return target, source + ['modify2.in']

env1 = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld}, MY_EMITTER=modify1)
env2 = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld}, MY_EMITTER=modify2)
env1.Foo('file1')
env2.Foo('file2')

   In this example, the modify1.in and modify2.in files get added to the
   source lists of the different commands:
% scons -Q
./my_command file1.input modify1.in > file1.foo
./my_command file2.input modify2.in > file2.foo

17.7. Modifying a Builder by adding an Emitter

   Defining an emitter to work with a custom Builder is a powerful
   concept, but sometimes all you really want is to be able to use an
   existing builder but change its concept of what targets are created. In
   this case, trying to recreate the logic of an existing Builder to
   supply a special emitter can be a lot of work. The typical case for
   this is when you want to use a compiler flag that causes additional
   files to be generated. For example the GNU linker accepts an option
   -Map which outputs a link map to the file specified by the option's
   argument. If this option is just supplied to the build, SCons will not
   consider the link map file a tracked target, which has various
   undesirable efffects.

   To help with this, SCons provides construction variables which
   correspond to a few standard builders: [390]$PROGEMITTER for
   [391]Program; [392]$LIBEMITTER for [393]Library; [394]$SHLIBEMITTER for
   [395]SharedLibrary and [396]$LDMODULEEMITTER for [397]LoadableModule;.
   Adding an emitter to one of these will cause it to be invoked in
   addition to any existing emitter for the corresponding builder.

   This example adds map creation as a linker flag, and modifies the
   standard [398]Program emitter to know that map generation is a
   side-effect:
env = Environment()
map_filename = "${TARGET.name}.map"

def map_emitter(target, source, env):
    target.append(map_filename)
    return target, source

env.Append(LINKFLAGS="-Wl,-Map={},--cref".format(map_filename))
env.Append(PROGEMITTER=map_emitter)
env.Program('hello.c')

   If you run this example, adding an option to tell SCons to dump some
   information about the dependencies it knows, it shows the map file
   option in use, and that SCons indeed knows about the map file, it's not
   just a silent side effect of the compiler:
% scons -Q --tree=prune
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello -Wl,-Map=hello.map,--cref hello.o
+-.
  +-SConstruct
  +-hello
  | +-hello.o
  |   +-hello.c
  +-hello.c
  +-hello.map
  | +-[hello.o]
  +-[hello.o]

17.8. Where To Put Your Custom Builders and Tools

   The site_scons directories give you a place to put Python modules and
   packages that you can import into your SConscript files (at the top
   level) add-on tools that can integrate into SCons (in a site_tools
   subdirectory), and a site_scons/site_init.py file that gets read before
   any SConstruct or SConscript file, allowing you to change SCons's
   default behavior.

   Each system type (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) searches a canonical set
   of directories for site_scons; see the man page for details. The
   top-level SConstruct's site_scons dir (that is, the one in the project)
   is always searched last, and its dir is placed first in the tool path
   so it overrides all others.

   If you get a tool from somewhere (the SCons wiki or a third party, for
   instance) and you'd like to use it in your project, a site_scons dir is
   the simplest place to put it. Tools come in two flavors; either a
   Python function that operates on an Environment or a Python module or
   package containing two functions, exists() and generate().

   A single-function Tool can just be included in your
   site_scons/site_init.py file where it will be parsed and made available
   for use. For instance, you could have a site_scons/site_init.py file
   like this:
def TOOL_ADD_HEADER(env):
    """A Tool to add a header from $HEADER to the source file"""
    add_header = Builder(
        action=['echo "$HEADER" > $TARGET', 'cat $SOURCE >> $TARGET']
    )
    env.Append(BUILDERS={'AddHeader': add_header})
    env['HEADER'] = ''  # set default value

   and a SConstruct like this:
# Use TOOL_ADD_HEADER from site_scons/site_init.py
env=Environment(tools=['default', TOOL_ADD_HEADER], HEADER="=====")
env.AddHeader('tgt', 'src')

   The TOOL_ADD_HEADER tool method will be called to add the AddHeader
   tool to the environment.

   A more full-fledged tool with exists() and generate() methods can be
   installed either as a module in the file
   site_scons/site_tools/toolname.py or as a package in the directory
   site_scons/site_tools/toolname. In the case of using a package, the
   exists() and generate() are in the file
   site_scons/site_tools/toolname/__init__.py. (In all the above case
   toolname is replaced by the name of the tool.) Since
   site_scons/site_tools is automatically added to the head of the tool
   search path, any tool found there will be available to all
   environments. Furthermore, a tool found there will override a built-in
   tool of the same name, so if you need to change the behavior of a
   built-in tool, site_scons gives you the hook you need.

   Many people have a collection of utility Python functions they'd like
   to include in their SConscript files: just put them in
   site_scons/my_utils.py or any valid Python module name of your choice.
   For instance you can do something like this in site_scons/my_utils.py
   to add build_id and MakeWorkDir functions:
from SCons.Script import *  # for Execute and Mkdir

def build_id():
    """Return a build ID (stub version)"""
    return "100"

def MakeWorkDir(workdir):
    """Create the specified dir immediately"""
    Execute(Mkdir(workdir))

   And then in your SConscript or any sub-SConscript anywhere in your
   build, you can import my_utils and use it:
import my_utils
print("build_id=" + my_utils.build_id())
my_utils.MakeWorkDir('/tmp/work')

   You can put this collection in its own module in a site_scons and
   import it as in the example, or you can include it in
   site_scons/site_init.py, which is automatically imported (unless you
   disable site directories). Note that in order to refer to objects in
   the SCons namespace such as Environment or Mkdir or Execute in any file
   other than a SConstruct or SConscript you always need to do
from SCons.Script import *

   This is true of modules in site_scons such as site_scons/site_init.py
   as well.

   You can use any of the user- or machine-wide site directories such as
   ~/.scons/site_scons instead of ./site_scons, or use the --site-dir
   option to point to your own directory. site_init.py and site_tools will
   be located under that directory. To avoid using a site_scons directory
   at all, even if it exists, use the --no-site-dir option.

Chapter 18. Not Writing a Builder: the Command Builder

   Creating a Builder and attaching it to a construction environment
   allows for a lot of flexibility when you want to re-use actions to
   build multiple files of the same type. This can, however, be cumbersome
   if you only need to execute one specific command to build a single file
   (or group of files). For these situations, SCons supports a
   [399]Command builder that arranges for a specific action to be executed
   to build a specific file or files. This looks a lot like the other
   builders (like [400]Program, [401]Object, etc.), but takes as an
   additional argument the command to be executed to build the file:
env = Environment()
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', "sed 's/x/y/' < $SOURCE > $TARGET")

   When executed, SCons runs the specified command, substituting
   [402]$SOURCE and [403]$TARGET as expected:
% scons -Q
sed 's/x/y/' < foo.in > foo.out

   This is often more convenient than creating a Builder object and adding
   it to the [404]$BUILDERS variable of a construction environment.

   Note that the action you specify to the Command Builder can be any
   legal SCons Action, such as a Python function:
env = Environment()

def build(target, source, env):
    # Whatever it takes to build
    return None

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', build)

   Which executes as follows:
% scons -Q
build(["foo.out"], ["foo.in"])

   Note that [405]$SOURCE and [406]$TARGET are expanded in the source and
   target as well, so you can write:
env.Command('${SOURCE.basename}.out', 'foo.in', build)

   which does the same thing as the previous example, but allows you to
   avoid repeating yourself.

   It may be helpful to use the action keyword to specify the action, is
   this makes things more clear to the reader:
env.Command('${SOURCE.basename}.out', 'foo.in', action=build)

   The method described in [407]Section 9.2, "Controlling How SCons Prints
   Build Commands: the $*COMSTR Variables" for controlling build output
   works well when used with pre-defined builders which have pre-defined
   *COMSTR variables for that purpose, but that is not the case when
   calling Command, where SCons has no specific knowledge of the action
   ahead of time. If the action argument to Command is not already an
   Action object, it will construct one for you with suitable defaults,
   which include a message based on the type of action. However, you can
   also construct the Action object yourself to pass to Command, which
   gives you much more control. Here's an evolution of the example from
   above showing this approach:
env = Environment()

def build(target, source, env):
    # Whatever it takes to build
    return None

act = Action(build, cmdstr="Building ${TARGET}")
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', action=act)

   Which executes as follows:
% scons -Q
Building foo.out

Chapter 19. Extending SCons: Pseudo-Builders and the AddMethod function

   The AddMethod function is used to add a method to an environment. It's
   typically used to add a "pseudo-builder," a function that looks like a
   Builder but wraps up calls to multiple other Builders or otherwise
   processes its arguments before calling one or more Builders. In the
   following example, we want to install the program into the standard
   /usr/bin directory hierarchy, but also copy it into a local install/bin
   directory from which a package might be built:
def install_in_bin_dirs(env, source):
    """Install source in both bin dirs"""
    i1 = env.Install("$BIN", source)
    i2 = env.Install("$LOCALBIN", source)
    return [i1[0], i2[0]] # Return a list, like a normal builder
env = Environment(BIN='/usr/bin', LOCALBIN='#install/bin')
env.AddMethod(install_in_bin_dirs, "InstallInBinDirs")
env.InstallInBinDirs(Program('hello.c')) # installs hello in both bin dirs

   This produces the following:
% scons -Q /
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"
Install file: "hello" as "install/bin/hello"

   As mentioned, a pseudo-builder also provides more flexibility in
   parsing arguments than you can get with a Builder. The next example
   shows a pseudo-builder with a named argument that modifies the
   filename, and a separate argument for the resource file (rather than
   having the builder figure it out by file extension). This example also
   demonstrates using the global AddMethod function to add a method to the
   global Environment class, so it will be used in all subsequently
   created environments.
def BuildTestProg(env, testfile, resourcefile, testdir="tests"):
    """Build the test program;
    prepends "test_" to src and target,
    and puts target into testdir."""
    srcfile = "test_%s.c" % testfile
    target = "%s/test_%s" % (testdir, testfile)
    if env['PLATFORM'] == 'win32':
        resfile = env.RES(resourcefile)
        p = env.Program(target, [srcfile, resfile])
    else:
        p = env.Program(target, srcfile)
    return p
AddMethod(Environment, BuildTestProg)

env = Environment()
env.BuildTestProg('stuff', resourcefile='res.rc')

   This produces the following on Linux:
% scons -Q
cc -o test_stuff.o -c test_stuff.c
cc -o tests/test_stuff test_stuff.o

   And the following on Windows:
C:\>scons -Q
rc /nologo /fores.res res.rc
cl /Fotest_stuff.obj /c test_stuff.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:tests\test_stuff.exe test_stuff.obj res.res
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

   Using AddMethod is better than just adding an instance method to a
   construction environment because it gets called as a proper method, and
   because AddMethod provides for copying the method to any clones of the
   construction environment instance.

Chapter 20. Extending SCons: Writing Your Own Scanners

   SCons has built-in scanners that know how to look in C/C++, Fortran, D,
   IDL, LaTeX, Python and SWIG source files for information about other
   files that targets built from those files depend on--for example, in
   the case of files that use the C preprocessor, the .h files that are
   specified using #include lines in the source. You can use the same
   mechanisms that SCons uses to create its built-in scanners to write
   scanners of your own for file types that SCons does not know how to
   scan "out of the box."

20.1. A Simple Scanner Example

   Suppose, for example, that we want to create a simple scanner for .foo
   files. A .foo file contains some text that will be processed, and can
   include other files on lines that begin with include followed by a file
   name:
include filename.foo

   Scanning a file will be handled by a Python function that you must
   supply. Here is a function that will use the Python re module to scan
   for the include lines in our example:
import re

include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    return env.File(include_re.findall(contents))

   It is important to note that you have to return a list of File nodes
   from the scanner function, simple strings for the file names won't do.
   As in the examples we are showing here, you can use the File function
   of your current construction environment in order to create nodes on
   the fly from a sequence of file names with relative paths.

   The scanner function must accept the four specified arguments and
   return a list of implicit dependencies. Presumably, these would be
   dependencies found from examining the contents of the file, although
   the function can perform any manipulation at all to generate the list
   of dependencies.

   node
          An SCons node object representing the file being scanned. The
          path name to the file can be used by converting the node to a
          string using the str() function, or an internal SCons
          get_text_contents() object method can be used to fetch the
          contents.

   env
          The construction environment in effect for this scan. The
          scanner function may choose to use construction variables from
          this environment to affect its behavior.

   path
          A list of directories that form the search path for included
          files for this scanner. This is how SCons handles the
          [408]$CPPPATH and [409]$LIBPATH variables.

   arg
          An optional argument that you can choose to have passed to this
          scanner function by various scanner instances.

   A Scanner object is created using the [410]Scanner function, which
   typically takes an skeys argument to associate a file suffix with this
   scanner. The Scanner object must then be associated with the
   [411]$SCANNERS construction variable in the current construction
   environment, typically by using the [412]Append method:
kscan = Scanner(function=kfile_scan, skeys=['.k'])
env.Append(SCANNERS=kscan)

   When we put it all together, it looks like:
import re

include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def kfile_scan(node, env, path):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    includes = include_re.findall(contents)
    return env.File(includes)

kscan = Scanner(function=kfile_scan, skeys=['.k'])

env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': '/usr/local/bin'})
env.Append(SCANNERS=kscan)

env.Command('foo', 'foo.k', 'kprocess < $SOURCES > $TARGET')

20.2. Adding a search path to a scanner: FindPathDirs

   If the build tool in question will use a path variable to search for
   included files or other dependencies, then the Scanner will need to
   take that path variable into account as well - [413]$CPPPATH and
   [414]$LIBPATH are used this way, for example. The path to search is
   passed to your scanner as the path argument. Path variables may be
   lists of nodes, semicolon-separated strings, or even contain
   construction variables which need to be expanded. SCons provides the
   [415]FindPathDirs function which returns a callable to expand a given
   path (given as a SCons construction variable name) to a list of paths
   at the time the scanner is called. Deferring evaluation until that
   point allows, for instance, the path to contain [416]$TARGET references
   which differ for each file scanned.

   Using FindPathDirs is quite easy. Continuing the above example, using
   KPATH as the construction variable with the search path (analogous to
   [417]$CPPPATH), we just modify the call to the Scanner factory function
   to include a path keyword arg:
kscan = Scanner(function=kfile_scan, skeys=['.k'], path_function=FindPathDirs('K
PATH'))

   FindPathDirs returns a callable object that, when called, will
   essentially expand the elements in env['KPATH'] and tell the scanner to
   search in those dirs. It will also properly add related repository and
   variant dirs to the search list. As a side note, the returned method
   stores the path in an efficient way so lookups are fast even when
   variable substitutions may be needed. This is important since many
   files get scanned in a typical build.

20.3. Using scanners with Builders

   One approach for introducing scanners into the build is in conjunction
   with a Builder. There are two relvant optional parameters we can use
   when creating a builder: source_scanner and target_scanner.
   source_scanner is used for scanning source files, and target_scanner is
   used for scanning the target once it is generated.
import re

include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    return env.File(include_re.findall(contents))

kscan = Scanner(function=kfile_scan, skeys=['.k'], path_function=FindPathDirs('K
PATH')

def build_function(target, source, env):
    # Code to build "target" from "source"
    return None

bld = Builder(
    action=build_function,
    suffix='.foo',
    source_scanner=kscan,
    src_suffix='.input',
)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file')

   An emitter function can modify the list of sources or targets passed to
   the action function when the builder is triggered.

   A scanner function will not affect the list of sources or targets seen
   by the builder during the build action. The scanner function will
   however affect if the builder should rebuild (if any of the files
   sourced by the scanner have changed for example).

Chapter 21. Multi-Platform Configuration (Autoconf Functionality)

   SCons has integrated support for build configuration similar in style
   to GNU Autoconf, but designed to be transparently multi-platform. The
   configuration system can help figure out if external build requirements
   such as system libraries or header files are available on the build
   system. This section describes how to use this SCons feature. (See also
   the SCons man page for additional information).

21.1. Configure Contexts

   The basic framework for multi-platform build configuration in SCons is
   to create a configure context inside a construction environment by
   calling the Configure function, perform the desired checks for
   libraries, functions, header files, etc., and then call the configure
   context's Finish method to finish off the configuration:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
# Checks for libraries, header files, etc. go here!
env = conf.Finish()

   The Finish call is required; if a new context is created while a
   context is active, even in a different construction environment, scons
   will complain and exit.

   SCons provides a number of pre-defined basic checks, as well as a
   mechanism for adding your own custom checks.

   There are a few possible strategies for failing configure checks. Some
   checks may be for features without which you cannot proceed. The simple
   approach here is just to exit SCons at that point - a number of the
   examples in this chapter are coded that way. If there are multiple hard
   requirements, however, it may be friendlier to the user to set a flag
   in case of any fails of hard requirements and accumulate a record of
   them, so that on the completion of the configure context they can all
   be listed prior to failing the build - as it can be frustrating to have
   to iterate through the setup, fixing one new requirement each
   iteration. Other checks may be for features which you can do without,
   and here the strategy will usually be to set a construction variable
   which the rest of the build can examine for its absence/presence, or to
   set particular compiler flags, library lists, etc. as appropriate for
   the circumstances, so you can proceed with the build appropriately
   based on available features.

   Note that SCons uses its own dependency mechanism to determine when a
   check needs to be run--that is, SCons does not run the checks every
   time it is invoked, but caches the values returned by previous checks
   and uses the cached values unless something has changed. This saves a
   tremendous amount of developer time while working on cross-platform
   build issues.

   The next sections describe the basic checks that SCons supports, as
   well as how to add your own custom checks.

21.2. Checking for the Existence of Header Files

   Testing the existence of a header file requires knowing what language
   the header file is. This information is supplied in the language
   keyword parameter to the CheckHeader method. Since scons grew up in a
   world of C/C++ code, a configure context also has a CheckCHeader method
   that specifically checks for the existence of a C header file:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckCHeader('math.h'):
    print('Math.h must be installed!')
    Exit(1)
if conf.CheckCHeader('foo.h'):
    conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES='HAS_FOO_H')
env = conf.Finish()

   As shown in the example, depending on the circumstances you can choose
   to terminate the build if a given header file doesn't exist, or you can
   modify the construction environment based on the presence or absence of
   a header file (the same applies to any other check). If there are a
   many elements to check for, it may be friendlier for the user if you do
   not terminate on the first failure, but track the problems found until
   the end and report on all of them, that way the user does not have to
   iterate multiple times, each time finding one new dependency that needs
   to be installed.

   If you need to check for the existence a C++ header file, use the
   CheckCXXHeader method:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckCXXHeader('vector.h'):
    print('vector.h must be installed!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

21.3. Checking for the Availability of a Function

   Check for the availability of a specific function using the CheckFunc
   method:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckFunc('strcpy'):
    print('Did not find strcpy(), using local version')
    conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES=('strcpy','my_local_strcpy'))
env = conf.Finish()

21.4. Checking for the Availability of a Library

   Check for the availability of a library using the CheckLib method. You
   only specify the base part of the library name, you don't need to add a
   lib prefix or a .a or .lib suffix:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckLib('m'):
    print('Did not find libm.a or m.lib, exiting!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

   Because the ability to use a library successfully often depends on
   having access to a header file that describes the library's interface,
   you can check for a library and a header file at the same time by using
   the CheckLibWithHeader method:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckLibWithHeader('m', 'math.h', language='c'):
    print('Did not find libm.a or m.lib, exiting!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

   This is essentially shorthand for separate calls to the CheckHeader and
   CheckLib functions.

21.5. Checking for the Availability of a typedef

   Check for the availability of a typedef by using the CheckType method:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckType('off_t'):
    print('Did not find off_t typedef, assuming int')
    conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES=('off_t','int'))
env = conf.Finish()

   You can also add a string that will be placed at the beginning of the
   test file that will be used to check for the typedef. This provide a
   way to specify files that must be included to find the typedef:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckType('off_t', '#include <sys/types.h>\n'):
    print('Did not find off_t typedef, assuming int')
    conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES=('off_t','int'))
env = conf.Finish()

21.6. Checking the size of a datatype

   Check the size of a datatype by using the CheckTypeSize method:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
int_size = conf.CheckTypeSize('unsigned int')
print('sizeof unsigned int is', int_size)
env = conf.Finish()

% scons -Q
sizeof unsigned int is 4
scons: `.' is up to date.

21.7. Checking for the Presence of a program

   Check for the presence of a program by using the CheckProg method:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckProg('foobar'):
  print('Unable to find the program foobar on the system')
  Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

21.8. Extending SCons: Adding Your Own Custom Checks

   A custom check is a Python function that checks for a certain condition
   to exist on the running system, usually using methods that SCons
   supplies to take care of the details of checking whether a compilation
   succeeds, a link succeeds, a program is runnable, etc. A simple custom
   check for the existence of a specific library might look as follows:
mylib_test_source_file = """
#include <mylib.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    MyLibrary mylib(argc, argv);
    return 0;
}
"""

def CheckMyLibrary(context):
    context.Message('Checking for MyLibrary...')
    result = context.TryLink(mylib_test_source_file, '.c')
    context.Result(result)
    return result

   The Message and Result methods should typically begin and end a custom
   check to let the user know what's going on: the Message call prints the
   specified message (with no trailing newline) and the Result call prints
   yes if the check succeeds and no if it doesn't. The TryLink method
   actually tests for whether the specified program text will successfully
   link.

   (Note that a custom check can modify its check based on any arguments
   you choose to pass it, or by using or modifying the configure context
   environment in the context.env attribute.)

   This custom check function is then attached to the configure context by
   passing a dictionary to the Configure call that maps a name of the
   check to the underlying function:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env, custom_tests={'CheckMyLibrary': CheckMyLibrary})

   You'll typically want to make the check and the function name the same,
   as we've done here, to avoid potential confusion.

   We can then put these pieces together and actually call the
   CheckMyLibrary check as follows:
mylib_test_source_file = """
#include <mylib.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    MyLibrary mylib(argc, argv);
    return 0;
}
"""

def CheckMyLibrary(context):
    context.Message('Checking for MyLibrary... ')
    result = context.TryLink(mylib_test_source_file, '.c')
    context.Result(result)
    return result

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env, custom_tests={'CheckMyLibrary': CheckMyLibrary})
if not conf.CheckMyLibrary():
    print('MyLibrary is not installed!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

# We would then add actual calls like Program() to build
# something using the "env" construction environment.

   If MyLibrary is not installed on the system, the output will look like:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript file ...
Checking for MyLibrary... no
MyLibrary is not installed!

   If MyLibrary is installed, the output will look like:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript file ...
Checking for MyLibrary... yes
scons: done reading SConscript
scons: Building targets ...
    .
    .
    .

21.9. Not Configuring When Cleaning Targets

   Using multi-platform configuration as described in the previous
   sections will run the configuration commands even when invoking scons
   -c to clean targets:
% scons -Q -c
Checking for MyLibrary... yes
Removed foo.o
Removed foo

   Although running the platform checks when removing targets doesn't hurt
   anything, it's usually unnecessary. You can avoid this by using the
   GetOption method to check whether the -c (clean) option has been
   invoked on the command line:
env = Environment()
if not env.GetOption('clean'):
    conf = Configure(env, custom_tests={'CheckMyLibrary': CheckMyLibrary})
    if not conf.CheckMyLibrary():
        print('MyLibrary is not installed!')
        Exit(1)
    env = conf.Finish()

% scons -Q -c
Removed foo.o
Removed foo

Chapter 22. Caching Built Files

   On multi-developer software projects, you can sometimes speed up every
   developer's builds a lot by allowing them to share a cache of the
   derived files that they build. After all, it is relatively rare that
   any in-progress change affects more than a few derived files, most will
   be unchanged. Using a cache can also help an individual developer: for
   example if you wish to start work on a new feature in a clean tree,
   those build artifacts which could be reused can be retrieved from the
   cache to populate the tree and save a lot of initial build time. SCons
   makes this easy and reliable.

22.1. Specifying the Derived-File Cache Directory

   To enable caching of derived files, use the [418]CacheDir function in
   any SConscript file:
CacheDir('/usr/local/build_cache')

   The cache directory you specify must have read and write access for all
   developers who will be accessing the cached files (if --cache-readonly
   is used, only read access is required). It should also be in some
   central location that all builds will be able to access. In
   environments where developers are using separate systems (like
   individual workstations) for builds, this directory would typically be
   on a shared or NFS-mounted file system. While SCons will create the
   specified cache directory as needed, in this multi user scenario it is
   usually best to create it ahead of time so the access rights can be set
   up correctly.

   Here's what happens: When a build has a CacheDir specified, every time
   a file is built, it is stored in that cache directory indexed by its
   build signature. On subsequent builds, before an action is invoked to
   build a file, the build signature is computed and SCons checks the
   derived-file cache directory to see if a file with the exact same build
   signature already exists. ^[[419]4] If so, the derived file will not be
   built locally, but will be copied into the local build directory from
   the derived-file cache directory, like this:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q
Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
Retrieved `hello' from cache

   Note that the CacheDir feature requires that the build signature be
   calculated, even if you configure SCons to use timestamps to decide if
   files are up to date (see the [420]Chapter 6, Dependencies chapter for
   information about the [421]Decider function), since the build signature
   is used to determine if a target file exists in the cache.
   Consequently, using CacheDir may reduce or negate any performance
   improvements from using timestamps for up-to-date decisions.

22.2. Keeping Build Output Consistent

   One potential drawback to using a derived-file cache is that the output
   printed by SCons can be inconsistent from invocation to invocation,
   because any given file may be rebuilt one time and retrieved from the
   derived-file cache the next time. This can make analyzing build output
   more difficult, especially for automated scripts that expect consistent
   output each time.

   If, however, you use the --cache-show option, SCons will print the
   command line that it would have executed to build the file, even when
   it is retrieving the file from the derived-file cache. This keeps the
   build output consistent across builds:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q --cache-show
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   The trade-off, of course, is that you no longer know whether or not
   SCons has retrieved a derived file from cache or has rebuilt it
   locally.

22.3. Not Using the Derived-File Cache for Specific Files

   You may want to disable caching for certain specific files in your
   configuration. For example, if you only want to put executable files in
   a central cache, but not the intermediate object files, you can use the
   [422]NoCache function to specify that the object files should not be
   cached:
env = Environment()
obj = env.Object('hello.c')
env.Program('hello.c')
CacheDir('cache')
NoCache('hello.o')

   Then when you run scons after cleaning the built targets, it will
   recompile the object file locally (since it doesn't exist in the
   derived-file cache directory), but still realize that the derived-file
   cache directory contains an up-to-date executable program that can be
   retrieved instead of re-linking:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
Retrieved `hello' from cache

22.4. Disabling the Derived-File Cache

   Retrieving an already-built file from the derived-file cache is usually
   a significant time-savings over rebuilding the file, but how much of a
   savings (or even whether it saves time at all) can depend a great deal
   on your system or network configuration. For example, retrieving cached
   files from a busy server over a busy network might end up being slower
   than rebuilding the files locally.

   In these cases, you can specify the --cache-disable command-line option
   to tell SCons to not retrieve already-built files from the derived-file
   cache directory:
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q
Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
Retrieved `hello' from cache
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q --cache-disable
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

22.5. Populating a Derived-File Cache With Already-Built Files

   Sometimes, you may have one or more derived files already built in your
   local build tree that you wish to make available to other people doing
   builds. For example, you may find it more effective to perform
   integration builds with the cache disabled (per the previous section)
   and only populate the derived-file cache directory with the built files
   after the integration build has completed successfully. This way, the
   cache will only get filled up with derived files that are part of a
   complete, successful build not with files that might be later
   overwritten while you debug integration problems.

   In this case, you can use the the --cache-force option to tell SCons to
   put all derived files in the cache, even if the files already exist in
   your local tree from having been built by a previous invocation:
% scons -Q --cache-disable
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q --cache-disable
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q --cache-force
scons: `.' is up to date.
% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.

   Notice how the above sample run demonstrates that the --cache-disable
   option avoids putting the built hello.o and hello files in the cache,
   but after using the --cache-force option, the files have been put in
   the cache for the next invocation to retrieve.

22.6. Minimizing Cache Contention: the --random Option

   If you allow multiple builds to update the derived-file cache directory
   simultaneously, two builds that occur at the same time can sometimes
   start "racing" with one another to build the same files in the same
   order. If, for example, you are linking multiple files into an
   executable program:
Program('prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c', 'f4.c', 'f5.c'])

   SCons will normally build the input object files on which the program
   depends in their normal, sorted order:
% scons -Q
cc -o f4.o -c f4.c
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f5.o -c f5.c
cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o f5.o

   But if two such builds take place simultaneously, they may each look in
   the cache at nearly the same time and both decide that f1.o must be
   rebuilt and pushed into the derived-file cache directory, then both
   decide that f2.o must be rebuilt (and pushed into the derived-file
   cache directory), then both decide that f3.o must be rebuilt... This
   won't cause any actual build problems--both builds will succeed,
   generate correct output files, and populate the cache--but it does
   represent wasted effort.

   To alleviate such contention for the cache, you can use the --random
   command-line option to tell SCons to build dependencies in a random
   order:
  % scons -Q --random
  cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
  cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
  cc -o f5.o -c f5.c
  cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
  cc -o f4.o -c f4.c
  cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o f5.o

   Multiple builds using the --random option will usually build their
   dependencies in different, random orders, which minimizes the chances
   for a lot of contention for same-named files in the derived-file cache
   directory. Multiple simultaneous builds might still race to try to
   build the same target file on occasion, but long sequences of
   inefficient contention should be rare.

   Note, of course, the --random option will cause the output that SCons
   prints to be inconsistent from invocation to invocation, which may be
   an issue when trying to compare output from different build runs.

   If you want to make sure dependencies will be built in a random order
   without having to specify the --random on very command line, you can
   use the [423]SetOption function to set the random option within any
   SConscript file:
SetOption('random', 1)
Program('prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c', 'f4.c', 'f5.c'])

22.7. Using a Custom CacheDir Class

   SCons' internal CacheDir class can be extended to support customization
   around the details of caching behaviors, for example using compressed
   cache files, encrypted cache files, gathering statistics and data, or
   many other aspects.

   To create your own custom cache class, your custom class must be a
   subclass of the SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir class. You can then pass your
   custom class to the [424]CacheDir method or set the construction
   variable [425]$CACHEDIR_CLASS to the class before configuring the cache
   in that environment. SCons will internally invoke and use your custom
   class when performing cache operations. The below example shows a
   simple use case of overriding the copy_from_cache method to record the
   total number of bytes pulled from the cache.
import SCons

   ^[[426]4] A few inside details: SCons tracks two main kinds of
   cryptographic hashes: a content signature, which is a hash of the
   contents of a file participating in the build (depepdencies as well as
   targets); and a build signature, which is a hash of the elements needed
   to build a target, such as the command line, the contents of the
   sources, and possibly information about tools used in the build. The
   hash function produces a unique signature from its inputs, no other set
   of inputs can produce that same signature. The build signature from
   building a target is used as the filename of the target file in the
   derived-file cache - that way lookups are efficient, just compute a
   build signature and see if a file exists with that as the name.

   The use of the build signature provides protection from concflicts: if
   two developers have different setups, so they would produce built
   objects that are not identical, then because the difference in tools
   will show up in the build signature, which is used as the name of the
   cache entry, they will end up being stored as separate entries.

Chapter 23. Alias Targets

   We've already seen how you can use the Alias function to create a
   target named install:
env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

   You can then use this alias on the command line to tell SCons more
   naturally that you want to install files:
% scons -Q install
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

   Like other Builder methods, though, the Alias method returns an object
   representing the alias being built. You can then use this object as
   input to anothother Builder. This is especially useful if you use such
   an object as input to another call to the Alias Builder, allowing you
   to create a hierarchy of nested aliases:
env = Environment()
p = env.Program('foo.c')
l = env.Library('bar.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', p)
env.Install('/usr/lib', l)
ib = env.Alias('install-bin', '/usr/bin')
il = env.Alias('install-lib', '/usr/lib')
env.Alias('install', [ib, il])

   This example defines separate install, install-bin, and install-lib
   aliases, allowing you finer control over what gets installed:
% scons -Q install-bin
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o
Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
% scons -Q install-lib
cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
ar rc libbar.a bar.o
ranlib libbar.a
Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"
% scons -Q -c /
Removed foo.o
Removed foo
Removed /usr/bin/foo
Removed bar.o
Removed libbar.a
Removed /usr/lib/libbar.a
% scons -Q install
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o
Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
ar rc libbar.a bar.o
ranlib libbar.a
Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"

Chapter 24. Java Builds

   So far, we've been using examples of building C and C++ programs to
   demonstrate the features of SCons. SCons also supports building Java
   programs, but Java builds are handled slightly differently, which
   reflects the ways in which the Java compiler and tools build programs
   differently than other languages' tool chains.

24.1. Building Java Class Files: the Java Builder

   The basic activity when programming in Java, of course, is to take one
   or more .java files containing Java source code and to call the Java
   compiler to turn them into one or more .class files. In SCons, you do
   this by giving the [427]Java Builder a target directory in which to put
   the .class files, and a source directory that contains the .java files:
Java('classes', 'src')

   If the src directory contains three .java source files, then running
   SCons might look like this:
% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/Example
3.java

   SCons will actually search the src directory tree for all of the .java
   files. The Java compiler will then create the necessary class files in
   the classes subdirectory, based on the class names found in the .java
   files.

24.2. How SCons Handles Java Dependencies

   In addition to searching the source directory for .java files, SCons
   actually runs the .java files through a stripped-down Java parser that
   figures out what classes are defined. In other words, SCons knows,
   without you having to tell it, what .class files will be produced by
   the javac call. So our one-liner example from the preceding section:
Java('classes', 'src')

   Will not only tell you reliably that the .class files in the classes
   subdirectory are up-to-date:
% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/Example
3.java
% scons -Q classes
scons: `classes' is up to date.

   But it will also remove all of the generated .class files, even for
   inner classes, without you having to specify them manually. For
   example, if our Example1.java and Example3.java files both define
   additional classes, and the class defined in Example2.java has an inner
   class, running scons -c will clean up all of those .class files as
   well:
% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/Example
3.java
% scons -Q -c classes
Removed classes/Example1.class
Removed classes/AdditionalClass1.class
Removed classes/Example2$Inner2.class
Removed classes/Example2.class
Removed classes/Example3.class
Removed classes/AdditionalClass3.class

   To ensure correct handling of .class dependencies in all cases, you
   need to tell SCons which Java version is being used. This is needed
   because Java 1.5 changed the .class file names for nested anonymous
   inner classes. Use the JAVAVERSION construction variable to specify the
   version in use. With Java 1.6, the one-liner example can then be
   defined like this:
Java('classes', 'src', JAVAVERSION='1.6')

   See JAVAVERSION in the man page for more information.

24.3. Building Java Archive (.jar) Files: the Jar Builder

   After building the class files, it's common to collect them into a Java
   archive (.jar) file, which you do by calling the [428]Jar Builder. If
   you want to just collect all of the class files within a subdirectory,
   you can just specify that subdirectory as the Jar source:
Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
Jar(target = 'test.jar', source = 'classes')

   SCons will then pass that directory to the jar command, which will
   collect all of the underlying .class files:
% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/Example
3.java
jar cf test.jar classes

   If you want to keep all of the .class files for multiple programs in
   one location, and only archive some of them in each .jar file, you can
   pass the Jar builder a list of files as its source. It's extremely
   simple to create multiple .jar files this way, using the lists of
   target class files created by calls to the [429]Java builder as sources
   to the various Jar calls:
prog1_class_files = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'prog1')
prog2_class_files = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'prog2')
Jar(target = 'prog1.jar', source = prog1_class_files)
Jar(target = 'prog2.jar', source = prog2_class_files)

   This will then create prog1.jar and prog2.jar next to the
   subdirectories that contain their .java files:
% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath prog1 prog1/Example1.java prog1/Example2.java
javac -d classes -sourcepath prog2 prog2/Example3.java prog2/Example4.java
jar cf prog1.jar -C classes Example1.class -C classes Example2.class
jar cf prog2.jar -C classes Example3.class -C classes Example4.class

24.4. Building C Header and Stub Files: the JavaH Builder

   You can generate C header and source files for implementing native
   methods, by using the [430]JavaH Builder. There are several ways of
   using the JavaH Builder. One typical invocation might look like:
classes = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src/pkg/sub')
JavaH(target = 'native', source = classes)

   The source is a list of class files generated by the call to the
   [431]Java Builder, and the target is the output directory in which we
   want the C header files placed. The target gets converted into the -d
   when SCons runs javah:
% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg/sub/E
xample2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
javah -d native -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg.sub.Exa
mple3

   In this case, the call to javah will generate the header files
   native/pkg_sub_Example1.h, native/pkg_sub_Example2.h and
   native/pkg_sub_Example3.h. Notice that SCons remembered that the class
   files were generated with a target directory of classes, and that it
   then specified that target directory as the -classpath option to the
   call to javah.

   Although it's more convenient to use the list of class files returned
   by the [432]Java Builder as the source of a call to the [433]JavaH
   Builder, you can specify the list of class files by hand, if you
   prefer. If you do, you need to set the [434]$JAVACLASSDIR construction
   variable when calling JavaH:
Java(target='classes', source='src/pkg/sub')
class_file_list = [
    'classes/pkg/sub/Example1.class',
    'classes/pkg/sub/Example2.class',
    'classes/pkg/sub/Example3.class',
]
JavaH(target='native', source=class_file_list, JAVACLASSDIR='classes')

   The $JAVACLASSDIR value then gets converted into the -classpath when
   SCons runs javah:
% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg/sub/E
xample2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
javah -d native -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg.sub.Exa
mple3

   Lastly, if you don't want a separate header file generated for each
   source file, you can specify an explicit File Node as the target of the
   JavaH Builder:
classes = Java(target='classes', source='src/pkg/sub')
JavaH(target=File('native.h'), source=classes)

   Because SCons assumes by default that the target of the [435]JavaH
   builder is a directory, you need to use the File function to make sure
   that SCons doesn't create a directory named native.h. When a file is
   used, though, SCons correctly converts the file name into the javah -o
   option:
% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg/sub/E
xample2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
javah -o native.h -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg.sub.E
xample3

   Note that the the javah command was removed from the JDK as of JDK 10,
   and the approved method (available since JDK 8) is to use javac to
   generate native headers at the same time as the Java source code is
   compiled.. As such the [436]JavaH builder is of limited utility in
   later Java versions.

24.5. Building RMI Stub and Skeleton Class Files: the RMIC Builder

   You can generate Remote Method Invocation stubs by using the [437]RMIC
   Builder. The source is a list of directories, typically returned by a
   call to the [438]Java Builder, and the target is an output directory
   where the _Stub.class and _Skel.class files will be placed:
classes = Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src/pkg/sub')
RMIC(target = 'outdir', source = classes)

   As it did with the [439]JavaH Builder, SCons remembers the class
   directory and passes it as the -classpath option to rmic:
% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg/sub/E
xample2.java
rmic -d outdir -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2

   This example would generate the files
   outdir/pkg/sub/Example1_Skel.class, outdir/pkg/sub/Example1_Stub.class,
   outdir/pkg/sub/Example2_Skel.class and
   outdir/pkg/sub/Example2_Stub.class.

Chapter 25. Internationalization and localization with gettext

   The [440]gettext toolset supports internationalization and localization
   of SCons-based projects. Builders provided by [441]gettext automatize
   generation and updates of translation files. You can manage
   translations and translation templates similarly to how it's done with
   autotools.

25.1. Prerequisites

   To follow examples provided in this chapter set up your operating
   system to support two or more languages. In following examples we use
   locales en_US, de_DE, and pl_PL.

   Ensure, that you have [442]GNU gettext utilities installed on your
   system.

   To edit translation files you may wish to install [443]poedit editor.

25.2. Simple project

   Let's start with a very simple project, the "Hello world" program for
   example
/* hello.c */
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  printf("Hello world\n");
  return 0;
}

   Prepare a SConstruct to compile the program as usual.
# SConstruct
env = Environment()
hello = Program(["hello.c"])

   Now we'll convert the project to a multi-lingual one. If you don't
   already have [444]GNU gettext utilities installed, install them from
   your preffered package repository, or download from
   [445]http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/. For the purpose of this example,
   you should have following three locales installed on your system:
   en_US, de_DE and pl_PL. On debian, for example, you may enable certain
   locales through dpkg-reconfigure locales.

   First prepare the hello.c program for internationalization. Change the
   previous code so it reads as follows:
/* hello.c */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <libintl.h>
#include <locale.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  bindtextdomain("hello", "locale");
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
  textdomain("hello");
  printf(gettext("Hello world\n"));
  return 0;
}

   Detailed recipes for such conversion can be found at
   [446]http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Sources.
   The gettext("...") has two purposes. First, it marks messages for the
   xgettext(1) program, which we will use to extract from the sources the
   messages for localization. Second, it calls the gettext library
   internals to translate the message at runtime.

   Now we shall instruct SCons how to generate and maintain translation
   files. For that, use the [447]Translate builder and [448]MOFiles
   builder. The first one takes source files, extracts internationalized
   messages from them, creates so-called POT file (translation template),
   and then creates PO translation files, one for each requested language.
   Later, during the development lifecycle, the builder keeps all these
   files up-to date. The [449]MOFiles builder compiles the PO files to
   binary form. Then install the MO files under directory called locale.

   The completed SConstruct is as follows:
# SConstruct
env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'gettext'] )
hello = env.Program(["hello.c"])
env['XGETTEXTFLAGS'] = [
  '--package-name=%s' % 'hello',
  '--package-version=%s' % '1.0',
]
po = env.Translate(["pl","en", "de"], ["hello.c"], POAUTOINIT = 1)
mo = env.MOFiles(po)
InstallAs(["locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"], ["en.mo"])
InstallAs(["locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"], ["pl.mo"])
InstallAs(["locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"], ["de.mo"])

   Generate the translation files with scons po-update. You should see the
   output from SCons simillar to this:
user@host:$ scons po-update
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
Entering '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
xgettext --package-name=hello --package-version=1.0 -o - hello.c
Leaving '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
Writting 'messages.pot' (new file)
msginit --no-translator -l pl -i messages.pot -o pl.po
Created pl.po.
msginit --no-translator -l en -i messages.pot -o en.po
Created en.po.
msginit --no-translator -l de -i messages.pot -o de.po
Created de.po.
scons: done building targets.

   If everything is right, you should see following new files.
user@host:$ ls *.po*
de.po  en.po  messages.pot  pl.po

   Open en.po in poedit and provide the English translation to message
   "Hello world\n". Do the same for de.po (deutsch) and pl.po (polish).
   Let the translations be, for example:
     * en: "Welcome to beautiful world!\n"
     * de: "Hallo Welt!\n"
     * pl: "Witaj swiecie!\n"

   Now compile the project by executing scons. The output should be
   similar to this:
user@host:$ scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
msgfmt -c -o de.mo de.po
msgfmt -c -o en.mo en.po
gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c
gcc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "de.mo" as "locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
Install file: "en.mo" as "locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
msgfmt -c -o pl.mo pl.po
Install file: "pl.mo" as "locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
scons: done building targets.

   SCons automatically compiled the PO files to binary format MO, and the
   InstallAs lines installed these files under locale folder.

   Your program should be now ready. You may try it as follows (linux):
user@host:$ LANG=en_US.UTF-8 ./hello
Welcome to beautiful world

user@host:$ LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 ./hello
Hallo Welt

user@host:$ LANG=pl_PL.UTF-8 ./hello
Witaj swiecie

   To demonstrate the further life of translation files, let's change
   Polish translation (poedit pl.po) to "Witaj drogi swiecie\n". Run scons
   to see how scons reacts to this
user@host:$scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
msgfmt -c -o pl.mo pl.po
Install file: "pl.mo" as "locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
scons: done building targets.

   Now, open hello.c and add another one printf line with new message.
/* hello.c */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <libintl.h>
#include <locale.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  bindtextdomain("hello", "locale");
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
  textdomain("hello");
  printf(gettext("Hello world\n"));
  printf(gettext("and good bye\n"));
  return 0;
}

   Compile project with scons. This time, the msgmerge(1) program is used
   by SCons to update PO file. The output from compilation is like:
user@host:$scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
Entering '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
xgettext --package-name=hello --package-version=1.0 -o - hello.c
Leaving '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
Writting 'messages.pot' (messages in file were outdated)
msgmerge --update de.po messages.pot
... done.
msgfmt -c -o de.mo de.po
msgmerge --update en.po messages.pot
... done.
msgfmt -c -o en.mo en.po
gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c
gcc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "de.mo" as "locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
Install file: "en.mo" as "locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
msgmerge --update pl.po messages.pot
... done.
msgfmt -c -o pl.mo pl.po
Install file: "pl.mo" as "locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
scons: done building targets.

   The next example demonstrates what happens if we change the source code
   in such way that the internationalized messages do not change. The
   answer is that none of translation files (POT, PO) are touched (i.e. no
   content changes, no creation/modification time changed and so on).
   Let's append another line to the program (after the last printf), so
   its code becomes:
/* hello.c */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <libintl.h>
#include <locale.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  bindtextdomain("hello", "locale");
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
  textdomain("hello");
  printf(gettext("Hello world\n"));
  printf(gettext("and good bye\n"));
  printf("----------------\n");
  return a;
}

   Compile the project. You'll see on your screen
user@host:$scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
Entering '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
xgettext --package-name=hello --package-version=1.0 -o - hello.c
Leaving '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
Not writting 'messages.pot' (messages in file found to be up-to-date)
gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c
gcc -o hello hello.o
scons: done building targets.

   As you see, the internationalized messages ditn't change, so the POT
   and the rest of translation files have not even been touched.

Chapter 26. Miscellaneous Functionality

   SCons supports a lot of additional functionality that doesn't readily
   fit into the other chapters.

26.1. Verifying the Python Version: the EnsurePythonVersion Function

   Although the SCons code itself will run on any 2.x Python version 2.7
   or later, you are perfectly free to make use of Python syntax and
   modules from later versions when writing your SConscript files or your
   own local modules. If you do this, it's usually helpful to configure
   SCons to exit gracefully with an error message if it's being run with a
   version of Python that simply won't work with your code. This is
   especially true if you're going to use SCons to build source code that
   you plan to distribute publicly, where you can't be sure of the Python
   version that an anonymous remote user might use to try to build your
   software.

   SCons provides an EnsurePythonVersion function for this. You simply
   pass it the major and minor versions numbers of the version of Python
   you require:
EnsurePythonVersion(2, 5)

   And then SCons will exit with the following error message when a user
   runs it with an unsupported earlier version of Python:
% scons -Q
Python 2.5 or greater required, but you have Python 2.3.6

26.2. Verifying the SCons Version: the EnsureSConsVersion Function

   You may, of course, write your SConscript files to use features that
   were only added in recent versions of SCons. When you publicly
   distribute software that is built using SCons, it's helpful to have
   SCons verify the version being used and exit gracefully with an error
   message if the user's version of SCons won't work with your SConscript
   files. SCons provides an EnsureSConsVersion function that verifies the
   version of SCons in the same the EnsurePythonVersion function verifies
   the version of Python, by passing in the major and minor versions
   numbers of the version of SCons you require:
EnsureSConsVersion(1, 0)

   And then SCons will exit with the following error message when a user
   runs it with an unsupported earlier version of SCons:
% scons -Q
SCons 1.0 or greater required, but you have SCons 0.98.5

26.3. Explicitly Terminating SCons While Reading SConscript Files: the Exit
Function

   SCons supports an Exit function which can be used to terminate SCons
   while reading the SConscript files, usually because you've detected a
   condition under which it doesn't make sense to proceed:
if ARGUMENTS.get('FUTURE'):
    print("The FUTURE option is not supported yet!")
    Exit(2)
env = Environment()
env.Program('hello.c')

% scons -Q FUTURE=1
The FUTURE option is not supported yet!
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   The Exit function takes as an argument the (numeric) exit status that
   you want SCons to exit with. If you don't specify a value, the default
   is to exit with 0, which indicates successful execution.

   Note that the Exit function is equivalent to calling the Python
   sys.exit function (which the it actually calls), but because Exit is a
   SCons function, you don't have to import the Python sys module to use
   it.

26.4. Searching for Files: the FindFile Function

   The FindFile function searches for a file in a list of directories. If
   there is only one directory, it can be given as a simple string. The
   function returns a File node if a matching file exists, or None if no
   file is found. (See the documentation for the Glob function for an
   alternative way of searching for entries in a directory.)
# one directory
print("%s"%FindFile('missing', '.'))
t = FindFile('exists', '.')
print("%s %s"%(t.__class__, t))

% scons -Q
None
<class 'SCons.Node.FS.File'> exists
scons: `.' is up to date.

# several directories
includes = [ '.', 'include', 'src/include']
headers = [ 'nonesuch.h', 'config.h', 'private.h', 'dist.h']
for hdr in headers:
    print('%-12s: %s'%(hdr, FindFile(hdr, includes)))

% scons -Q
nonesuch.h  : None
config.h    : config.h
private.h   : src/include/private.h
dist.h      : include/dist.h
scons: `.' is up to date.

   If the file exists in more than one directory, only the first
   occurrence is returned.
print(FindFile('multiple', ['sub1', 'sub2', 'sub3']))
print(FindFile('multiple', ['sub2', 'sub3', 'sub1']))
print(FindFile('multiple', ['sub3', 'sub1', 'sub2']))

% scons -Q
sub1/multiple
sub2/multiple
sub3/multiple
scons: `.' is up to date.

   In addition to existing files, FindFile will also find derived files
   (that is, non-leaf files) that haven't been built yet. (Leaf files
   should already exist, or the build will fail!)
# Neither file exists, so build will fail
Command('derived', 'leaf', 'cat >$TARGET $SOURCE')
print(FindFile('leaf', '.'))
print(FindFile('derived', '.'))

% scons -Q
leaf
derived
cat > derived leaf

# Only 'leaf' exists
Command('derived', 'leaf', 'cat >$TARGET $SOURCE')
print(FindFile('leaf', '.'))
print(FindFile('derived', '.'))

% scons -Q
leaf
derived
cat > derived leaf

   If a source file exists, FindFile will correctly return the name in the
   build directory.
# Only 'src/leaf' exists
VariantDir('build', 'src')
print(FindFile('leaf', 'build'))

% scons -Q
build/leaf
scons: `.' is up to date.

26.5. Handling Nested Lists: the Flatten Function

   SCons supports a Flatten function which takes an input Python sequence
   (list or tuple) and returns a flattened list containing just the
   individual elements of the sequence. This can be handy when trying to
   examine a list composed of the lists returned by calls to various
   Builders. For example, you might collect object files built in
   different ways into one call to the Program Builder by just enclosing
   them in a list, as follows:
objects = [
    Object('prog1.c'),
    Object('prog2.c', CCFLAGS='-DFOO'),
]
Program(objects)

   Because the Builder calls in SCons flatten their input lists, this
   works just fine to build the program:
% scons -Q
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog2.o -c -DFOO prog2.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o prog2.o

   But if you were debugging your build and wanted to print the absolute
   path of each object file in the objects list, you might try the
   following simple approach, trying to print each Node's abspath
   attribute:
objects = [
    Object('prog1.c'),
    Object('prog2.c', CCFLAGS='-DFOO'),
]
Program(objects)

for object_file in objects:
    print(object_file.abspath)

   This does not work as expected because each call to str is operating an
   embedded list returned by each Object call, not on the underlying Nodes
   within those lists:
% scons -Q
AttributeError: 'NodeList' object has no attribute 'abspath':
  File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 8:
    print(object_file.abspath)

   The solution is to use the Flatten function so that you can pass each
   Node to the str separately:
objects = [
    Object('prog1.c'),
    Object('prog2.c', CCFLAGS='-DFOO'),
]
Program(objects)

for object_file in Flatten(objects):
    print(object_file.abspath)

% scons -Q
/home/me/project/prog1.o
/home/me/project/prog2.o
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog2.o -c -DFOO prog2.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o prog2.o

26.6. Finding the Invocation Directory: the GetLaunchDir Function

   If you need to find the directory from which the user invoked the scons
   command, you can use the GetLaunchDir function:
env = Environment(
    LAUNCHDIR = GetLaunchDir(),
)
env.Command('directory_build_info',
            '$LAUNCHDIR/build_info'
            Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'))

   Because SCons is usually invoked from the top-level directory in which
   the SConstruct file lives, the Python os.getcwd() is often equivalent.
   However, the SCons -u, -U and -D command-line options, when invoked
   from a subdirectory, will cause SCons to change to the directory in
   which the SConstruct file is found. When those options are used,
   GetLaunchDir will still return the path to the user's invoking
   subdirectory, allowing the SConscript configuration to still get at
   configuration (or other) files from the originating directory.

26.7. Declaring Additional Outputs: the SideEffect Function

   Sometimes the way an action is defined causes effects on files that
   SCons does not recognize as targets. The [450]SideEffect method can be
   used to informs SCons about such files. This can be used just to flag a
   dependency for use in subsequent build steps, although there is usually
   a better way to do that. The primary use for the SideEffect method is
   to prevent two build steps from simultaneously modifying or accessing
   the same file in a way that could impact each other.

   In this example, the rule to build file1 will also put data into log,
   which is used as a source for the command to generate file2, but log is
   unknown to SCons on a clean build: it neither exists, nor is it a
   target output by any builder. The SConscript uses SideEffect to inform
   SCons about the additional output file.
env = Environment()
f2 = env.Command(
    target='file2',
    source='log',
    action=Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE')
)
f1 = env.Command(
    target='file1',
    source=[],
    action='echo >$TARGET data1; echo >log updated file1'
)
env.SideEffect('log', f1)

   Without the SideEffect, this build would fail with a message Source
   `log' not found, needed by target `file2', but now it can proceed:
% scons -Q
echo > file1 data1; echo >log updated file1
Copy("file2", "log")

   However, it is better to actually identify log as a target, since in
   this case that's what it is:
env = Environment()
f2 = env.Command(
    target='file2',
    source='log',
    action=Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE')
)
f1 = env.Command(
    target=['file1', 'log'],
    source=[],
    action='echo >$TARGET data1; echo >log updated file1'
)

% scons -Q
echo > file1 data1; echo >log updated file1
Copy("file2", "log")

   In general, SideEffect is not intended for the case when a command
   produces extra target files (that is, files which will be used as
   sources to other build steps). For example, the the Microsoft Visual
   C/C++ compiler is capable of performing incremental linking, for which
   it uses a status file - such that linking foo.exe also produces a
   foo.ilk, or uses it if it was already present, if the /INCREMENTAL
   option was supplied. Specifying foo.ilk as a side-effect of foo.exe is
   not a recommended use of SideEffect since foo.ilk is used by the link.
   SCons handles side-effect files slightly differently in its analysis of
   the dependency graph. When a command produces multiple output files,
   they should be specified as multiple targets of the call to the
   relevant builder function. The SideEffect function itself should really
   only be used when it's important to ensure that commands are not
   executed in parallel, such as when a "peripheral" file (such as a log
   file) may actually be updated by more than one command invocation.

   Unfortunately, the tool which sets up the Program builder for the MSVC
   compiler chain does not come prebuilt with an understanding of the
   details of the .ilk example - that the target list would need to change
   in the presence of that specific option flag. Unlike the trivial
   example above where we could simply tell the Command builder there were
   two targets of the action, modifying the chain of events for a builder
   like Program, though not inherently complex, is definitely an advanced
   SCons topic. It's okay to use SideEffect here to get started, as long
   as it comes with an understanding that it's "not quite right". Perhaps
   leave a comment in the file as a reminder, if it does turn out to cause
   problems later.

   So if the main use is to prevent parallelism problems, here is an
   example to illustrate. Say a program that you need to call to build a
   target file will also update a log file describing what the program
   does while building the target. The following configuration would have
   SCons invoke a hypothetical script named build (in the local directory)
   with command-line arguments telling it to write log information to a
   common logfile.txt file:
env = Environment()
env.Command(
    target='file1.out',
    source='file1.in',
    action='./build --log logfile.txt $SOURCE $TARGET'
)
env.Command(
    target='file2.out',
    source='file2.in',
    action='./build --log logfile.txt $SOURCE $TARGET'
)

   This can cause problems when running the build in parallel if SCons
   decides to update both targets by running both program invocations at
   the same time. The multiple program invocations may interfere with each
   other writing to the common log file, leading at best to intermixed
   output in the log file, and at worst to an actual failed build (on a
   system like Windows, for example, where only one process at a time can
   open the log file for writing).

   We can make sure that SCons does not run these build commands at the
   same time by using the SideEffect function to specify that updating the
   logfile.txt file is a side effect of building the specified file1 and
   file2 target files:
env = Environment()
f1 = env.Command(
    target='file1.out',
    source='file1.in',
    action='./build --log logfile.txt $SOURCE $TARGET'
)
f2 = env.Command(
    target='file2.out',
    source='file2.in',
    action='./build --log logfile.txt $SOURCE $TARGET'
)
env.SideEffect('logfile.txt', f1 + f2)

   This makes sure the the two ./build steps are run sequentially, even
   with the --jobs=2 in the command line:
% scons -Q --jobs=2
./build --log logfile.txt file1.in file1.out
./build --log logfile.txt file2.in file2.out

   The SideEffect function can be called multiple times for the same
   side-effect file. In fact, the name used as a SideEffect does not even
   need to actually exist as a file on disk - SCons will still make sure
   that the relevant targets will be executed sequentially, not in
   parallel. The side effect is actually a pseudo-target, and SCons mainly
   cares whether nodes are listed as depending on it, not about its
   contents.
env = Environment()
f1 = env.Command('file1.out', [], action='echo >$TARGET data1')
env.SideEffect('not_really_updated', f1)
f2 = env.Command('file2.out', [], action='echo >$TARGET data2')
env.SideEffect('not_really_updated', f2)

% scons -Q --jobs=2
echo > file1.out data1
echo > file2.out data2

26.8. Virtual environments (virtualenvs)

   Virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. A python
   application (such as SCons) may be executed within an activated
   virtualenv. The activation of virtualenv modifies current environment
   by defining some virtualenv-specific variables and modifying search
   PATH, such that executables installed within virtualenv's home
   directory are preferred over the ones installed outside of it.

   Normally, SCons uses hard-coded PATH when searching for external
   executables, so it always picks-up executables from these pre-defined
   locations. This applies also to python interpreter, which is invoked by
   some custom SCons tools or test suites. This means, when running SCons
   in a virtualenv, an eventual invocation of python interpreter from
   SCons script will most probably jump out of virtualenv and execute
   python executable found in hard-coded SCons PATH, not the one which is
   executing SCons. Some users may consider this as an inconsistency.

   This issue may be overcome by using the --enable-virtualenv option. The
   option automatically imports virtualenv-related environment variables
   to all created construction environment env['ENV'], and modifies SCons
   PATH appropriately to prefer virtualenv's executables. Setting
   environment variable SCONS_ENABLE_VIRTUALENV=1 will have same effect.
   If virtualenv support is enabled system-vide by the environment
   variable, it may be suppressed with the --ignore-virtualenv option.

   Inside of SConscript, a global function Virtualenv is available. It
   returns a path to virtualenv's home directory, or None if scons is not
   running from virtualenv. Note that this function returns a path even if
   scons is run from an unactivated virtualenv.

Chapter 27. Using SCons with other build tools

   Sometimes a project needs to interact with other projects in various
   ways. For example, many open source projects make use of components
   from other open source projects, and want to use those in their
   released form, not recode their builds into SCons. As another example,
   sometimes the flexibility and power of SCons is useful for managing the
   overall project, but developers might like faster incremental builds
   when making small changes by using a different tool.

   This chapter shows some techniques for interacting with other projects
   and tools effectively from within SCons.

27.1. Creating a Compilation Database

   Tooling to perform analysis and modification of source code often needs
   to know not only the source code itself, but also how it will be
   compiled, as the compilation line affects the behavior of macros,
   includes, etc. SCons has a record of this information once it has run,
   in the form of Actions associated with the sources, and can emit this
   information so tools can use it.

   The Clang project has defined a JSON Compilation Database. This
   database is in common use as input into Clang tools and many IDEs and
   editors as well. See [451]JSON Compilation Database Format
   Specification for complete information. SCons can emit a compilation
   database in this format by enabling the [452]compilation_db tool and
   calling the [453]CompilationDatabase builder (available since scons
   4.0).

   The compilation database can be populated with source and output files
   either with paths relative to the top of the build, or using absolute
   paths. This is controlled by COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH=(True|False)
   which defaults to False. The entries in this file can be filtered by
   using COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER='pattern' where the filter pattern is a
   string following the Python [454]fnmatch syntax. This filtering can be
   used for outputting different build variants to different compilation
   database files.

   The following example illustrates generating a compilation database
   containing absolute paths:
env = Environment(COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH=True)
env.Tool('compilation_db')
env.CompilationDatabase()
env.Program('hello.c')

% scons -Q
Building compilation database compile_commands.json
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

   compile_commands.json contains:
[
    {
        "command": "gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c",
        "directory": "/home/user/sandbox",
        "file": "/home/user/sandbox/hello.c",
        "output": "/home/user/sandbox/hello.o"
    }
]

   Notice that the generated database contains only an entry for the
   hello.c/hello.o pairing, and nothing for the generation of the final
   executable hello - the transformation of hello.o to hello does not have
   any information that affects interpretation of the source code, so it
   is not interesting to the compilation database.

   Although it can be a little surprising at first glance, a compilation
   database target is, like any other target, subject to scons target
   selection rules. This means if you set a default target (that does not
   include the compilation database), or use command-line targets, it
   might not be selected for building. This can actually be an advantage,
   since you don't necessarily want to regenerate the compilation database
   every build. The following example shows selecting relative paths (the
   default) for output and source, and also giving a non-default name to
   the database. In order to be able to generate the database separately
   from building, an alias is set referring to the database, which can
   then be used as a target - here we are only building the compilation
   database target, not the code.
env = Environment()
env.Tool('compilation_db')
cdb = env.CompilationDatabase('compile_database.json')
Alias('cdb', cdb)
env.Program('test_main.c')

% scons -Q cdb
Building compilation database compile_database.json

   compile_database.json contains:
[
    {
        "command": "gcc -o test_main.o -c test_main.c",
        "directory": "/home/user/sandbox",
        "file": "test_main.c",
        "output": "test_main.o"
    }
]

   The following (incomplete) example shows using filtering to separate
   build variants. In the case of using variants, you want different
   compilation databases for each, since the build parameters differ, so
   the code analysis needs to see the correct build lines for the 32-bit
   build and 64-bit build hinted at here. For simplicity of presentation,
   the example omits the setup details of the variant directories:
env = Environment()
env.Tool("compilation_db")

env1 = env.Clone()
env1["COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER"] = "build/linux32/*"
env1.CompilationDatabase("compile_commands-linux32.json")

env2 = env.Clone()
env2["COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER"] = "build/linux64/*"
env2.CompilationDatabase('compile_commands-linux64.json')

   compile_commands-linux32.json contains:
[
    {
        "command": "gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c",
        "directory": "/home/mats/github/scons/exp/compdb",
        "file": "hello.c",
        "output": "hello.o"
    }
]

   compile_commands-linux64.json contains:
[
    {
        "command": "gcc -m64 -o build/linux64/test_main.o -c test_main.c",
        "directory": "/home/user/sandbox",
        "file": "test_main.c",
        "output": "build/linux64/test_main.o"
    }
]

27.2. Ninja Build Generator

Note

   This is an experimental new feature. It is subject to change and/or
   removal without a depreciation cycle.

   Loading the [455]ninja tool into SCons will make significant changes in
   SCons' normal functioning.
     * SCons will no longer execute any commands directly and will only
       create the build.ninja and run ninja.
     * Any targets specified on the command line will be passed along to
       ninja

   To enable this feature you'll need to use one of the following:
# On the command line --experimental=ninja

# Or in your SConstruct
SetOption('experimental', 'ninja')

   Ninja is a small build system that tries to be fast by not making
   decisions. SCons can at times be slow because it makes lots of
   decisions to carry out its goal of "correctness". The two tools can be
   paired to benefit some build scenarios: by using the [456]ninja tool,
   SCons can generate the build file ninja uses (basically doing the
   decision-making ahead of time and recording that for ninja), and can
   invoke ninja to perform a build. For situations where relationships are
   not changing, such as edit/build/debug iterations, this works fine and
   should provide considerable speedups for more complex builds. The
   implication is if there are larger changes taking place, ninja is not
   as appropriate - but you can always use SCons to regenerate the build
   file. You are NOT advised to use this for production builds.

   To use the [457]ninja tool you'll need to first install the Python
   ninja package, as the tool depends on being able to do an import of the
   package. This can be done via:
# In a virtualenv, or "python" is the native executable:
python -m pip install ninja

# Windows using Python launcher:
py -m pip install ninja

# Anaconda:
conda install -c conda-forge ninja

   Reminder that like any non-default tool, you need to initialize it
   before use (e.g. env.Tool('ninja')).

   It is not expected that the [458]Ninja builder will work for all builds
   at this point. It is still under active development. If you find that
   your build doesn't work with ninja please bring this to the [459]users
   mailing list or [460]#scons-help channel on our Discord server.

   Specifically if your build has many (or even any) Python function
   actions you may find that the ninja build will be slower as it will run
   ninja, which will then run SCons for each target created by a Python
   action. To alleviate some of these, especially those Python based
   actions built into SCons there is special logic to implement those
   actions via shell commands in the ninja build file.

   When ninja runs the generated ninja build file, ninja will launch scons
   as a daemon and feed commands to that scons process which ninja is
   unable to build directly. This daemon will stay alive until explicitly
   killed, or it times out. The timeout is set by
   [461]$NINJA_SCONS_DAEMON_KEEP_ALIVE .

   The daemon will be restarted if any SConscript file(s) change or the
   build changes in a way that ninja determines it needs to regenerate the
   build.ninja file

   See:
   [462]Ninja Build System
   [463]Ninja File Format Specification

Chapter 28. Troubleshooting

   The experience of configuring any software build tool to build a large
   code base usually, at some point, involves trying to figure out why the
   tool is behaving a certain way, and how to get it to behave the way you
   want. SCons is no different. This appendix contains a number of
   different ways in which you can get some additional insight into SCons'
   behavior.

   Note that we're always interested in trying to improve how you can
   troubleshoot configuration problems. If you run into a problem that has
   you scratching your head, and which there just doesn't seem to be a
   good way to debug, odds are pretty good that someone else will run into
   the same problem, too. If so, please let the SCons development team
   know using the contact information at
   [464]https://scons.org/contact.html so that we can use your feedback to
   try to come up with a better way to help you, and others, get the
   necessary insight into SCons behavior to help identify and fix
   configuration issues.

28.1. Why is That Target Being Rebuilt? the --debug=explain Option

   Let's look at a simple example of a misconfigured build that causes a
   target to be rebuilt every time SCons is run:
# Intentionally misspell the output file name in the
# command used to create the file:
Command('file.out', 'file.in', 'cp $SOURCE file.oout')

   (Note to Windows users: The POSIX cp command copies the first file
   named on the command line to the second file. In our example, it copies
   the file.in file to the file.out file.)

   Now if we run SCons multiple times on this example, we see that it
   re-runs the cp command every time:
% scons -Q
cp file.in file.oout
% scons -Q
cp file.in file.oout
% scons -Q
cp file.in file.oout

   In this example, the underlying cause is obvious: we've intentionally
   misspelled the output file name in the cp command, so the command
   doesn't actually build the file.out file that we've told SCons to
   expect. But if the problem weren't obvious, it would be helpful to
   specify the --debug=explain option on the command line to have SCons
   tell us very specifically why it's decided to rebuild the target:
% scons -Q --debug=explain
scons: building `file.out' because it doesn't exist
cp file.in file.oout

   If this had been a more complicated example involving a lot of build
   output, having SCons tell us that it's trying to rebuild the target
   file because it doesn't exist would be an important clue that something
   was wrong with the command that we invoked to build it.

   Note that you can also use --warn=target-not-built which checks whether
   or not expected targets exist after a build rule is executed.
% scons -Q --warn=target-not-built
cp file.in file.oout

scons: warning: Cannot find target file.out after building
File "/Users/bdbaddog/devel/scons/git/as_scons/scripts/scons.py", line 97, in <m
odule>

   The --debug=explain option also comes in handy to help figure out what
   input file changed. Given a simple configuration that builds a program
   from three source files, changing one of the source files and
   rebuilding with the --debug=explain option shows very specifically why
   SCons rebuilds the files that it does:
% scons -Q
cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
cc -o file3.o -c file3.c
cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o
%     [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF file2.c]
% scons -Q --debug=explain
scons: rebuilding `file2.o' because `file2.c' changed
cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
scons: rebuilding `prog' because `file2.o' changed
cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o

   This becomes even more helpful in identifying when a file is rebuilt
   due to a change in an implicit dependency, such as an incuded .h file.
   If the file1.c and file3.c files in our example both included a hello.h
   file, then changing that included file and re-running SCons with the
   --debug=explain option will pinpoint that it's the change to the
   included file that starts the chain of rebuilds:
% scons -Q
cc -o file1.o -c -I. file1.c
cc -o file2.o -c -I. file2.c
cc -o file3.o -c -I. file3.c
cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o
%     [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
% scons -Q --debug=explain
scons: rebuilding `file1.o' because `hello.h' changed
cc -o file1.o -c -I. file1.c
scons: rebuilding `file3.o' because `hello.h' changed
cc -o file3.o -c -I. file3.c
scons: rebuilding `prog' because:
           `file1.o' changed
           `file3.o' changed
cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o

   (Note that the --debug=explain option will only tell you why SCons
   decided to rebuild necessary targets. It does not tell you what files
   it examined when deciding not to rebuild a target file, which is often
   a more valuable question to answer.)

28.2. What's in That Construction Environment? the Dump Method

   When you create a construction environment, SCons populates it with
   construction variables that are set up for various compilers, linkers
   and utilities that it finds on your system. Although this is usually
   helpful and what you want, it might be frustrating if SCons doesn't set
   certain variables that you expect to be set. In situations like this,
   it's sometimes helpful to use the construction environment [465]Dump
   method to print all or some of the construction variables. Note that
   the Dump method returns the representation of the variables in the
   environment for you to print (or otherwise manipulate):
env = Environment()
print(env.Dump())

   On a POSIX system with gcc installed, this might generate:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...

                '_InternalInstallAs': <function InstallAsBuilderWrapper at 0x700

   The construction environments in these examples have actually been
   restricted to just gcc and Visual C++, respectively. In a real-life
   situation, the construction environments will likely contain a great
   many more variables. Also note that we've massaged the example output
   above to make the memory address of all objects a constant 0x700000. In
   reality, you would see a different hexadecimal number for each object.

   To make it easier to see just what you're interested in, the Dump
   method allows you to specify a specific construction variable that you
   want to disply. For example, it's not unusual to want to verify the
   external environment used to execute build commands, to make sure that
   the PATH and other environment variables are set up the way they should
   be. You can do this as follows:
env = Environment()
print(env.Dump('ENV'))

   Which might display the following when executed on a POSIX system:
% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
{'PATH': '/usr/local/bin:/opt/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/snap/bin'}
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...

28.3. What Dependencies Does SCons Know About? the --tree Option

   Sometimes the best way to try to figure out what SCons is doing is
   simply to take a look at the dependency graph that it constructs based
   on your SConscript files. The --tree option will display all or part of
   the SCons dependency graph in an "ASCII art" graphical format that
   shows the dependency hierarchy.

   For example, given the following input SConstruct file:
env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
env.Program('prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

   Running SCons with the --tree=all option yields:
% scons -Q --tree=all
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
+-.
  +-SConstruct
  +-f1.c
  +-f1.o
  | +-f1.c
  | +-inc.h
  +-f2.c
  +-f2.o
  | +-f2.c
  | +-inc.h
  +-f3.c
  +-f3.o
  | +-f3.c

  +-inc.h
  +-prog
    +-f1.o

    +-f2.o
    | +-f2.c
    | +-inc.h
    +-f3.o
      +-f3.c
      +-inc.h

   The tree will also be printed when the -n (no execute) option is used,
   which allows you to examine the dependency graph for a configuration
   without actually rebuilding anything in the tree.

   By default SCons uses "ASCII art" to draw the tree. It is possible to
   use line-drawing characters (Unicode calls these Box Drawing) to make a
   nicer display. To do this, add the linedraw qualifier:
% scons -Q --tree=all,linedraw
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
+-+.
  +-SConstruct
  +-f1.c

    | +-f2.c
    | +-inc.h
    +-+f3.o
      +-f3.c
      +-inc.h

   The --tree option only prints the dependency graph for the specified
   targets (or the default target(s) if none are specified on the command
   line). So if you specify a target like f2.o on the command line, the
   --tree option will only print the dependency graph for that file:
% scons -Q --tree=all f2.o
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
+-f2.o
  +-f2.c
  +-inc.h

   This is, of course, useful for restricting the output from a very large
   build configuration to just a portion in which you're interested.
   Multiple targets are fine, in which case a tree will be printed for
   each specified target:
% scons -Q --tree=all f1.o f3.o
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
+-f1.o
  +-f1.c
  +-inc.h
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
+-f3.o
  +-f3.c
  +-inc.h

   The status argument may be used to tell SCons to print status
   information about each file in the dependency graph:
% scons -Q --tree=status
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o

  R        = exists in repository only
   b       = implicit builder
   B       = explicit builder
    S      = side effect
     P     = precious
      A    = always build
       C   = current
        N  = no clean
         H = no cache

[E B   C  ]    +-f3.o
[E     C  ]      +-f3.c
[E     C  ]      +-inc.h

   Note that --tree=all,status is equivalent; the all is assumed if only
   status is present. As an alternative to all, you can specify
   --tree=derived to have SCons only print derived targets in the tree
   output, skipping source files (like .c and .h files):
% scons -Q --tree=derived
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c

+-.
  +-f1.o
  +-f2.o
  +-f3.o
  +-prog
    +-f1.o
    +-f2.o

   You can use the status modifier with derived as well:
% scons -Q --tree=derived,status
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
 E         = exists
  R        = exists in repository only
   b       = implicit builder
   B       = explicit builder
    S      = side effect
     P     = precious
      A    = always build
       C   = current
        N  = no clean
         H = no cache

[E b      ]+-.
[E B   C  ]  +-f1.o
[E B   C  ]  +-f2.o
[E B   C  ]  +-f3.o
[E B   C  ]  +-prog
[E B   C  ]    +-f1.o
[E B   C  ]    +-f2.o
[E B   C  ]    +-f3.o

   Note that the order of the --tree= arguments doesn't matter;
   --tree=status,derived is completely equivalent.

   The default behavior of the --tree option is to repeat all of the
   dependencies each time the library dependency (or any other dependency
   file) is encountered in the tree. If certain target files share other
   target files, such as two programs that use the same library:
env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'],
                  LIBS = ['foo'],
                  LIBPATH = ['.'])
env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
env.Program('prog1.c')
env.Program('prog2.c')

   Then there can be a lot of repetition in the --tree= output:
% scons -Q --tree=all
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c

   In a large configuration with many internal libraries and include
   files, this can very quickly lead to huge output trees. To help make
   this more manageable, a prune modifier may be added to the option list,
   in which case SCons will print the name of a target that has already
   been visited during the tree-printing in square brackets ([]) as an
   indication that the dependencies of the target file may be found by
   looking farther up the tree:
% scons -Q --tree=prune
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c

28.4. How is SCons Constructing the Command Lines It Executes? the
--debug=presub Option

   Sometimes the command lines that SCons executes don't come out looking
   as you expect. In this case it may be useful to look at the strings
   before SCons performs substitution on them. This can be done with the
   --debug=presub option:
% scons -Q --debug=presub
Building prog.o with action:
  $CC -o $TARGET -c $CFLAGS $CCFLAGS $_CCOMCOM $SOURCES
cc -o prog.o -c -I. prog.c
Building prog with action:
  $SMART_LINKCOM
cc -o prog prog.o

28.5. Where is SCons Searching for Libraries? the --debug=findlibs Option

   To get some insight into what library names SCons is searching for, and
   in which directories it is searching, Use the --debug=findlibs option.
   Given the following input SConstruct file:
env = Environment(LIBPATH = ['libs1', 'libs2'])
env.Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo', 'bar'])

   And the libraries libfoo.a and libbar.a in libs1 and libs2,
   respectively, use of the --debug=findlibs option yields:
% scons -Q --debug=findlibs
  findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.a' in 'libs1' ...
  findlibs: ... FOUND 'libfoo.a' in 'libs1'
  findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.so' in 'libs1' ...
  findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.so' in 'libs2' ...
  findlibs: looking for 'libbar.a' in 'libs1' ...
  findlibs: looking for 'libbar.a' in 'libs2' ...
  findlibs: ... FOUND 'libbar.a' in 'libs2'
  findlibs: looking for 'libbar.so' in 'libs1' ...
  findlibs: looking for 'libbar.so' in 'libs2' ...
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o -Llibs1 -Llibs2 -lfoo -lbar

28.6. Where is SCons Blowing Up? the --debug=stacktrace Option

   In general, SCons tries to keep its error messages short and
   informative. That means we usually try to avoid showing the stack
   traces that are familiar to experienced Python programmers, since they
   usually contain much more information than is useful to most people.

   For example, the following SConstruct file:
Program('prog.c')

   Generates the following error if the prog.c file does not exist:
% scons -Q
scons: *** [prog.o] Source `prog.c' not found, needed by target `prog.o'.

   In this case, the error is pretty obvious. But if it weren't, and you
   wanted to try to get more information about the error, the
   --debug=stacktrace option would show you exactly where in the SCons
   source code the problem occurs:
% scons -Q --debug=stacktrace
scons: *** [prog.o] Source `prog.c' not found, needed by target `prog.o'.
scons: internal stack trace:
  File "SCons/Job.py", line 203, in start
    task.prepare()
  File "SCons/Script/Main.py", line 180, in prepare
    return SCons.Taskmaster.OutOfDateTask.prepare(self)
  File "SCons/Taskmaster.py", line 186, in prepare
    executor.prepare()
  File "SCons/Executor.py", line 418, in prepare
    raise SCons.Errors.StopError(msg % (s, self.batches[0].targets[0]))

   Of course, if you do need to dive into the SCons source code, we'd like
   to know if, or how, the error messages or troubleshooting options could
   have been improved to avoid that. Not everyone has the necessary time
   or Python skill to dive into the source code, and we'd like to improve
   SCons for those people as well...

28.7. How is SCons Making Its Decisions? the --taskmastertrace Option

   The internal SCons subsystem that handles walking the dependency graph
   and controls the decision-making about what to rebuild is the
   Taskmaster. SCons supports a --taskmastertrace option that tells the
   Taskmaster to print information about the children (dependencies) of
   the various Nodes on its walk down the graph, which specific dependent
   Nodes are being evaluated, and in what order.

   The --taskmastertrace option takes as an argument the name of a file in
   which to put the trace output, with - (a single hyphen) indicating that
   the trace messages should be printed to the standard output:
env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
env.Program('prog.c')

% scons -Q --taskmastertrace=- prog

Taskmaster: Looking for a node to evaluate

cc -o prog prog.o
Task.executed_with_callbacks(): node <executing  0   'prog'>
Task.postprocess():  node <executed   0   'prog'>

Taskmaster: Looking for a node to evaluate
Taskmaster: No candidate anymore.

   The --taskmastertrace option doesn't provide information about the
   actual calculations involved in deciding if a file is up-to-date, but
   it does show all of the dependencies it knows about for each Node, and
   the order in which those dependencies are evaluated. This can be useful
   as an alternate way to determine whether or not your SCons
   configuration, or the implicit dependency scan, has actually identified
   all the correct dependencies you want it to.

28.8. Watch SCons prepare targets for building: the --debug=prepare Option

   Sometimes SCons doesn't build the target you want and it's difficult to
   figure out why. You can use the --debug=prepare option to see all the
   targets SCons is considering, and whether they are already up-to-date
   or not. The message is printed before SCons decides whether to build
   the target.

28.9. Why is a file disappearing? the --debug=duplicate Option

   When using the Duplicate option to create variant dirs, sometimes you
   may find files not getting linked or copied to where you expect (or not
   at all), or files mysteriously disappearing. These are usually because
   of a misconfiguration of some kind in the SConscript files, but they
   can be tricky to debug. The --debug=duplicate option shows each time a
   variant file is unlinked and relinked from its source (or copied,
   depending on settings), and also shows a message for removing "stale"
   variant-dir files that no longer have a corresponding source file. It
   also prints a line for each target that's removed just before building,
   since that can also be mistaken for the same thing.

28.10. Keep it simple

   Over the years, many developers have chosen to dive in and make vastly
   complicated build systems out of SCons, which sometimes don't work
   quite as expected. As a general rule, make sure you need to reach for a
   complex solution before you do so. SCons is mature software and has
   evolved over time to meet a lot of feature requests, so there is often
   an easier way to do something if you can just find it. The SCons
   community can be helpful here - the discussion lists and chat channels
   can be a way to find out if something can be done an easier way before
   embarking on an implementation.

   When something does misbehave, trying to isolate the problem to a
   simple test case can really help. The work to create a reproducer often
   helps you spot the issue yourself, and a simple example is much easier
   for others to look over and possibly spot logical flaws, misuse of the
   API, or other ways something could have been done. In addition, if it
   turns out there's actually a real SCons bug (we believe it's a high
   quality piece of software, but all software has some bugs), it's very
   likely the bug filing will result in a request for a simple reproducer
   anyway.

Appendix A. Construction Variables

   This appendix contains descriptions of all of the construction
   variables that are potentially available "out of the box" in this
   version of SCons. Whether or not setting a construction variable in a
   construction environment will actually have an effect depends on
   whether any of the Tools and/or Builders that use the variable have
   been included in the construction environment.

   In this appendix, we have appended the initial $ (dollar sign) to the
   beginning of each variable name when it appears in the text, but left
   off the dollar sign in the left-hand column where the name appears for
   each entry.

   __LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          This construction variable automatically introduces
          [466]$_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS if [467]$LDMODULEVERSION is set.
          Othervise it evaluates to an empty string.

   __SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          This construction variable automatically introduces
          [468]$_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS if [469]$SHLIBVERSION is set. Othervise
          it evaluates to an empty string.

   APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag:
          -compatibility_version

          The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and
          65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and 255, Z can be omitted
          or between 1 and 255. This value will be derived from
          [470]$SHLIBVERSION if not specified. The lowest digit will be
          dropped and replaced by a 0.

          If the [471]$APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION is set then no
          -compatibility_version will be output.

          See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

   _APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the
          linker flags to specify apple's linker's -compatibility_version
          flag. The default generator uses
          [472]$APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and
          [473]$APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and [474]$SHLIBVERSION
          to determine the correct flag.

   APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION
          On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag:
          -current_version

          The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and
          65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and 255, Z can be omitted
          or between 1 and 255. This value will be set to
          [475]$SHLIBVERSION if not specified.

          If the [476]$APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION is set then no
          -current_version will be output.

          See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

   _APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION
          A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the
          linker flags to specify apple's linker's -current_version flag.
          The default generator uses [477]$APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION and
          [478]$APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION and [479]$SHLIBVERSION to
          determine the correct flag.

   APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable
          adding -compatibility_version flag when generating versioned
          shared libraries.

          This overrides [480]$APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION.

   APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION
          Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable
          adding -current_version flag when generating versioned shared
          libraries.

          This overrides [481]$APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION.

   AR
          The static library archiver.

   ARCHITECTURE
          Specifies the system architecture for which the package is being
          built. The default is the system architecture of the machine on
          which SCons is running. This is used to fill in the
          Architecture: field in an Ipkg control file, and the BuildArch:
          field in the RPM .spec file, as well as forming part of the name
          of a generated RPM package file.

          See the [482]Package builder.

   ARCOM
          The command line used to generate a static library from object
          files.

   ARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a static library is generated from
          object files. If this is not set, then [483]$ARCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   ARFLAGS
          General options passed to the static library archiver.

   AS
          The assembler.

   ASCOM
          The command line used to generate an object file from an
          assembly-language source file.

   ASCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file. If this is not set, then
          [484]$ASCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

   ASFLAGS
          General options passed to the assembler.

   ASPPCOM
          The command line used to assemble an assembly-language source
          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. Any options specified in the [485]$ASFLAGS
          and [486]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line.

   ASPPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file after first running the file
          through the C preprocessor. If this is not set, then
          [487]$ASPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASPPCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

   ASPPFLAGS
          General options when an assembling an assembly-language source
          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. The default is to use the value of
          [488]$ASFLAGS.

   BIBTEX
          The bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter
          and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   BIBTEXCOM
          The command line used to call the bibliography generator for the
          TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter.

   BIBTEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a bibliography for TeX or
          LaTeX. If this is not set, then [489]$BIBTEXCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(BIBTEXCOMSTR = "Generating bibliography $TARGET")

   BIBTEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the bibliography generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   BUILDERS
          A dictionary mapping the names of the builders available through
          the construction environment to underlying Builder objects.
          Custom builders need to be added to this to make them available.

          A platform-dependent default list of builders such as
          [490]Program, [491]Library etc. is used to populate this
          construction variable when the construction environment is
          initialized via the presence/absence of the tools those builders
          depend on. $BUILDERS can be examined to learn which builders
          will actually be available at run-time.

          Note that if you initialize this construction variable through
          assignment when the construction environment is created, that
          value for $BUILDERS will override any defaults:

bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'NewBuilder': bld})

          To instead use a new Builder object in addition to the default
          Builders, add your new Builder object like this:

env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS={'NewBuilder': bld})

          or this:

env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS']['NewBuilder'] = bld

   CACHEDIR_CLASS
          The class type that SCons should use when instantiating a new
          [492]CacheDir for the given environment. It must be a subclass
          of the SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir class.

   CC
          The C compiler.

   CCCOM
          The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static)
          object file. Any options specified in the [493]$CFLAGS,
          [494]$CCFLAGS and [495]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are
          included on this command line. See also [496]$SHCCCOM for
          compiling to shared objects.

   CCCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a C source file is compiled to
          a (static) object file. If not set, then [497]$CCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed. See also [498]$SHCCCOMSTR for
          compiling to shared objects.

env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CCDEPFLAGS
          Options to pass to C or C++ compiler to generate list of
          dependency files.

          This is set only by compilers which support this functionality.
          ([499]gcc, [500]clang, and [501]msvc currently)

   CCFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C and C++ compilers. See
          also [502]$SHCCFLAGS for compiling to shared objects.

   CCPCHFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support building
          with precompiled headers. The default value expands expands to
          the appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options when
          the [503]$PCH construction variable is set.

   CCPDBFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support storing
          debugging information in a Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file. The
          default value expands expands to appropriate Microsoft Visual
          C++ command-line options when the [504]$PDB construction
          variable is set.

          The Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by default to
          generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with
          parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in
          the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single
          PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only
          way to get debug information embedded into a static library.
          Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance,
          although parallel builds will no longer work.

          You can generate PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the
          default [505]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = ['${(PDB and "/Zi /Fd%s" % File(PDB)) or ""}']

          An alternative would be to use the /Zi to put the debugging
          information in a separate .pdb file for each object file by
          overriding the [506]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = '/Zi /Fd${TARGET}.pdb'

   CCVERSION
          The version number of the C compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C compiler being used.

   CFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C source files. This is used by the internal
          CFile builder when generating C files from Lex (.l) or YACC (.y)
          input files. The default suffix, of course, is .c (lower case).
          On case-insensitive systems (like Windows), SCons also treats .C
          (upper case) files as C files.

   CFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C compiler (C only; not
          C++). See also [507]$SHCFLAGS for compiling to shared objects.

   CHANGE_SPECFILE
          A hook for modifying the file that controls the packaging build
          (the .spec for RPM, the control for Ipkg, the .wxs for MSI). If
          set, the function will be called after the SCons template for
          the file has been written.

          See the [508]Package builder.

   CHANGED_SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   CHANGED_TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   CHANGELOG
          The name of a file containing the change log text to be included
          in the package. This is included as the %changelog section of
          the RPM .spec file.

          See the [509]Package builder.

   COMPILATIONDB_COMSTR
          The string displayed when the [510]CompilationDatabase builder's
          action is run.

   COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER
          A string which instructs [511]CompilationDatabase to only
          include entries where the output member matches the pattern in
          the filter string using fnmatch, which uses glob style
          wildcards.

          The default value is an empty string '', which disables
          filtering.

   COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH
          A boolean flag to instruct [512]CompilationDatabase whether to
          write the file and output members in the compilation database
          using absolute or relative paths.

          The default value is False (use relative paths)

   _concat
          A function used to produce variables like [513]$_CPPINCFLAGS. It
          takes four mandatory arguments, and up to 4 additional optional
          arguments: 1) a prefix to concatenate onto each element, 2) a
          list of elements, 3) a suffix to concatenate onto each element,
          4) an environment for variable interpolation, 5) an optional
          function that will be called to transform the list before
          concatenation, 6) an optionally specified target (Can use
          TARGET), 7) an optionally specified source (Can use SOURCE), 8)
          optional affect_signature flag which will wrap non-empty
          returned value with $( and $) to indicate the contents should
          not affect the signature of the generated command line.

        env['_CPPINCFLAGS'] = '${_concat(INCPREFIX, CPPPATH, INCSUFFIX, __env__,
 RDirs, TARGET, SOURCE, affect_signature=False)}'

   CONFIGUREDIR
          The name of the directory in which Configure context test files
          are written. The default is .sconf_temp in the top-level
          directory containing the SConstruct file.

   CONFIGURELOG
          The name of the Configure context log file. The default is
          config.log in the top-level directory containing the SConstruct
          file.

   _CPPDEFFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options to define values. The value
          of [514]$_CPPDEFFLAGS is created by respectively prepending and
          appending [515]$CPPDEFPREFIX and [516]$CPPDEFSUFFIX to each
          definition in [517]$CPPDEFINES.

   CPPDEFINES
          A platform independent specification of C preprocessor macro
          definitions. The definitions will be added to command lines
          through the automatically-generated [518]$_CPPDEFFLAGS
          construction variable (see above), which is constructed
          according to the type of value of $CPPDEFINES:

          If $CPPDEFINES is a string, the values of the [519]$CPPDEFPREFIX
          and [520]$CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be
          respectively prepended and appended to each definition in
          [521]$CPPDEFINES.

# Will add -Dxyz to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /Dxyz to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES='xyz')

          If $CPPDEFINES is a list, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be respectively
          prepended and appended to each element in the list. If any
          element is a list or tuple, then the first item is the name
          being defined and the second item is its value:

# Will add -DB=2 -DA to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DB=2 /DA to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('B', 2), 'A'])

          If $CPPDEFINES is a dictionary, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX
          and $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be respectively
          prepended and appended to each item from the dictionary. The key
          of each dictionary item is a name being defined to the
          dictionary item's corresponding value; if the value is None,
          then the name is defined without an explicit value. Note that
          the resulting flags are sorted by keyword to ensure that the
          order of the options on the command line is consistent each time
          scons is run.

# Will add -DA -DB=2 to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DA /DB=2 to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES={'B':2, 'A':None})

   CPPDEFPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify preprocessor macro definitions on the
          C compiler command line. This will be prepended to each
          definition in the [522]$CPPDEFINES construction variable when
          the [523]$_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPDEFSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify preprocessor macro definitions on the
          C compiler command line. This will be appended to each
          definition in the [524]$CPPDEFINES construction variable when
          the [525]$_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPFLAGS
          User-specified C preprocessor options. These will be included in
          any command that uses the C preprocessor, including not just
          compilation of C and C++ source files via the [526]$CCCOM,
          [527]$SHCCCOM, [528]$CXXCOM and [529]$SHCXXCOM command lines,
          but also the [530]$FORTRANPPCOM, [531]$SHFORTRANPPCOM,
          [532]$F77PPCOM and [533]$SHF77PPCOM command lines used to
          compile a Fortran source file, and the [534]$ASPPCOM command
          line used to assemble an assembly language source file, after
          first running each file through the C preprocessor. Note that
          this variable does not contain -I (or similar) include search
          path options that scons generates automatically from
          [535]$CPPPATH. See [536]$_CPPINCFLAGS, below, for the variable
          that expands to those options.

   _CPPINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files. The value of $_CPPINCFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending [537]$INCPREFIX
          and [538]$INCSUFFIX to each directory in [539]$CPPPATH.

   CPPPATH
          The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for
          include directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. In general it's not
          advised to put include directory directives directly into
          [540]$CCFLAGS or [541]$CXXFLAGS as the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. $CPPPATH should be a list of path strings,
          or a single string, not a pathname list joined by Python's
          os.sep.

          Note: directory names in $CPPPATH will be looked-up relative to
          the directory of the SConscript file when they are used in a
          command. To force scons to look-up a directory relative to the
          root of the source tree use the # prefix:

env = Environment(CPPPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the [542]Dir
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(CPPPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [543]$_CPPINCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and
          appending the values of the [544]$INCPREFIX and [545]$INCSUFFIX
          construction variables to each directory in [546]$CPPPATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the $CPPPATH directory list
          should include [547]$_CPPINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(CCCOM="my_compiler $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   CPPSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for C
          preprocessor implicit dependencies (#include lines). The default
          list is:

[".c", ".C", ".cxx", ".cpp", ".c++", ".cc",
 ".h", ".H", ".hxx", ".hpp", ".hh",
 ".F", ".fpp", ".FPP",
 ".m", ".mm",
 ".S", ".spp", ".SPP"]

   CXX
          The C++ compiler. See also [548]$SHCXX for compiling to shared
          objects..

   CXXCOM
          The command line used to compile a C++ source file to an object
          file. Any options specified in the [549]$CXXFLAGS and
          [550]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. See also [551]$SHCXXCOM for compiling to shared
          objects..

   CXXCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a C++ source file is compiled
          to a (static) object file. If not set, then [552]$CXXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed. See also [553]$SHCXXCOMSTR for
          compiling to shared objects..

env = Environment(CXXCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C++ source files. This is used by the internal
          CXXFile builder when generating C++ files from Lex (.ll) or YACC
          (.yy) input files. The default suffix is .cc. SCons also treats
          files with the suffixes .cpp, .cxx, .c++, and .C++ as C++ files,
          and files with .mm suffixes as Objective C++ files. On
          case-sensitive systems (Linux, UNIX, and other POSIX-alikes),
          SCons also treats .C (upper case) files as C++ files.

   CXXFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C++ compiler. By default,
          this includes the value of [554]$CCFLAGS, so that setting
          $CCFLAGS affects both C and C++ compilation. If you want to add
          C++-specific flags, you must set or override the value of
          [555]$CXXFLAGS. See also [556]$SHCXXFLAGS for compiling to
          shared objects..

   CXXVERSION
          The version number of the C++ compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C++ compiler being used.

   DC
          The D compiler to use. See also [557]$SHDC for compiling to
          shared objects.

   DCOM
          The command line used to compile a D file to an object file. Any
          options specified in the [558]$DFLAGS construction variable is
          included on this command line. See also [559]$SHDCOM for
          compiling to shared objects.

   DCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a D source file is compiled to
          a (static) object file. If not set, then [560]$DCOM (the command
          line) is displayed. See also [561]$SHDCOMSTR for compiling to
          shared objects.

   DDEBUG
          List of debug tags to enable when compiling.

   DDEBUGPREFIX
          DDEBUGPREFIX.

   DDEBUGSUFFIX
          DDEBUGSUFFIX.

          converter.

   DVIPS
          The TeX DVI file to PostScript converter.

   DVIPSFLAGS
          General options passed to the TeX DVI file to PostScript
          converter.

   ENV
          The execution environment - a dictionary of environment
          variables used when SCons invokes external commands to build
          targets defined in this construction environment. When $ENV is
          passed to a command, all list values are assumed to be path
          lists and are joined using the search path separator. Any other
          non-string values are coerced to a string.

          Note that by default SCons does not propagate the environment in
          effect when you execute scons (the "shell environment") to the
          execution environment. This is so that builds will be guaranteed
          repeatable regardless of the environment variables set at the
          time scons is invoked. If you want to propagate a shell
          environment variable to the commands executed to build target
          files, you must do so explicitly. A common example is the system
          PATH environment variable, so that scons will find utilities the
          same way as the invoking shell (or other process):

import os
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})

          Although it is usually not recommended, you can propagate the
          entire shell environment in one go:

import os
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())

   ESCAPE
          A function that will be called to escape shell special
          characters in command lines. The function should take one
          argument: the command line string to escape; and should return
          the escaped command line.

   F03
          The Fortran 03 compiler. You should normally set the
          [576]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [577]$F03 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 03 files.

   F03COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 03 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [578]$F03COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 03 files. You should
          normally set the [579]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F03COMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 03 source file is
          compiled to an object file. If not set, then [580]$F03COM or
          [581]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F03FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F03 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f03']

   F03FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 03
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [582]$F03PATH. See [583]$_F03INCFLAGS below,
          for the variable that expands to those options. You only need to
          set [584]$F03FLAGS if you need to define specific user options
          for Fortran 03 files. You should normally set the
          [585]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F03INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 03 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [586]$_F03INCFLAGS is created by appending [587]$INCPREFIX and
          [588]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [589]$F03PATH.

   F03PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 03 compiler will search

          command line. You only need to set [717]$F95PPCOM if you need to
          use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 95 files.
          You should normally set the [718]$FORTRANPPCOM variable, which
          specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F95PPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is
          compiled to an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. If not set, then [719]$F95PPCOM or
          [720]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F95PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F95 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty.

   File
          A function that converts a string into a File instance relative
          to the target being built.

   FORTRAN
          The default Fortran compiler for all versions of Fortran.

   FORTRANCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file. By default, any options specified in the
          [721]$FORTRANFLAGS, [722]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and
          [723]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction variables are included on
          this command line.

   FORTRANCOMMONFLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran
          compiler. Similar to [724]$FORTRANFLAGS, but this variable is
          applied to all dialects.

   FORTRANCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran source file is
          compiled to an object file. If not set, then [725]$FORTRANCOM
          (the command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the FORTRAN dialect will
          be used. By default, this is ['.f', '.for', '.ftn']

   FORTRANFLAGS
          General user-specified options for the FORTRAN dialect that are
          passed to the Fortran compiler. Note that this variable does not
          contain -I (or similar) include or module search path options
          that scons generates automatically from [726]$FORTRANPATH. See
          [727]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS and [728]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, below, for the
          variables that expand those options.

   _FORTRANINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files and module files. The value of
          [729]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS is created by respectively prepending and
          appending [730]$INCPREFIX and [731]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning
          and end of each directory in [732]$FORTRANPATH.

   FORTRANMODDIR
          Directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files it generates. This variable is empty, by default.
          Some Fortran compilers will internally append this directory in
          the search path for module files, as well.

   FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be prepended to the beginning
          of the directory in the [733]$FORTRANMODDIR construction
          variables when the [734]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is
          automatically generated.

   FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of the
          directory in the [735]$FORTRANMODDIR construction variables when
          the [736]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is automatically generated.

   _FORTRANMODFLAG
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line option for specifying the
          directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files that happen to get generated during compilation.
          The value of [737]$_FORTRANMODFLAG is created by respectively
          prepending and appending [738]$FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX and
          [739]$FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and end of the
          directory in [740]$FORTRANMODDIR.

   FORTRANMODPREFIX
          The module file prefix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is left empty, by default. For situations
          in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal
          convention, the user may use this variable. Its value will be
          appended to every module file name as scons attempts to resolve
          dependencies.

   FORTRANMODSUFFIX
          The module file suffix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is set to ".mod", by default. For
          situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the
          normal convention, the user may use this variable. Its value
          will be appended to every module file name as scons attempts to
          resolve dependencies.

   FORTRANPATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran compiler will search
          for include files and (for some compilers) module files. The
          Fortran implicit dependency scanner will search these
          directories for include files (but not module files since they
          are autogenerated and, as such, may not actually exist at the
          time the scan takes place). Don't explicitly put include
          directory arguments in FORTRANFLAGS because the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. Note: directory names in FORTRANPATH will be
          looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are
          used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(FORTRANPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(FORTRANPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [741]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and
          appending the values of the [742]$INCPREFIX and [743]$INCSUFFIX
          construction variables to the beginning and end of each
          directory in [744]$FORTRANPATH. Any command lines you define
          that need the FORTRANPATH directory list should include
          [745]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(FORTRANCOM="my_compiler $_FORTRANINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURC
E")

   FORTRANPPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. By default, any options specified in the
          [746]$FORTRANFLAGS, [747]$CPPFLAGS, [748]$_CPPDEFFLAGS,
          [749]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and [750]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variables are included on this command line.

   FORTRANPPCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when a Fortran source file is
          compiled to an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. If not set, then [751]$FORTRANPPCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANPPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for FORTRAN dialect will be used. By default,
          this is ['.fpp', '.FPP']

   FORTRANSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for Fortran
          implicit dependencies (INCLUDE lines and USE statements). The
          default list is:

[".f", ".F", ".for", ".FOR", ".ftn", ".FTN", ".fpp", ".FPP",
".f77", ".F77", ".f90", ".F90", ".f95", ".F95"]

   FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list containing the paths to search for
          frameworks. Used by the compiler to find framework-style
          includes like #include <Fmwk/Header.h>. Used by the linker to
          find user-specified frameworks when linking (see
          [752]$FRAMEWORKS). For example:

env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKPATH='#myframeworkdir')

          will add

... -Fmyframeworkdir

          to the compiler and linker command lines.

   _FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options
          corresponding to [753]$FRAMEWORKPATH.

   FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for the
          FRAMEWORKPATH entries. (see [754]$FRAMEWORKPATH). The default
          value is -F.

   FRAMEWORKPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for linking in
          frameworks (see [755]$FRAMEWORKS). The default value is
          -framework.

   FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list of the framework names to be linked
          into a program or shared library or bundle. The default value is
          the empty list. For example:

env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKS=Split('System Cocoa SystemConfiguration'))

   _FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options for linking
          with FRAMEWORKS.

   FRAMEWORKSFLAGS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, general user-supplied frameworks options
          to be added at the end of a command line building a loadable
          module. (This has been largely superseded by the
          [756]$FRAMEWORKPATH, [757]$FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX,
          [758]$FRAMEWORKPREFIX and [759]$FRAMEWORKS variables described
          above.)

   GS
          The Ghostscript program used to, for example, convert PostScript
          to PDF files.

   GSCOM
          The full Ghostscript command line used for the conversion
          process. Its default value is "$GS $GSFLAGS -sOutputFile=$TARGET
          $SOURCES".

   GSCOMSTR
          The string displayed when Ghostscript is called for the
          conversion process. If this is not set (the default), then
          [760]$GSCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   GSFLAGS
          General options passed to the Ghostscript program, when
          converting PostScript to PDF files for example. Its default
          value is "-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite"

   HOST_ARCH
          The name of the host hardware architecture used to create this
          construction environment. The platform code sets this when
          initializing (see [761]$PLATFORM and the platform argument to
          [762]Environment). Note the detected name of the architecture
          may not be identical to that returned by the Python
          platform.machine method.

          On the win32 platform, if the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is
          available, [763]msvc tool setup is done using $HOST_ARCH and
          [764]$TARGET_ARCH. Changing the values at any later time will
          not cause the tool to be reinitialized. Valid host arch values
          are x86 and arm for 32-bit hosts and amd64 and x86_64 for 64-bit
          hosts.

          Should be considered immutable. $HOST_ARCH is not currently used
          by other platforms, but the option is reserved to do so in
          future

   HOST_OS
          The name of the host operating system for the platform used to
          create this construction environment. The platform code sets
          this when initializing (see [765]$PLATFORM and the platform
          argument to [766]Environment).

          Should be considered immutable. $HOST_OS is not currently used
          by SCons, but the option is reserved to do so in future

   IDLSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for IDL
          implicit dependencies (#include or import lines). The default
          list is:

[".idl", ".IDL"]

   IMPLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          Used to override
          [767]$SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS/[768]$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          when creating versioned import library for a shared
          library/loadable module. If not defined, then
          [769]$SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS/[770]$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS is
          used to determine whether to disable symlink generation or not.

   IMPLIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for import library names. For example, cygwin
          uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in pair with dynamic
          libraries (cygfoo.dll). The [771]cyglink linker sets
          [772]$IMPLIBPREFIX to 'lib' and [773]$SHLIBPREFIX to 'cyg'.

   IMPLIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for import library names. For example, cygwin
          uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in pair with dynamic
          libraries (cygfoo.dll). The [774]cyglink linker sets
          [775]$IMPLIBSUFFIX to '.dll.a' and [776]$SHLIBSUFFIX to '.dll'.

   IMPLIBVERSION
          Used to override [777]$SHLIBVERSION/[778]$LDMODULEVERSION when
          generating versioned import library for a shared
          library/loadable module. If undefined, the
          [779]$SHLIBVERSION/[780]$LDMODULEVERSION is used to determine
          the version of versioned import library.

   IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES
          Controls whether or not SCons will add implicit dependencies for
          the commands executed to build targets.

          By default, SCons will add to each target an implicit dependency
          on the command represented by the first argument of any command
          line it executes (which is typically the command itself). By
          setting such a dependency, SCons can determine that a target
          should be rebuilt if the command changes, such as when a
          compiler is upgraded to a new version. The specific file for the
          dependency is found by searching the PATH variable in the ENV
          dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the
          command. The default is the same as setting the construction
          variable $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES to a True-like value
          ("true", "yes", or "1" - but not a number greater than one, as
          that has a different meaning).

          Action strings can be segmented by the use of an AND operator,
          &&. In a segemented string, each segment is a separate "command
          line", these are run sequentially until one fails or the entire
          sequence has been executed. If an action string is segmented,
          then the selected behavior of $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is
          applied to each segment.

          If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to a False-like value
          ("none", "false", "no", "0", etc.), then the implicit dependency
          will not be added to the targets built with that construction
          environment.

          If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to "2" or higher, then
          that number of arguments in the command line will be scanned for
          relative or absolute paths. If any are present, they will be
          added as implicit dependencies to the targets built with that
          construction environment. The first argument in the command line
          will be searched for using the PATH variable in the ENV
          dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the
          command. The other arguments will only be found if they are
          absolute paths or valid paths relative to the working directory.

          If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to "all", then all
          arguments in the command line will be scanned for relative or
          absolute paths. If any are present, they will be added as
          implicit dependencies to the targets built with that
          construction environment. The first argument in the command line
          will be searched for using the PATH variable in the ENV
          dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the
          command. The other arguments will only be found if they are
          absolute paths or valid paths relative to the working directory.

env = Environment(IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES=False)

   INCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be prepended to each directory
          in the [781]$CPPPATH and [782]$FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the [783]$_CPPINCFLAGS and [784]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS
          variables are automatically generated.

   INCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to each directory
          in the [785]$CPPPATH and [786]$FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the [787]$_CPPINCFLAGS and [788]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS
          variables are automatically generated.

   INSTALL
          A function to be called to install a file into a destination
          file name. The default function copies the file into the
          destination (and sets the destination file's mode and permission
          bits to match the source file's). The function takes the
          following arguments:

def install(dest, source, env):

          dest is the path name of the destination file. source is the
          path name of the source file. env is the construction
          environment (a dictionary of construction values) in force for
          this file installation.

   INSTALLSTR
          The string displayed when a file is installed into a destination
          file name. The default is:

Install file: "$SOURCE" as "$TARGET"

   INTEL_C_COMPILER_VERSION
          Set by the [789]intelc Tool to the major version number of the
          Intel C compiler selected for use.

   JAR
          The Java archive tool.

   JARCHDIR
          The directory to which the Java archive tool should change
          (using the -C option).

   JARCOM
          The command line used to call the Java archive tool.

   JARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when the Java archive tool is called If
          this is not set, then [790]$JARCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

env = Environment(JARCOMSTR="JARchiving $SOURCES into $TARGET")

   JARFLAGS
          General options passed to the Java archive tool. By default this
          is set to cf to create the necessary jar file.

   JARSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java archives: .jar by default.

   JAVABOOTCLASSPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be added to the
          javac command line via the -bootclasspath option. The individual
          directory names will be separated by the operating system's path
          separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on Windows).

   JAVAC
          The Java compiler.

   JAVACCOM
          The command line used to compile a directory tree containing
          Java source files to corresponding Java class files. Any options
          specified in the [791]$JAVACFLAGS construction variable are
          included on this command line.

   JAVACCOMSTR
          The string displayed when compiling a directory tree of Java
          source files to corresponding Java class files. If this is not
          set, then [792]$JAVACCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVACCOMSTR="Compiling class files $TARGETS from $SOURCES")

   JAVACFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the Java compiler.

   JAVACLASSDIR
          The directory in which Java class files may be found. This is
          stripped from the beginning of any Java .class file names
          supplied to the JavaH builder.

   JAVACLASSPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for Java
          .class file. The directories in this list will be added to the
          javac and javah command lines via the -classpath option. The
          individual directory names will be separated by the operating
          system's path separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on
          Windows).

   JAVACLASSSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java class files; .class by default.

   JAVAH
          The Java generator for C header and stub files.

   JAVAHCOM
          The command line used to generate C header and stub files from
          Java classes. Any options specified in the [793]$JAVAHFLAGS
          construction variable are included on this command line.

   JAVAHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when C header and stub files are generated
          from Java classes. If this is not set, then [794]$JAVAHCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVAHCOMSTR="Generating header/stub file(s) $TARGETS from $SOU
RCES")

   JAVAHFLAGS
          General options passed to the C header and stub file generator
          for Java classes.

   JAVAINCLUDES
          Include path for Java header files (such as jni.h)

   JAVASOURCEPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for
          input .java file. The directories in this list will be added to
          the javac command line via the -sourcepath option. The
          individual directory names will be separated by the operating
          system's path separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on
          Windows).

          Note that this currently just adds the specified directory via
          the -sourcepath option. SCons does not currently search the
          $JAVASOURCEPATH directories for dependency .java files.

   JAVASUFFIX
          The suffix for Java files; .java by default.

   JAVAVERSION
          Specifies the Java version being used by the [795]Java builder.
          Set this to specify the version of Java targeted by the javac
          compiler. This is sometimes necessary because Java 1.5 changed
          the file names that are created for nested anonymous inner
          classes, which can cause a mismatch with the files that SCons
          expects will be generated by the javac compiler. Setting
          $JAVAVERSION to a version greater than 1.4 makes SCons realize
          that a build with such a compiler is actually up to date. The
          default is 1.4.

          While this is not primarily intended for selecting one version
          of the Java compiler vs. another, it does have that effect on
          the Windows platform. A more precise approach is to set
          [796]$JAVAC (and related construction variables for related
          utilities) to the path to the specific Java compiler you want,
          if that is not the default compiler. On non-Windows platforms,
          the alternatives system may provide a way to adjust the default
          Java compiler without having to specify explicit paths.

   LATEX
          The LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   LATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter. If this is not set, then [797]$LATEXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LATEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES")

   LATEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXRETRIES
          The maximum number of times that LaTeX will be re-run if the
          .log generated by the [798]$LATEXCOM command indicates that
          there are undefined references. The default is to try to resolve
          undefined references by re-running LaTeX up to three times.

   LATEXSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for LaTeX
          implicit dependencies (\include or \import files). The default
          list is:

[".tex", ".ltx", ".latex"]

   LDMODULE
          The linker for building loadable modules. By default, this is
          the same as [799]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOM
          The command line for building loadable modules. On Mac OS X,
          this uses the [800]$LDMODULE, [801]$LDMODULEFLAGS and
          [802]$FRAMEWORKSFLAGS variables. On other systems, this is the
          same as [803]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when building loadable modules. If
          not set, then [804]$LDMODULECOM (the command line) is displayed.

   LDMODULEEMITTER
          Contains the emitter specification for the [805]LoadableModule
          builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general
          information on specifying emitters.

   LDMODULEFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker for building loadable
          modules.

   LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          Instructs the [806]LoadableModule builder to not automatically
          create symlinks for versioned modules. Defaults to
          $SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS

   LDMODULEPREFIX
          The prefix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          [807]$SHLIBPREFIX.

   _LDMODULESONAME
          A macro that automatically generates loadable module's SONAME
          based on $TARGET, $LDMODULEVERSION and $LDMODULESUFFIX. Used by
          [808]LoadableModule builder when the linker tool supports SONAME
          (e.g. [809]gnulink).

   LDMODULESUFFIX
          The suffix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          $SHLIBSUFFIX.

   LDMODULEVERSION
          When this construction variable is defined, a versioned loadable
          module is created by [810]LoadableModule builder. This activates
          the [811]$_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS and thus modifies the
          [812]$LDMODULECOM as required, adds the version number to the
          library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed.
          [813]$LDMODULEVERSION versions should exist in the same format
          as [814]$SHLIBVERSION.

   _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          This macro automatically introduces extra flags to
          [815]$LDMODULECOM when building versioned [816]LoadableModule
          (that is when [817]$LDMODULEVERSION is set).
          _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS usually adds [818]$SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and
          some extra dynamically generated options (such as
          -Wl,-soname=$_LDMODULESONAME). It is unused by plain
          (unversioned) loadable modules.

   LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          Extra flags added to [819]$LDMODULECOM when building versioned
          [820]LoadableModule. These flags are only used when
          [821]$LDMODULEVERSION is set.

   LEX
          The lexical analyzer generator.

   LEX_HEADER_FILE
          If supplied, generate a C header file with the name taken from
          this variable. Will be emitted as a --header-file= command-line
          option. Use this in preference to including --header-file= in
          [822]$LEXFLAGS directly.

   LEX_TABLES_FILE
          If supplied, write the lex tables to a file with the name taken
          from this variable. Will be emitted as a --tables-file=
          command-line option. Use this in preference to including
          --tables-file= in [823]$LEXFLAGS directly.

   LEXCOM
          The command line used to call the lexical analyzer generator to
          generate a source file.

   LEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          lexical analyzer generator. If this is not set, then
          [824]$LEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LEXCOMSTR="Lex'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   LEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the lexical analyzer generator. In
          addition to passing the value on during invocation, the [825]lex
          tool also examines this construction variable for options which
          cause additional output files to be generated, and adds those to
          the target list. Recognized for this purpose are GNU flex
          options --header-file= and --tables-file=; the output file is
          named by the option argument.

          Note that files specified by --header-file= and --tables-file=
          may not be properly handled by SCons in all situations. Consider
          using [826]$LEX_HEADER_FILE and [827]$LEX_TABLES_FILE instead.

   LEXUNISTD
          Used only on windows environments to set a lex flag to prevent
          'unistd.h' from being included. The default value is
          '--nounistd'.

   _LIBDIRFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for library. The value of $_LIBDIRFLAGS is created by
          respectively prepending and appending [828]$LIBDIRPREFIX and
          [829]$LIBDIRSUFFIX to each directory in [830]$LIBPATH.

   LIBDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be prepended to each directory in the
          [831]$LIBPATH construction variable when the [832]$_LIBDIRFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to each directory in the
          [833]$LIBPATH construction variable when the [834]$_LIBDIRFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBEMITTER
          Contains the emitter specification for the [835]StaticLibrary
          builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general
          information on specifying emitters.

   _LIBFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying libraries to be
          linked with the resulting target. The value of [836]$_LIBFLAGS
          is created by respectively prepending and appending
          [837]$LIBLINKPREFIX and [838]$LIBLINKSUFFIX to each filename in
          [839]$LIBS.

   LIBLINKPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be prepended to each library in the
          [840]$LIBS construction variable when the [841]$_LIBFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBLINKSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to each library in the
          [842]$LIBS construction variable when the [843]$_LIBFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBPATH
          The list of directories that will be searched for libraries
          specified by the [844]$LIBS construction variable. $LIBPATH
          should be a list of path strings, or a single string, not a
          pathname list joined by Python's os.sep. Do not put library
          search directives directly into $LINKFLAGS or $SHLINKFLAGS as
          the result will be non-portable.

          Note: directory names in $LIBPATH will be looked-up relative to
          the directory of the SConscript file when they are used in a
          command. To force scons to look-up a directory relative to the
          root of the source tree use the # prefix:

env = Environment(LIBPATH='#/libs')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the [845]Dir
          function:

libs = Dir('libs')
env = Environment(LIBPATH=libs)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [846]$_LIBDIRFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and
          appending the values of the [847]$LIBDIRPREFIX and
          [848]$LIBDIRSUFFIX construction variables to each directory in
          $LIBPATH. Any command lines you define that need the $LIBPATH
          directory list should include $_LIBDIRFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

   LIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBPREFIXES
          A list of all legal prefixes for library file names. When
          searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files
          with these prefixes, the base library name, and suffixes from
          the [849]$LIBSUFFIXES list.

   LIBS
          A list of one or more libraries that will be added to the link
          line for linking with any executable program, shared library, or
          loadable module created by the construction environment or
          override.

          String-valued library names should include only the library base
          names, without prefixes such as lib or suffixes such as .so or
          .dll. The library list will be added to command lines through
          the automatically-generated $_LIBFLAGS construction variable
          which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending
          the values of the $LIBLINKPREFIX and $LIBLINKSUFFIX construction
          variables to each library name in $LIBS. Library name strings
          should not include a path component, instead the compiler will
          be directed to look for libraries in the paths specified by
          [850]$LIBPATH.

          Any command lines you define that need the $LIBS library list
          should include $_LIBFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

          If you add a File object to the $LIBS list, the name of that
          file will be added to $_LIBFLAGS, and thus to the link line,
          as-is, without $LIBLINKPREFIX or $LIBLINKSUFFIX. For example:

env.Append(LIBS=File('/tmp/mylib.so'))

          In all cases, scons will add dependencies from the executable
          program to all the libraries in this list.

   LIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBSUFFIXES
          A list of all legal suffixes for library file names. When
          searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files
          with prefixes from the [851]$LIBPREFIXES list, the base library
          name, and these suffixes.

   LICENSE
          The abbreviated name, preferably the SPDX code, of the license
          under which this project is released (GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1,
          BSD-2-Clause etc.). See
          [852]http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical for a list
          of license names and SPDX codes.

          See the [853]Package builder.

   LINESEPARATOR
          The separator used by the [854]Substfile and [855]Textfile
          builders. This value is used between sources when constructing
          the target. It defaults to the current system line separator.

   LINGUAS_FILE
          The $LINGUAS_FILE defines file(s) containing list of additional
          linguas to be processed by [856]POInit, [857]POUpdate or
          [858]MOFiles builders. It also affects [859]Translate builder.
          If the variable contains a string, it defines name of the list
          file. The $LINGUAS_FILE may be a list of file names as well. If
          $LINGUAS_FILE is set to True (or non-zero numeric value), the
          list will be read from default file named LINGUAS.

   LINK
          The linker. See also [860]$SHLINK for linking shared objects.

          On POSIX systems (those using the [861]link tool), you should
          normally not change this value as it defaults to a "smart"
          linker tool which selects a compiler driver matching the type of
          source files in use. So for example, if you set [862]$CXX to a
          specific compiler name, and are compiling C++ sources, the
          smartlink function will automatically select the same compiler
          for linking.

   LINKCOM
          The command line used to link object files into an executable.
          See also [863]$SHLINKCOM for linking shared objects.

   LINKCOMSTR
          If set, the string displayed when object files are linked into
          an executable. If not set, then [864]$LINKCOM (the command line)
          is displayed. See also [865]$SHLINKCOMSTR. for linking shared
          objects.

env = Environment(LINKCOMSTR = "Linking $TARGET")

   LINKFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker. Note that this
          variable should not contain -l (or similar) options for linking
          with the libraries listed in [866]$LIBS, nor -L (or similar)
          library search path options that scons generates automatically
          from [867]$LIBPATH. See [868]$_LIBFLAGS above, for the variable
          that expands to library-link options, and [869]$_LIBDIRFLAGS
          above, for the variable that expands to library search path
          options. See also [870]$SHLINKFLAGS. for linking shared objects.

   M4
          The M4 macro preprocessor.

   M4COM
          The command line used to pass files through the M4 macro
          preprocessor.

   M4COMSTR
          The string displayed when a file is passed through the M4 macro
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [871]$M4COM (the command
          line) is displayed.

   M4FLAGS
          General options passed to the M4 macro preprocessor.

   MAKEINDEX
          The makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and
          the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   MAKEINDEXCOM
          The command line used to call the makeindex generator for the
          TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter.

   MAKEINDEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the makeindex generator for
          the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured
          formatter and typesetter. If this is not set, then
          [872]$MAKEINDEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   MAKEINDEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the makeindex generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   MAXLINELENGTH
          The maximum number of characters allowed on an external command
          line. On Win32 systems, link lines longer than this many
          characters are linked via a temporary file name.

   MIDL
          The Microsoft IDL compiler.

   MIDLCOM
          The command line used to pass files to the Microsoft IDL
          compiler.

   MIDLCOMSTR
          The string displayed when the Microsoft IDL compiler is called.
          If this is not set, then [873]$MIDLCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   MIDLFLAGS
          General options passed to the Microsoft IDL compiler.

          means ``print [880]$MSGFMTCOM''). See [881]msgfmt tool and
          [882]MOFiles builder.

   MSGFMTFLAGS
          Additional flags to msgfmt(1). See [883]msgfmt tool and
          [884]MOFiles builder.

   MSSDK_DIR
          The directory containing the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK
          or Windows SDK) to be used for compilation.

   MSSDK_VERSION
          The version string of the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK or
          Windows SDK) to be used for compilation. Supported versions
          include 6.1, 6.0A, 6.0, 2003R2 and 2003R1.

   MSVC_BATCH
          When set to any true value, specifies that SCons should batch
          compilation of object files when calling the Microsoft Visual
          C/C++ compiler. All compilations of source files from the same
          source directory that generate target files in a same output
          directory and were configured in SCons using the same
          construction environment will be built in a single call to the
          compiler. Only source files that have changed since their object
          files were built will be passed to each compiler invocation (via
          the [905]$CHANGED_SOURCES construction variable). Any
          compilations where the object (target) file base name (minus the
          .obj) does not match the source file base name will be compiled
          separately.

   MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY
          Specify the scons behavior when the Microsoft Visual C/C++
          compiler is not detected.

          The $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY specifies the scons behavior when no
          msvc versions are detected or when the requested msvc version is
          not detected.

          The valid values for $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY and the corresponding
          scons behavior are:

        'Error' or 'Exception'
                Raise an exception when no msvc versions are detected or
                when the requested msvc version is not detected.

        'Warning' or 'Warn'
                Issue a warning and continue when no msvc versions are
                detected or when the requested msvc version is not
                detected. Depending on usage, this could result in build
                failure(s).

        'Ignore' or 'Suppress'
                Take no action and continue when no msvc versions are
                detected or when the requested msvc version is not
                detected. Depending on usage, this could result in build
                failure(s).

          Note: in addition to the camel case values shown above, lower
          case and upper case values are accepted as well.

          The $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY is applied when any of the following
          conditions are satisfied:

          + $MSVC_VERSION is specified, the default tools list is
            implicitly defined (i.e., the tools list is not specified),
            and the default tools list contains one or more of the msvc
            tools.
          + $MSVC_VERSION is specified, the default tools list is
            explicitly specified (e.g., tools=['default']), and the
            default tools list contains one or more of the msvc tools.
          + A non-default tools list is specified that contains one or
            more of the msvc tools (e.g., tools=['msvc', 'mslink']).

          The $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY is ignored when any of the following
          conditions are satisfied:

          + $MSVC_VERSION is not specified and the default tools list is
            implicitly defined (i.e., the tools list is not specified).
          + $MSVC_VERSION is not specified and the default tools list is
            explicitly specified (e.g., tools=['default']).
          + A non-default tool list is specified that does not contain any
            of the msvc tools (e.g., tools=['mingw']).

          Important usage details:

          + $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY must be passed as an argument to the
            [906]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
            [907]msvc, [908]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools
            list or via a tools list passed to the [909]Environment
            constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY must be set
            before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.

          When $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY is not specified, the default scons
          behavior is to issue a warning and continue subject to the
          conditions listed above. The default scons behavior may change
          in the future.

   MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS
          Pass user-defined arguments to the Visual C++ batch file
          determined via autodetection.

          $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS is available for msvc batch file arguments
          that do not have first-class support via construction variables
          or when there is an issue with the appropriate construction
          variable validation. When available, it is recommended to use
          the appropriate construction variables (e.g.,
          [910]$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION) rather than $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS
          arguments.

          The valid values for $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are: None, a string, or a
          list of strings.

          The $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS value is converted to a scalar string
          (i.e., "flattened"). The resulting scalar string, if not empty,
          is passed as an argument to the msvc batch file determined via
          autodetection subject to the validation conditions listed below.

          $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS is ignored when the value is None and when the
          result from argument conversion is an empty string. The
          validation conditions below do not apply.

          An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are
          satisfied:

          + $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS is specified for Visual Studio 2013 and
            earlier.
          + Multiple SDK version arguments (e.g., '10.0.20348.0') are
            specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.
          + [911]$MSVC_SDK_VERSION is specified and an SDK version
            argument (e.g., '10.0.20348.0') is specified in
            $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple SDK version declarations via
            [912]$MSVC_SDK_VERSION and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.
          + Multiple toolset version arguments (e.g., '-vcvars_ver=14.29')
            are specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.
          + [913]$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified and a toolset version
            argument (e.g., '-vcvars_ver=14.29') is specified in
            $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple toolset version declarations via
            [914]$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not
            allowed.
          + Multiple spectre library arguments (e.g.,
            '-vcvars_spectre_libs=spectre') are specified in
            $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.
          + [915]$MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled and a spectre library
            argument (e.g., '-vcvars_spectre_libs=spectre') is specified
            in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple spectre library declarations
            via [916]$MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not
            allowed.
          + Multiple UWP arguments (e.g., uwp or store) are specified in
            $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.
          + [917]$MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled and a UWP argument (e.g., uwp or
            store) is specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple UWP
            declarations via [918]$MSVC_UWP_APP and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are
            not allowed.

          Example 1 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with an SDK version and a
          toolset version specified with a string argument:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS='10.0.20348.0 -vcvars_ve
r=14.29.30133')

          Example 2 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with an SDK version and a
          toolset version specified with a list argument:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS=['10.0.20348.0', '-vcvar
s_ver=14.29.30133'])

          Important usage details:

          + $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS must be passed as an argument to the
            [919]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
            [920]msvc, [921]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools
            list or via a tools list passed to the [922]Environment
            constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS must be set before
            the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.
          + Other than checking for multiple declarations as described
            above, $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS arguments are not validated.
          + Erroneous, inconsistent, and/or version incompatible
            $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS arguments are likely to result in build
            failures for reasons that are not readily apparent and may be
            difficult to diagnose. The burden is on the user to ensure
            that the arguments provided to the msvc batch file are valid,
            consistent and compatible with the version of msvc selected.

   MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY
          Specify the scons behavior when Microsoft Visual C/C++ batch
          file errors are detected.

          The $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY specifies the scons behavior when
          msvc batch file errors are detected. When
          $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY is not specified, the default scons
          behavior is to suppress msvc batch file error messages.

          The root cause of msvc build failures may be difficult to
          diagnose. In these situations, setting the scons behavior to
          issue a warning when msvc batch file errors are detected may
          produce additional diagnostic information.

          The valid values for $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY and the
          corresponding scons behavior are:

        'Error' or 'Exception'
                Raise an exception when msvc batch file errors are
                detected.

        'Warning' or 'Warn'
                Issue a warning when msvc batch file errors are detected.

        'Ignore' or 'Suppress'
                Suppress msvc batch file error messages.

          Note: in addition to the camel case values shown above, lower
          case and upper case values are accepted as well.

          Example 1 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with user-defined script
          arguments:

env = environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS=['8.1', 'store', '-vcvar
s_ver=14.1'])
env.Program('hello', ['hello.c'], CCFLAGS='/MD', LIBS=['kernel32', 'user32', 'ru
ntimeobject'])

          Example 1 - Output fragment:

...
link /nologo /OUT:_build001\hello.exe kernel32.lib user32.lib runtimeobject.lib
_build001\hello.obj
LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'MSVCRT.lib'
...

          Example 2 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with user-defined script
          arguments and the script error policy set to issue a warning
          when msvc batch file errors are detected:

env = environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS=['8.1', 'store', '-vcvar
s_ver=14.1'], MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY='warn')
env.Program('hello', ['hello.c'], CCFLAGS='/MD', LIBS=['kernel32', 'user32', 'ru
ntimeobject'])

          Example 2 - Output fragment:

...

          Important usage details:

          + $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY must be passed as an argument to the
            [923]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
            [924]msvc, [925]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools
            list or via a tools list passed to the [926]Environment
            constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY must be set
            before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.
          + Due to scons implementation details, not all Windows system
            environment variables are propagated to the environment in
            which the msvc batch file is executed. Depending on Visual
            Studio version and installation options, non-fatal msvc batch
            file error messages may be generated for ancillary tools which
            may not affect builds with the msvc compiler. For this reason,
            caution is recommended when setting the script error policy to
            raise an exception (e.g., 'Error').

   MSVC_SDK_VERSION
          Build with a specific version of the Microsoft Software
          Development Kit (SDK).

          The valid values for $MSVC_SDK_VERSION are: None or a string
          containing the requested SDK version (e.g., '10.0.20348.0').

          $MSVC_SDK_VERSION is ignored when the value is None and when the
          value is an empty string. The validation conditions below do not
          apply.

          An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are
          satisfied:

          + $MSVC_SDK_VERSION is specified for Visual Studio 2013 and
            earlier.
          + $MSVC_SDK_VERSION is specified and an SDK version argument is
            specified in [927]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple SDK version
            declarations via $MSVC_SDK_VERSION and [928]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS
            are not allowed.
          + The $MSVC_SDK_VERSION specified does not match any of the
            supported formats:
               o '10.0.XXXXX.Y' [SDK 10.0]
               o '8.1' [SDK 8.1]
          + The system folder for the corresponding $MSVC_SDK_VERSION
            version is not found. The requested SDK version does not
            appear to be installed.
          + The $MSVC_SDK_VERSION version does not appear to support the
            requested platform type (i.e., UWP or Desktop). The requested
            SDK version platform type components do not appear to be
            installed.
          + The $MSVC_SDK_VERSION version is 8.1, the platform type is
            UWP, and the build tools selected are from Visual Studio 2017
            and later (i.e., [929]$MSVC_VERSION must be '14.0' or
            [930]$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION must be '14.0').

          Example 1 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with a specific Windows
          SDK version:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SDK_VERSION='10.0.20348.0')

          Example 2 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with a specific SDK
          version for the Universal Windows Platform:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SDK_VERSION='10.0.20348.0', MSVC_UWP
_APP=True)

          Important usage details:

          + $MSVC_SDK_VERSION must be passed as an argument to the
            [931]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
            [932]msvc, [933]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools
            list or via a tools list passed to the [934]Environment
            constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_SDK_VERSION must be set before
            the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.
          + Should a SDK 10.0 version be installed that does not follow
            the naming scheme above, the SDK version will need to be
            specified via [935]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS until the version number
            validation format can be extended.
          + Should an exception be raised indicating that the SDK version
            is not found, verify that the requested SDK version is
            installed with the necessary platform type components.
          + There is a known issue with the Microsoft libraries when the
            target architecture is ARM64 and a Windows 11 SDK (version
            '10.0.22000.0' and later) is used with the v141 build tools
            and older v142 toolsets (versions '14.28.29333' and earlier).
            Should build failures arise with these combinations of
            settings due to unresolved symbols in the Microsoft libraries,
            $MSVC_SDK_VERSION may be employed to specify a Windows 10 SDK
            (e.g., '10.0.20348.0') for the build.

   MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS
          Build with the spectre-mitigated Visual C++ libraries.

          The valid values for $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS are: True, False, or
          None.

          When $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled (i.e., True), the Visual C++
          environment will include the paths to the spectre-mitigated
          implementations of the Microsoft Visual C++ libraries.

          An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are
          satisfied:

          + $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled for Visual Studio 2015 and
            earlier.
          + $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled and a spectre library argument
            is specified in [936]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple spectre
            library declarations via $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS and
            [937]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.
          + $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled and the platform type is UWP.
            There are no spectre-mitigated libraries for Universal Windows
            Platform (UWP) applications or components.

          Example - A Visual Studio 2022 build with spectre mitigated
          Visual C++ libraries:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS=True)

          Important usage details:

          + $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS must be passed as an argument to the
            [938]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
            [939]msvc, [940]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools
            list or via a tools list passed to the [941]Environment
            constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS must be set before
            the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.
          + Additional compiler switches (e.g., /Qspectre) are necessary
            for including spectre mitigations when building user
            artifacts. Refer to the Visual Studio documentation for
            details.
          + The existence of the spectre libraries host architecture and
            target architecture folders are not verified when
            $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled which could result in build
            failures. The burden is on the user to ensure the requisite
            libraries with spectre mitigations are installed.

   MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION
          Build with a specific Visual C++ toolset version.

          Specifying $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION does not affect the
          autodetection and selection of msvc instances. The
          $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is applied after an msvc instance is
          selected. This could be the default version of msvc if
          [942]$MSVC_VERSION is not specified.

          The valid values for $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION are: None or a string
          containing the requested toolset version (e.g., '14.29').

          $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is ignored when the value is None and when
          the value is an empty string. The validation conditions below do
          not apply.

          An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are
          satisfied:

          + $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified for Visual Studio 2015 and
            earlier.
          + $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified and a toolset version
            argument is specified in [943]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple
            toolset version declarations via $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION and
            [944]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.
          + The $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION specified does not match any of the
            supported formats:
               o 'XX.Y'
               o 'XX.YY'
               o 'XX.YY.ZZZZZ'
               o 'XX.YY.Z' to 'XX.YY.ZZZZ' [scons extension not directly
                 supported by the msvc batch files and may be removed in
                 the future]
               o 'XX.YY.ZZ.N' [SxS format]
               o 'XX.YY.ZZ.NN' [SxS format]
          + The major msvc version prefix (i.e., 'XX.Y') of the
            $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION specified is for Visual Studio 2013 and
            earlier (e.g., '12.0').
          + The major msvc version prefix (i.e., 'XX.Y') of the
            $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION specified is greater than the msvc
            version selected (e.g., '99.0').
          + A system folder for the corresponding $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION
            version is not found. The requested toolset version does not
            appear to be installed.

          Toolset selection details:

          + When $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is not an SxS version number or a
            full toolset version number: the first toolset version, ranked
            in descending order, that matches the $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION
            prefix is selected.
          + When $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified using the major msvc
            version prefix (i.e., 'XX.Y') and the major msvc version is
            that of the latest release of Visual Studio, the selected
            toolset version may not be the same as the default Visual C++
            toolset version.
            In the latest release of Visual Studio, the default Visual C++
            toolset version is not necessarily the toolset with the
            largest version number.

          Example 1 - A default Visual Studio build with a partial toolset
          version specified:

env = Environment(MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.2')

          Example 2 - A default Visual Studio build with a partial toolset
          version specified:

env = Environment(MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.29')

          Example 3 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with a full toolset
          version specified:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.29.30133')

          Example 4 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with an SxS toolset
          version specified:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.29.16.11')

          Important usage details:

          + $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION must be passed as an argument to the
            [945]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
            [946]msvc, [947]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools
            list or via a tools list passed to the [948]Environment
            constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION must be set
            before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.
          + The existence of the toolset host architecture and target
            architecture folders are not verified when
            $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified which could result in build
            failures. The burden is on the user to ensure the requisite
            toolset target architecture build tools are installed.

   MSVC_USE_SCRIPT
          Use a batch script to set up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

          If set to the name of a Visual Studio .bat file (e.g.
          vcvars.bat), SCons will run that batch file instead of the
          auto-detected one, and extract the relevant variables from the
          result (typically %INCLUDE%, %LIB%, and %PATH%) for supplying to
          the build. This can be useful to force the use of a compiler
          version that SCons does not detect. [949]$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS
          provides arguments passed to this script.

          Setting $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT to None bypasses the Visual Studio
          autodetection entirely; use this if you are running SCons in a
          Visual Studio cmd window and importing the shell's environment
          variables - that is, if you are sure everything is set correctly
          already and you don't want SCons to change anything.

          $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT ignores [950]$MSVC_VERSION and
          [951]$TARGET_ARCH.

   MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS
          Provides arguments passed to the script [952]$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT.

   MSVC_USE_SETTINGS
          Use a dictionary to set up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

          $MSVC_USE_SETTINGS is ignored when [953]$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT is
          defined and/or when $MSVC_USE_SETTINGS is set to None.

          The dictionary is used to populate the environment with the
          relevant variables (typically %INCLUDE%, %LIB%, and %PATH%) for
          supplying to the build. This can be useful to force the use of a
          compiler environment that SCons does not configure correctly.
          This is an alternative to manually configuring the environment
          when bypassing Visual Studio autodetection entirely by setting
          [954]$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT to None.

          Here is an example of configuring a build environment using the
          Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler included in the Microsoft SDK on
          a 64-bit host and building for a 64-bit architecture:

# Microsoft SDK 6.0 (MSVC 8.0): 64-bit host and 64-bit target
msvc_use_settings = {
    "PATH": [
        "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\VC\\Bin\\x64",

# Specifying MSVC_VERSION is recommended
env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='8.0', MSVC_USE_SETTINGS=msvc_use_settings)

          Important usage details:

          + $MSVC_USE_SETTINGS must be passed as an argument to the
            [955]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
            [956]msvc, [957]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools
            list or via a tools list passed to the [958]Environment
            constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_USE_SETTINGS must be set before
            the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.
          + The dictionary content requirements are based on the internal
            msvc implementation and therefore may change at any time. The
            burden is on the user to ensure the dictionary contents are
            minimally sufficient to ensure successful builds.

   MSVC_UWP_APP
          Build with the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application
          Visual C++ libraries.

          The valid values for $MSVC_UWP_APP are: True, '1', False, '0',
          or None.

          When $MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled (i.e., True or '1'), the Visual
          C++ environment will be set up to point to the Windows Store
          compatible libraries and Visual C++ runtimes. In doing so, any
          libraries that are built will be able to be used in a UWP App
          and published to the Windows Store.

          An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are
          satisfied:

          + $MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled for Visual Studio 2013 and earlier.
          + $MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled and a UWP argument is specified in
            [959]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple UWP declarations via
            $MSVC_UWP_APP and [960]$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.

          Example - A Visual Studio 2022 build for the Universal Windows
          Platform:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_UWP_APP=True)

          Important usage details:

          + $MSVC_UWP_APP must be passed as an argument to the
            [961]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
            [962]msvc, [963]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools
            list or via a tools list passed to the [964]Environment
            constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_UWP_APP must be set before the
            first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.
          + The existence of the UWP libraries is not verified when
            $MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled which could result in build failures.
            The burden is on the user to ensure the requisite UWP
            libraries are installed.

   MSVC_VERSION
          Sets the preferred version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ to use.

          If $MSVC_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the
          latest version of Visual C/C++ installed on your system. If the
          specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will
          fail.

          $MSVC_VERSION must be passed as an argument to the
          [965]Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g., [966]msvc,
          [967]msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a
          tools list passed to the [968]Environment constructor.
          Otherwise, $MSVC_VERSION must be set before the first msvc tool
          is loaded into the environment.

          Valid values for Windows are 14.3, 14.2, 14.1, 14.1Exp, 14.0,
          14.0Exp, 12.0, 12.0Exp, 11.0, 11.0Exp, 10.0, 10.0Exp, 9.0,
          9.0Exp, 8.0, 8.0Exp, 7.1, 7.0, and 6.0. Versions ending in Exp
          refer to "Express" or "Express for Desktop" editions.

   MSVS
          When the Microsoft Visual Studio tools are initialized, they set
          up this dictionary with the following keys:

        VERSION
                the version of MSVS being used (can be set via
                [969]$MSVS_VERSION)

        VERSIONS
                the available versions of MSVS installed

        VCINSTALLDIR
                installed directory of Visual C++

        VSINSTALLDIR
                installed directory of Visual Studio

        FRAMEWORKDIR
                installed directory of the .NET framework

        FRAMEWORKVERSIONS
                list of installed versions of the .NET framework, sorted
                latest to oldest.

        FRAMEWORKVERSION
                latest installed version of the .NET framework

        FRAMEWORKSDKDIR
                installed location of the .NET SDK.

        PLATFORMSDKDIR
                installed location of the Platform SDK.

        PLATFORMSDK_MODULES
                dictionary of installed Platform SDK modules, where the
                dictionary keys are keywords for the various modules, and
                the values are 2-tuples where the first is the release
                date, and the second is the version number.

          If a value is not set, it was not available in the registry.

   MSVS_ARCH
          Sets the architecture for which the generated project(s) should
          build.

          The default value is x86. amd64 is also supported by SCons for
          most Visual Studio versions. Since Visual Studio 2015 arm is
          supported, and since Visual Studio 2017 arm64 is supported.
          Trying to set $MSVS_ARCH to an architecture that's not supported
          for a given Visual Studio version will generate an error.

   MSVS_PROJECT_GUID
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          file as the value of the ProjectGUID attribute. There is no
          default value. If not defined, a new GUID is generated.

   MSVS_SCC_AUX_PATH
          The path name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccAuxPath attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. There is no
          default value.

   MSVS_SCC_CONNECTION_ROOT
          The root path of projects in your SCC workspace, i.e the path
          under which all project and solution files will be generated. It
          is used as a reference path from which the relative paths of the
          generated Microsoft Visual Studio project and solution files are
          computed. The relative project file path is placed as the value
          of the SccLocalPath attribute of the project file and as the
          values of the SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection[i]
          (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of projects in the
          solution) attributes of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl)
          section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. Similarly
          the relative solution file path is placed as the values of the
          SccLocalPath[i] (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of
          projects in the solution) attributes of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. This is used only if the MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER
          construction variable is also set. The default value is the
          current working directory.

   MSVS_SCC_PROJECT_NAME
          The project name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccProjectName attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. In this
          case the string is also placed in the SccProjectName0 attribute
          of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft
          Visual Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          file as the value of the SccProvider attribute. The string is
          also placed in the SccProvider0 attribute of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_VERSION
          Sets the preferred version of Microsoft Visual Studio to use.

          If $MSVS_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the
          latest version of Visual Studio installed on your system. So, if
          you have version 6 and version 7 (MSVS .NET) installed, it will
          prefer version 7. You can override this by specifying the
          MSVS_VERSION variable in the Environment initialization, setting
          it to the appropriate version ('6.0' or '7.0', for example). If
          the specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will
          fail.

          This is obsolete: use $MSVC_VERSION instead. If $MSVS_VERSION is
          set and $MSVC_VERSION is not, $MSVC_VERSION will be set
          automatically to $MSVS_VERSION. If both are set to different
          values, scons will raise an error.

   MSVSBUILDCOM
          The build command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified build targets.

   MSVSCLEANCOM
          The clean command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with the -c option to remove any specified targets.

   MSVSENCODING
          The encoding string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is encoding Windows-1252.

   MSVSPROJECTCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files.

   MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio project (DSP) files.
          The default value is .vcproj when using Visual Studio version
          7.x (.NET) or later version, and .dsp when using earlier
          versions of Visual Studio.

   MSVSREBUILDCOM
          The rebuild command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified rebuild targets.

   MSVSSCONS
          The SCons used in generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files. The default is the version of SCons being used to
          generate the project file.

   MSVSSCONSCOM
          The default SCons command used in generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project files.

   MSVSSCONSCRIPT
          The sconscript file (that is, SConstruct or SConscript file)
          that will be invoked by Visual Studio project files (through the
          [970]$MSVSSCONSCOM variable). The default is the same sconscript
          file that contains the call to MSVSProject to build the project
          file.

   MSVSSCONSFLAGS
          The SCons flags used in generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio solution
          files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio solution (DSW)
          files. The default value is .sln when using Visual Studio
          version 7.x (.NET), and .dsw when using earlier versions of
          Visual Studio.

   MT
          The program used on Windows systems to embed manifests into DLLs
          and EXEs. See also [971]$WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST.

   MTEXECOM
          The Windows command line used to embed manifests into
          executables. See also [972]$MTSHLIBCOM.

   MTFLAGS
          Flags passed to the [973]$MT manifest embedding program (Windows
          only).

   MTSHLIBCOM
          The Windows command line used to embed manifests into shared
          libraries (DLLs). See also [974]$MTEXECOM.

   MWCW_VERSION
          The version number of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C compiler to
          be used.

   MWCW_VERSIONS
          A list of installed versions of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C
          compiler on this system.

   NAME
          Specfies the name of the project to package.

          See the [975]Package builder.

   NINJA_ALIAS_NAME
          The name of the alias target which will cause SCons to create
          the ninja build file, and then (optionally) run ninja. The
          default value is generate-ninja.

   NINJA_CMD_ARGS
          A string which will pass arguments through SCons to the ninja
          command when scons executes ninja. Has no effect if
          $NINJA_DISABLE_AUTO_RUN is set.

          This value can also be passed on the command line:

scons NINJA_CMD_ARGS=-v
or
scons NINJA_CMD_ARGS="-v -j 3"

   NINJA_COMPDB_EXPAND
          Boolean value to instruct ninja to expand the command line
          arguments normally put into response files. If true, prevents
          unexpanded lines in the compilation database like "gcc
          @rsp_file" and instead yields expanded lines like "gcc -c -o
          myfile.o myfile.c -Ia -DXYZ".

          Ninja's compdb tool added the -x flag in Ninja V1.9.0

   NINJA_DEPFILE_PARSE_FORMAT
          Determines the type of format ninja should expect when parsing
          header include depfiles. Can be msvc, gcc, or clang. The msvc
          option corresponds to /showIncludes format, and gcc or clang
          correspond to -MMD -MF.

   NINJA_DIR
          The builddir value. Propagates directly into the generated ninja
          build file. From Ninja's docs: " A directory for some Ninja
          output files. ... (You can also store other build output in this
          directory.) " The default value is .ninja.

   NINJA_DISABLE_AUTO_RUN
          Boolean. Default: False. If true, SCons will not run ninja
          automatically after creating the ninja build file.

          If not explicitly set, this will be set to True if
          --disable_execute_ninja or SetOption('disable_execute_ninja',
          True) is seen.

   NINJA_ENV_VAR_CACHE
          A string that sets the environment for any environment variables
          that differ between the OS environment and the SCons execution
          environment.

          It will be compatible with the default shell of the operating
          system.

          If not explicitly set, SCons will generate this dynamically from
          the execution environment stored in the current construction
          environment (e.g. env['ENV']) where those values differ from the
          existing shell..

   NINJA_FILE_NAME
          The filename for the generated Ninja build file. The default is
          ninja.build.

   NINJA_FORCE_SCONS_BUILD
          If true, causes the build nodes to callback to scons instead of
          using ninja to build them. This is intended to be passed to the
          environment on the builder invocation. It is useful if you have
          a build node which does something which is not easily translated
          into ninja.

   NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_ALIAS_NAME
          A string matching the name of a user defined alias which
          represents a list of all generated sources. This will prevent
          the auto-detection of generated sources from
          $NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_SUFFIXES. Then all other source files
          will be made to depend on this in the ninja build file, forcing
          the generated sources to be built first.

   NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_SUFFIXES
          The list of source file suffixes which are generated by SCons
          build steps. All source files which match these suffixes will be
          added to the _generated_sources alias in the output ninja build
          file. Then all other source files will be made to depend on this
          in the ninja build file, forcing the generated sources to be
          built first.

   NINJA_MSVC_DEPS_PREFIX
          The msvc_deps_prefix string. Propagates directly into the
          generated ninja build file. From Ninja's docs: "defines the
          string which should be stripped from msvc's /showIncludes
          output"

   NINJA_POOL
          Set the ninja_pool for this or all targets in scope for this env
          var.

   NINJA_REGENERATE_DEPS
          A generator function used to create a ninja depfile which
          includes all the files which would require SCons to be invoked
          if they change. Or a list of said files.

   _NINJA_REGENERATE_DEPS_FUNC
          Internal value used to specify the function to call with
          argument env to generate the list of files which if changed
          would require the ninja build file to be regenerated.

   NINJA_SCONS_DAEMON_KEEP_ALIVE
          The number of seconds for the SCons deamon launched by ninja to
          stay alive. (Default: 180000)

   NINJA_SCONS_DAEMON_PORT
          The TCP/IP port for the SCons daemon to listen on. NOTE: You
          cannot use a port already being listened to on your build
          machine. (Default: random number between 10000,60000)

   NINJA_SYNTAX
          The path to a custom ninja_syntax.py file which is used in
          generation. The tool currently assumes you have ninja installed
          as a Python module and grabs the syntax file from that
          installation if $NINJA_SYNTAX is not explicitly set.

   no_import_lib
          When set to non-zero, suppresses creation of a corresponding
          Windows static import lib by the [976]SharedLibrary builder when
          used with MinGW, Microsoft Visual Studio or Metrowerks. This
          also suppresses creation of an export (.exp) file when using
          Microsoft Visual Studio.

   OBJPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) object file names.

   OBJSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) object file names.

   PACKAGEROOT
          Specifies the directory where all files in resulting archive
          will be placed if applicable. The default value is
          "$NAME-$VERSION".

          See the [977]Package builder.

   PACKAGETYPE
          Selects the package type to build when using the [978]Package
          builder. May be a string or list of strings. See the
          docuentation for the builder for the currently supported types.

          $PACKAGETYPE may be overridden with the --package-type command
          line option.

          See the [979]Package builder.

   PACKAGEVERSION
          The version of the package (not the underlying project). This is
          currently only used by the rpm packager and should reflect
          changes in the packaging, not the underlying project code
          itself.

          See the [980]Package builder.

   PCH
          The Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header that will be used
          when compiling object files. This variable is ignored by tools
          other than Microsoft Visual C++. When this variable is defined
          SCons will add options to the compiler command line to cause it
          to use the precompiled header, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PCH file. Example:

env['PCH'] = File('StdAfx.pch')

   PCHCOM
          The command line used by the [981]PCH builder to generated a
          precompiled header.

   PCHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a precompiled header. If
          this is not set, then [982]$PCHCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   PCHPDBFLAGS
          A construction variable that, when expanded, adds the /yD flag
          to the command line only if the [983]$PDB construction variable
          is set.

   PCHSTOP
          This variable specifies how much of a source file is
          precompiled. This variable is ignored by tools other than
          Microsoft Visual C++, or when the PCH variable is not being
          used. When this variable is define it must be a string that is
          the name of the header that is included at the end of the
          precompiled portion of the source files, or the empty string if
          the "#pragma hrdstop" construct is being used:

env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'

   PDB
          The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging
          information for object files, shared libraries, and programs.
          This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual
          C++. When this variable is defined SCons will add options to the
          compiler and linker command line to cause them to generate
          external debugging information, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PDB file. Example:

env['PDB'] = 'hello.pdb'

          The Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default to
          generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with
          parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in
          the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single
          PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only
          way to get debug information embedded into a static library.
          Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance,
          although parallel builds will no longer work. You can generate
          PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the default
          [984]$CCPDBFLAGS variable; see the entry for that variable for
          specific examples.

   PDFLATEX
          The pdflatex utility.

   PDFLATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the pdflatex utility.

   PDFTEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the pdftex utility.

   PKGCHK
          On Solaris systems, the package-checking program that will be
          used (along with $PKGINFO) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is /usr/sbin/pgkchk.

   PKGINFO
          On Solaris systems, the package information program that will be
          used (along with $PKGCHK) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is pkginfo.

   PLATFORM
          The name of the platform used to create this construction
          environment. SCons sets this when initializing the platform,
          which by default is auto-detected (see the platform argument to
          [987]Environment).

env = Environment(tools=[])
if env['PLATFORM'] == 'cygwin':
    Tool('mingw')(env)
else:
    Tool('msvc')(env)

   POAUTOINIT
          The $POAUTOINIT variable, if set to True (on non-zero numeric
          value), let the [988]msginit tool to automatically initialize
          missing PO files with msginit(1). This applies to both,
          [989]POInit and [990]POUpdate builders (and others that use any
          of them).

   POCREATE_ALIAS
          Common alias for all PO files created with POInit builder
          (default: 'po-create'). See [991]msginit tool and [992]POInit
          builder.

   POSUFFIX
          Suffix used for PO files (default: '.po') See [993]msginit tool
          and [994]POInit builder.

   POTDOMAIN
          The $POTDOMAIN defines default domain, used to generate POT
          filename as $POTDOMAIN.pot when no POT file name is provided by
          the user. This applies to [995]POTUpdate, [996]POInit and
          [997]POUpdate builders (and builders, that use them, e.g.
          Translate). Normally (if $POTDOMAIN is not defined), the
          builders use messages.pot as default POT file name.

   POTSUFFIX
          Suffix used for PO Template files (default: '.pot'). See
          [998]xgettext tool and [999]POTUpdate builder.

   POTUPDATE_ALIAS
          Name of the common phony target for all PO Templates created
          with [1000]POUpdate (default: 'pot-update'). See [1001]xgettext
          tool and [1002]POTUpdate builder.

   POUPDATE_ALIAS
          Common alias for all PO files being defined with [1003]POUpdate
          builder (default: 'po-update'). See [1004]msgmerge tool and
          [1005]POUpdate builder.

   PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC
          A Python function used to print the command lines as they are
          executed (assuming command printing is not disabled by the -q or
          -s options or their equivalents). The function must accept four
          arguments: s, target, source and env. s is a string showing the
          command being executed, target, is the target being built (file
          node, list, or string name(s)), source, is the source(s) used
          (file node, list, or string name(s)), and env is the environment
          being used.

          The function must do the printing itself. The default
          implementation, used if this variable is not set or is None, is
          to just print the string, as in:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
    sys.stdout.write(s + "\n")

          Here is an example of a more interesting function:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
    sys.stdout.write(
        "Building %s -> %s...\n"
        % (
            ' and '.join([str(x) for x in source]),
            ' and '.join([str(x) for x in target]),
        )
    )

env = Environment(PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC=print_cmd_line)
env.Program('foo', ['foo.c', 'bar.c'])

          This prints:

...
scons: Building targets ...
Building bar.c -> bar.o...
Building foo.c -> foo.o...
Building foo.o and bar.o -> foo...
scons: done building targets.

          Another example could be a function that logs the actual
          commands to a file.

om $SOURCES")

   RMICFLAGS
          General options passed to the Java RMI stub compiler.

   RPATH
          A list of paths to search for shared libraries when running
          programs. Currently only used in the GNU (gnulink), IRIX
          (sgilink) and Sun (sunlink) linkers. Ignored on platforms and
          toolchains that don't support it. Note that the paths added to
          RPATH are not transformed by scons in any way: if you want an
          absolute path, you must make it absolute yourself.

   _RPATH
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          rpath flags to be used when linking a program with shared
          libraries. The value of $_RPATH is created by respectively
          prepending $RPATHPREFIX and appending $RPATHSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each directory in $RPATH.

   RPATHPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared
          libraries when running programs. This will be prepended to the

   RPCGEN
          The RPC protocol compiler.

   RPCGENCLIENTFLAGS
          Options passed to the RPC protocol compiler when generating

   RPCGENSERVICEFLAGS
          Options passed to the RPC protocol compiler when generating
          server side stubs. These are in addition to any flags specified
          in the [1040]$RPCGENFLAGS construction variable.

   RPCGENXDRFLAGS
          Options passed to the RPC protocol compiler when generating XDR
          routines. These are in addition to any flags specified in the
          [1041]$RPCGENFLAGS construction variable.

   SCANNERS
          A list of the available implicit dependency scanners. New file
          scanners may be added by appending to this list, although the
          more flexible approach is to associate scanners with a specific
          Builder. See the manpage sections "Builder Objects" and "Scanner
          Objects" for more information.

   SCONS_HOME
          The (optional) path to the SCons library directory, initialized
          from the external environment. If set, this is used to construct
          a shorter and more efficient search path in the [1042]$MSVSSCONS
          command line executed from Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files.

   SHCC
          The C compiler used for generating shared-library objects. See

          functions will initially be passed a reference of the current
          execution environment (e.g. env['ENV']), and each called while
          iterating the list. Each function must return a dictionary which
          will then be passed to the next function iterated. The return
          dictionary should contain keys which represent the environment
          variables and their respective values. This primary purpose of
          this construction variable is to give the user the ability to
          substitute execution environment variables based on env,
          targets, and sources. If desired, the user can completely
          customize the execution environment for particular targets.

env["SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS"] = [custom_shell_env]

          env The SCons construction environment from which the execution
          environment can be derived from.

          target The list of targets associated with this action.

          source The list of sources associated with this action.

          shell_env The current shell_env after iterating other
          SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS functions. This can be compared to the
          passed env['ENV'] to detect any changes.

   SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          Instructs the [1153]SharedLibrary builder to not create symlinks
          for versioned shared libraries.

   SHLIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for shared library file names.

   _SHLIBSONAME
          A macro that automatically generates shared library's SONAME
          based on $TARGET, $SHLIBVERSION and $SHLIBSUFFIX. Used by
          [1154]SharedLibrary builder when the linker tool supports SONAME
          (e.g. [1155]gnulink).

   SHLIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for shared library file names.

   SHLIBVERSION
          When this construction variable is defined, a versioned shared
          library is created by the [1156]SharedLibrary builder. This
          activates the [1157]$_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and thus modifies the
          [1158]$SHLINKCOM as required, adds the version number to the
          library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed.
          [1159]$SHLIBVERSION versions should exist as alpha-numeric,
          decimal-delimited values as defined by the regular expression
          "\w+[\.\w+]*". Example [1160]$SHLIBVERSION values include '1',
          '1.2.3', and '1.2.gitaa412c8b'.

   _SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          This macro automatically introduces extra flags to
          [1161]$SHLINKCOM when building versioned [1162]SharedLibrary
          (that is when [1163]$SHLIBVERSION is set). _SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          usually adds [1164]$SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and some extra dynamically
          generated options (such as -Wl,-soname=$_SHLIBSONAME. It is
          unused by "plain" (unversioned) shared libraries.

   SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          Extra flags added to [1165]$SHLINKCOM when building versioned
          [1166]SharedLibrary. These flags are only used when
          [1167]$SHLIBVERSION is set.

   SHLINK
          The linker for programs that use shared libraries. See also
          [1168]$LINK for linking static objects.

          On POSIX systems (those using the [1169]link tool), you should
          normally not change this value as it defaults to a "smart"
          linker tool which selects a compiler driver matching the type of
          source files in use. So for example, if you set [1170]$SHCXX to
          a specific compiler name, and are compiling C++ sources, the
          smartlink function will automatically select the same compiler
          for linking.

   SHLINKCOM
          The command line used to link programs using shared libraries.
          See also [1171]$LINKCOM for linking static objects.

   SHLINKCOMSTR
          The string displayed when programs using shared libraries are
          linked. If this is not set, then [1172]$SHLINKCOM (the command
          line) is displayed. See also [1173]$LINKCOMSTR for linking
          static objects.

env = Environment(SHLINKCOMSTR = "Linking shared $TARGET")

   SHLINKFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker for programs using
          shared libraries. Note that this variable should not contain -l
          (or similar) options for linking with the libraries listed in
          [1174]$LIBS, nor -L (or similar) include search path options
          that scons generates automatically from [1175]$LIBPATH. See
          [1176]$_LIBFLAGS above, for the variable that expands to
          library-link options, and [1177]$_LIBDIRFLAGS above, for the
          variable that expands to library search path options. See also
          [1178]$LINKFLAGS for linking static objects.

   SHOBJPREFIX
          The prefix used for shared object file names.

   SHOBJSUFFIX
          The suffix used for shared object file names.

   SONAME
          Variable used to hard-code SONAME for versioned shared
          library/loadable module.

env.SharedLibrary('test', 'test.c', SHLIBVERSION='0.1.2', SONAME='libtest.so.2')

          The variable is used, for example, by [1179]gnulink linker tool.

   SOURCE
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   SOURCE_URL
          The URL (web address) of the location from which the project was
          retrieved. This is used to fill in the Source: field in the
          controlling information for Ipkg and RPM packages.

          See the [1180]Package builder.

   SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   SOVERSION
          This will construct the SONAME using on the base library name
          (test in the example below) and use specified SOVERSION to
          create SONAME.

env.SharedLibrary('test', 'test.c', SHLIBVERSION='0.1.2', SOVERSION='2')

          The variable is used, for example, by [1181]gnulink linker tool.

          In the example above SONAME would be libtest.so.2 which would be
          a symlink and point to libtest.so.0.1.2

   SPAWN
          A command interpreter function that will be called to execute
          command line strings. The function must accept five arguments:

def spawn(shell, escape, cmd, args, env):

          shell is a string naming the shell program to use, escape is a
          function that can be called to escape shell special characters
          in the command line, cmd is the path to the command to be
          executed, args holds the arguments to the command and env is a
          dictionary of environment variables defining the execution
          environment in which the command should be executed.

   STATIC_AND_SHARED_OBJECTS_ARE_THE_SAME
          When this variable is true, static objects and shared objects
          are assumed to be the same; that is, SCons does not check for
          linking static objects into a shared library.

   SUBST_DICT
          The dictionary used by the [1182]Substfile or [1183]Textfile
          builders for substitution values. It can be anything acceptable
          to the dict() constructor, so in addition to a dictionary, lists
          of tuples are also acceptable.

   SUBSTFILEPREFIX
          The prefix used for [1184]Substfile file names, an empty string
          by default.

   SUBSTFILESUFFIX
          The suffix used for [1185]Substfile file names, an empty string
          by default.

   SUMMARY
          A short summary of what the project is about. This is used to
          fill in the Summary: field in the controlling information for
          Ipkg and RPM packages, and as the Description: field in MSI
          packages.

          See the [1186]Package builder.

   SWIG
          The name of the SWIG compiler to use.

   SWIGCFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C source files
          generated by SWIG. The default value is '_wrap$CFILESUFFIX' -
          that is, the concatenation of the string _wrap and the current C
          suffix [1187]$CFILESUFFIX. By default, this value is used
          whenever the -c++ option is not specified as part of the
          [1188]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGCOM
          The command line used to call SWIG.

   SWIGCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling SWIG. If this is not set, then
          [1189]$SWIGCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   SWIGCXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ source files
          generated by SWIG. The default value is '_wrap$CXXFILESUFFIX' -
          that is, the concatenation of the string _wrap and the current
          C++ suffix [1190]$CXXFILESUFFIX. By default, this value is used
          whenever the -c++ option is specified as part of the
          [1191]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGDIRECTORSUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ header files
          generated by SWIG. These are only generated for C++ code when
          the SWIG 'directors' feature is turned on. The default value is
          _wrap.h.

   SWIGFLAGS
          General options passed to SWIG. This is where you should set the
          target language (-python, -perl5, -tcl, etc.) and whatever other
          options you want to specify to SWIG, such as the -c++ to
          generate C++ code instead of C Code.

   _SWIGINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          SWIG command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for included files. The value of $_SWIGINCFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending $SWIGINCPREFIX
          and $SWIGINCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $SWIGPATH.

   SWIGINCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be prepended to the beginning of each
          directory in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the
          $_SWIGINCFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGINCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each directory
          in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the $_SWIGINCFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGOUTDIR
          Specifies the output directory in which SWIG should place
          generated language-specific files. This will be used by SCons to
          identify the files that will be generated by the SWIG call, and
          translated into the swig -outdir option on the command line.

   SWIGPATH
          The list of directories that SWIG will search for included
          files. SCons' SWIG implicit dependency scanner will search these
          directories for include files. The default value is an empty
          list.

          Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in
          [1192]$SWIGFLAGS the result will be non-portable and the
          directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner.
          Note: directory names in [1193]$SWIGPATH will be looked-up
          relative to the SConscript directory when they are used in a
          command. To force scons to look-up a directory relative to the
          root of the source tree use a top-relative path (#):

env = Environment(SWIGPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(SWIGPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_SWIGINCFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending
          the values of the $SWIGINCPREFIX and $SWIGINCSUFFIX construction
          variables to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $SWIGPATH. Any command lines you define that need the SWIGPATH
          directory list should include $_SWIGINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(SWIGCOM="my_swig -o $TARGET $_SWIGINCFLAGS $SOURCES")

   SWIGVERSION
          The detected version string of the SWIG tool.

   TAR
          The tar archiver.

   TARCOM
          The command line used to call the tar archiver.

   TARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when archiving files using the tar
          archiver. If this is not set, then [1194]$TARCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   TARFLAGS
          General options passed to the tar archiver.

   TARGET
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   TARGET_ARCH
          The name of the hardware architecture that objects created using
          this construction environment should target. Can be set when
          creating a construction environment by passing as a keyword
          argument in the [1195]Environment call.

          On the win32 platform, if the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is
          available, [1196]msvc tool setup is done using [1197]$HOST_ARCH
          and $TARGET_ARCH. If a value is not specified, will be set to
          the same value as [1198]$HOST_ARCH. Changing the value after the
          environment is initialized will not cause the tool to be
          reinitialized. Compiled objects will be in the target
          architecture if the compilation system supports generating for
          that target. The latest compiler which can fulfill the
          requirement will be selected, unless a different version is
          directed by the value of the [1199]$MSVC_VERSION construction
          variable.

          On the win32/msvc combination, valid target arch values are x86,
          arm, i386 for 32-bit targets and amd64, arm64, x86_64 and ia64
          (Itanium) for 64-bit targets. For example, if you want to
          compile 64-bit binaries, you would set TARGET_ARCH='x86_64' when
          creating the construction environment. Note that not all target
          architectures are supported for all Visual Studio / MSVC
          versions. Check the relevant Microsoft documentation.

          $TARGET_ARCH is not currently used by other compilation tools,
          but the option is reserved to do so in future

   TARGET_OS
          The name of the operating system that objects created using this
          construction environment should target. Can be set when creating
          a construction environment by passing as a keyword argument in
          the [1200]Environment call;.

          $TARGET_OS is not currently used by SCons but the option is
          reserved to do so in future

   TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   TARSUFFIX
          The suffix used for tar file names.

   TEMPFILE
          A callable object used to handle overly long command line
          strings, since operations which call out to a shell will fail if
          the line is longer than the shell can accept. This tends to
          particularly impact linking. The tempfile object stores the
          command line in a temporary file in the appropriate format, and
          returns an alternate command line so the invoked tool will make
          use of the contents of the temporary file. If you need to
          replace the default tempfile object, the callable should take
          into account the settings of [1201]$MAXLINELENGTH,
          [1202]$TEMPFILEPREFIX, [1203]$TEMPFILESUFFIX,
          [1204]$TEMPFILEARGJOIN, [1205]$TEMPFILEDIR and
          [1206]$TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC.

   TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC
          The default argument escape function is
          SCons.Subst.quote_spaces. If you need to apply extra operations
          on a command argument (to fix Windows slashes, normalize paths,
          etc.) before writing to the temporary file, you can set the
          $TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC variable to a custom function. Such a
          function takes a single string argument and returns a new string
          with any modifications applied. Example:

import sys
import re
from SCons.Subst import quote_spaces

WINPATHSEP_RE = re.compile(r"\\([^\"'\\]|$)")

def tempfile_arg_esc_func(arg):
    arg = quote_spaces(arg)
    if sys.platform != "win32":
        return arg
    # GCC requires double Windows slashes, let's use UNIX separator
    return WINPATHSEP_RE.sub(r"/\1", arg)

env["TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC"] = tempfile_arg_esc_func

   TEMPFILEARGJOIN
          The string to use to join the arguments passed to
          [1207]$TEMPFILE when the command line exceeds the limit set by
          [1208]$MAXLINELENGTH. The default value is a space. However for
          MSVC, MSLINK the default is a line separator as defined by
          os.linesep. Note this value is used literally and not expanded
          by the subst logic.

   TEMPFILEDIR
          The directory to create the long-lines temporary file in.

   TEMPFILEPREFIX
          The prefix for the name of the temporary file used to store
          command lines exceeding [1209]$MAXLINELENGTH. The default prefix
          is '@', which works for the Microsoft and GNU toolchains on
          Windows. Set this appropriately for other toolchains, for
          example '-@' for the diab compiler or '-via' for ARM toolchain.

   TEMPFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for the name of the temporary file used to store
          command lines exceeding [1210]$MAXLINELENGTH. The suffix should
          include the dot ('.') if one is wanted as it will not be added
          automatically. The default is .lnk.

   TEX
          The TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXCOM
          The command line used to call the TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the TeX formatter and
          typesetter. If this is not set, then [1211]$TEXCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

   TEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXINPUTS
          List of directories that the LaTeX program will search for
          include directories. The LaTeX implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for \include and \import files.

   TEXTFILEPREFIX
          The prefix used for [1212]Textfile file names, an empty string
          by default.

   TEXTFILESUFFIX
          The suffix used for [1213]Textfile file names; .txt by default.

   TOOLS
          A list of the names of the Tool specifications that are part of
          this construction environment.

   UNCHANGED_SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   UNCHANGED_TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   VENDOR
          The person or organization who supply the packaged software.
          This is used to fill in the Vendor: field in the controlling
          information for RPM packages, and the Manufacturer: field in the
          controlling information for MSI packages.

          See the [1214]Package builder.

   VERSION
          The version of the project, specified as a string.

          See the [1215]Package builder.

   VSWHERE
          Specify the location of vswhere.exe.

          The vswhere.exe executable is distributed with Microsoft Visual
          Studio and Build Tools since the 2017 edition, but is also
          available standalone. It provides full information about
          installations of 2017 and later editions. With the -legacy
          argument, vswhere.exe can detect installations of the 2010
          through 2015 editions with limited data returned. If VSWHERE is
          set, SCons will use that location.

          Otherwise SCons will look in the following locations and set
          VSWHERE to the path of the first vswhere.exe located.

          + %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer
          + %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer
          + %ChocolateyInstall%\bin

          Note that VSWHERE must be set at the same time or prior to any
          of [1216]msvc, [1217]msvs , and/or [1218]mslink [1219]Tool being
          initialized. Either set it as follows

env = Environment(VSWHERE='c:/my/path/to/vswhere')

          or if your construction environment is created specifying an
          empty tools list (or a list of tools which omits all of default,
          msvs, msvc, and mslink), and also before [1220]env.Tool is
          called to ininitialize any of those tools:

    env = Environment(tools=[])
    env['VSWHERE'] = r'c:/my/vswhere/install/location/vswhere.exe'
    env.Tool('msvc')
    env.Tool('mslink')
    env.Tool('msvs')

   WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST
          Set to True to embed the compiler-generated manifest (normally
          ${TARGET}.manifest) into all Windows executables and DLLs built
          with this environment, as a resource during their link step.
          This is done using [1221]$MT and [1222]$MTEXECOM and
          [1223]$MTSHLIBCOM. See also [1224]$WINDOWS_INSERT_MANIFEST.

   WINDOWS_INSERT_DEF
          If set to true, a library build of a Windows shared library
          (.dll file) will include a reference to the corresponding
          module-definition file at the same time, if a module-definition
          file is not already listed as a build target. The name of the
          module-definition file will be constructed from the base name of
          the library and the construction variables
          [1225]$WINDOWSDEFSUFFIX and [1226]$WINDOWSDEFPREFIX. The default
          is to not add a module-definition file. The module-definition
          file is not created by this directive, and must be supplied by
          the developer.

   WINDOWS_INSERT_MANIFEST
          If set to true, scons will add the manifest file generated by
          Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 and later to the target list so SCons
          will be aware they were generated. In the case of an executable,
          the manifest file name is constructed using
          [1227]$WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTSUFFIX and
          [1228]$WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTPREFIX. In the case of a shared
          library, the manifest file name is constructed using
          [1229]$WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTSUFFIX and
          [1230]$WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTPREFIX. See also
          [1231]$WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST.

   WINDOWSDEFPREFIX
          The prefix used for a Windows linker module-definition file
          name. Defaults to empty.

   WINDOWSDEFSUFFIX

          to .exp.

   WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTPREFIX
          The prefix used for executable program manifest files generated
          by Microsoft Visual C/C++. Defaults to empty.

   WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTSUFFIX
          The suffix used for executable program manifest files generated
          by Microsoft Visual C/C++. Defaults to .manifest.

   WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTPREFIX
          The prefix used for shared library manifest files generated by
          Microsoft Visual C/C++. Defaults to empty.

   WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTSUFFIX
          The suffix used for shared library manifest files generated by
          Microsoft Visual C/C++. Defaults to .manifest.

   X_IPK_DEPENDS

          information for Ipkg packages.

          See the [1232]Package builder.

   X_IPK_DESCRIPTION
          This is used to fill in the Description: field in the
          controlling information for Ipkg packages. The default value is
          "$SUMMARY\n$DESCRIPTION"

   X_IPK_MAINTAINER
          This is used to fill in the Maintainer: field in the controlling
          information for Ipkg packages.

          See the [1233]Package builder.

   X_MSI_LICENSE_TEXT
          The text of the software license in RTF format. Carriage return
          characters will be replaced with the RTF equivalent \\par.

          See the [1234]Package builder.

   X_MSI_UPGRADE_CODE
          TODO

   X_RPM_AUTOREQPROV
          This is used to fill in the AutoReqProv: field in the RPM .spec
          file.

   X_RPM_BUILD
          internal, but overridable

   X_RPM_BUILDREQUIRES
          This is used to fill in the BuildRequires: field in the RPM
          .spec file. Note this should only be used on a host managed by
          rpm as the dependencies will not be resolvable at build time
          otherwise.

   X_RPM_BUILDROOT
          internal, but overridable

   X_RPM_CLEAN
          internal, but overridable

   X_RPM_CONFLICTS
          This is used to fill in the Conflicts: field in the RPM .spec
          file.

   X_RPM_DEFATTR
          This value is used as the default attributes for the files in
          the RPM package. The default value is "(-,root,root)".

   X_RPM_DISTRIBUTION
          This is used to fill in the Distribution: field in the RPM .spec
          file.

   X_RPM_EPOCH
          This is used to fill in the Epoch: field in the RPM .spec file.

   X_RPM_EXTRADEFS
          A list used to supply extra defintions or flags to be added to
          the RPM .spec file. Each item is added as-is with a carriage
          return appended. This is useful if some specific RPM feature not
          otherwise anticipated by SCons needs to be turned on or off.
          Note if this variable is omitted, SCons will by default supply
          the value '%global debug_package %{nil}' to disable debug
          package generation. To enable debug package generation, include
          this variable set either to None, or to a custom list that does
          not include the default line. Added in version 3.1.

env.Package(
    NAME="foo",
    ...
    X_RPM_EXTRADEFS=[
        "%define _unpackaged_files_terminate_build 0"

   XGETTEXT
          Path to xgettext(1) program (found via Detect()). See
          [1236]xgettext tool and [1237]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTCOM
          Complete xgettext command line. See [1238]xgettext tool and
          [1239]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTCOMSTR
          A string that is shown when xgettext(1) command is invoked
          (default: '', which means "print [1240]$XGETTEXTCOM"). See
          [1241]xgettext tool and [1242]POTUpdate builder.

   _XGETTEXTDOMAIN
          Internal "macro". Generates xgettext domain name form source and
          target (default: '${TARGET.filebase}').

   XGETTEXTFLAGS
          Additional flags to xgettext(1). See [1243]xgettext tool and
          [1244]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTFROM
          Name of file containing list of xgettext(1)'s source files.
          Autotools' users know this as POTFILES.in so they will in most
          cases set XGETTEXTFROM="POTFILES.in" here. The $XGETTEXTFROM
          files have same syntax and semantics as the well known GNU
          POTFILES.in. See [1245]xgettext tool and [1246]POTUpdate
          builder.

   _XGETTEXTFROMFLAGS
          Internal "macro". Genrates list of -D<dir> flags from the
          [1247]$XGETTEXTPATH list.

   XGETTEXTFROMPREFIX
          This flag is used to add single [1248]$XGETTEXTFROM file to
          xgettext(1)'s commandline (default: '-f').

   XGETTEXTFROMSUFFIX
          (default: '')

   XGETTEXTPATH
          List of directories, there xgettext(1) will look for source
          files (default: []).

Note

          This variable works only together with [1249]$XGETTEXTFROM

          See also [1250]xgettext tool and [1251]POTUpdate builder.

   _XGETTEXTPATHFLAGS
          Internal "macro". Generates list of -f<file> flags from
          [1252]$XGETTEXTFROM.

   XGETTEXTPATHPREFIX
          This flag is used to add single search path to xgettext(1)'s
          commandline (default: '-D').

   XGETTEXTPATHSUFFIX
          (default: '')

   YACC
          The parser generator.

   YACC_GRAPH_FILE
          If supplied, write a graph of the automaton to a file with the
          name taken from this variable. Will be emitted as a --graph=
          command-line option. Use this in preference to including
          --graph= in [1253]$YACCFLAGS directly.

   YACC_HEADER_FILE
          If supplied, generate a header file with the name taken from
          this variable. Will be emitted as a --header= command-line
          option. Use this in preference to including --header= in
          [1254]$YACCFLAGS directly.

   YACCCOM
          The command line used to call the parser generator to generate a
          source file.

   YACCCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          parser generator. If this is not set, then [1255]$YACCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(YACCCOMSTR="Yacc'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   YACCFLAGS
          General options passed to the parser generator. In addition to
          passing the value on during invocation, the [1256]yacc tool also
          examines this construction variable for options which cause
          additional output files to be generated, and adds those to the
          target list.

          If a -d option is present, scons assumes that the call will also
          create a header file with the suffix defined by
          [1257]$YACCHFILESUFFIX if the yacc source file ends in a .y
          suffix, or a file with the suffix defined by
          [1258]$YACCHXXFILESUFFIX if the yacc source file ends in a .yy
          suffix.

          If a -g option is present, scons assumes that the call will also
          create a graph file with the suffix defined by
          [1259]$YACCVCGFILESUFFIX.

          If a -v option is present, scons assumes that the call will also
          create an output debug file with the suffix .output.

          Also recognized are GNU bison options --header= and its
          deprecated synonym --defines=, which is similar to -d but the
          output filename is named by the option argument; and --graph=,
          which is similar to -g but the output filename is named by the
          option argument.

          Note that files specified by --header= and --graph= may not be
          properly handled by SCons in all situations. Consider using
          [1260]$YACC_HEADER_FILE and [1261]$YACC_GRAPH_FILE instead.

   YACCHFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option is used. Note that setting this
          variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          header file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .h.

   YACCHXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C++ header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option is used. Note that setting this
          variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          header file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .hpp, except on Mac OS X, where the
          default is ${TARGET.suffix}.h. because the default bison parser
          generator just appends .h to the name of the generated C++ file.

   YACCVCGFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the file containing the VCG grammar automaton
          definition when the --graph= option is used. Note that setting
          this variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          VCG file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .vcg.

   ZIP
          The zip compression and file packaging utility.

   ZIP_OVERRIDE_TIMESTAMP
          An optional timestamp which overrides the last modification time
          of the file when stored inside the Zip archive. This is a tuple
          of six values: Year (>= 1980) Month (one-based) Day of month
          (one-based) Hours (zero-based) Minutes (zero-based) Seconds
          (zero-based)

   ZIPCOM
          The command line used to call the zip utility, or the internal
          Python function used to create a zip archive.

   ZIPCOMPRESSION
          The compression flag from the Python zipfile module used by the
          internal Python function to control whether the zip archive is
          compressed or not. The default value is zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED,
          which creates a compressed zip archive. This value has no effect
          if the zipfile module is unavailable.

   ZIPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when archiving files using the zip utility.
          If this is not set, then [1262]$ZIPCOM (the command line or
          internal Python function) is displayed.

env = Environment(ZIPCOMSTR = "Zipping $TARGET")

   ZIPFLAGS
          General options passed to the zip utility.

   ZIPROOT
          An optional zip root directory (default empty). The filenames
          stored in the zip file will be relative to this directory, if
          given. Otherwise the filenames are relative to the current
          directory of the command. For instance:

env = Environment()
env.Zip('foo.zip', 'subdir1/subdir2/file1', ZIPROOT='subdir1')

          will produce a zip file foo.zip containing a file with the name
          subdir2/file1 rather than subdir1/subdir2/file1.

   ZIPSUFFIX
          The suffix used for zip file names.

Appendix B. Builders

   This appendix contains descriptions of all of the Builders that are
   potentially available "out of the box" in this version of SCons.

   CFile()
          env.CFile()
          Builds a C source file given a lex (.l) or yacc (.y) input file.
          The suffix specified by the [1263]$CFILESUFFIX construction
          variable (.c by default) is automatically added to the target if
          it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.c
env.CFile(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.l')
# builds bar.c
env.CFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.y')

   Command()
          env.Command()
          The Command "Builder" is actually a function that looks like a
          Builder, but takes a required third argument, which is the
          action to take to construct the target from the source, used for
          "one-off" builds where a full builder is not needed. Thus it
          does not follow the builder calling rules described at the start
          of this section. See instead the [1264]Command function
          description for the calling syntax and details.

   CompilationDatabase()
          env.CompilationDatabase()
          CompilationDatabase is a special builder which adds a target to
          create a JSON formatted compilation database compatible with
          clang tooling (see the [1265]LLVM specification). This database
          is suitable for consumption by various tools and editors who can
          use it to obtain build and dependency information which
          otherwise would be internal to SCons. The builder does not
          require any source files to be specified, rather it arranges to
          emit information about all of the C, C++ and assembler
          source/output pairs identified in the build that are not
          excluded by the optional filter
          [1266]$COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER. The target is subject to the
          usual SCons target selection rules.

          If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a
          target name of compile_commands.json.

          If called with a single positional argument, scons will "deduce"
          the target name from that source argument, giving it the same
          name, and then ignore the source. This is the usual way to call
          the builder if a non-default target name is wanted.

          If called with either the target= or source= keyword arguments,
          the value of the argument is taken as the target name. If called
          with both, the target= value is used and source= is ignored. If
          called with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored,
          since there is no way to deduce what the intent was; in this
          case the default target name will be used.

Note

          You must load the compilation_db tool prior to specifying any
          part of your build or some source/output files will not show up
          in the compilation database.

          Available since scons 4.0.

   CXXFile()
          env.CXXFile()
          Builds a C++ source file given a lex (.ll) or yacc (.yy) input
          file. The suffix specified by the [1267]$CXXFILESUFFIX
          construction variable (.cc by default) is automatically added to
          the target if it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'foo.cc', source = 'foo.ll')
# builds bar.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.yy')

   DocbookEpub()
          env.DocbookEpub()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for EPUB output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookEpub('manual.epub', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookEpub('manual')

   DocbookHtml()
          env.DocbookHtml()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual')

   DocbookHtmlChunked()
          env.DocbookHtmlChunked()
          A pseudo-Builder providing a Docbook toolchain for chunked HTML
          output. It supports the base.dir parameter. The chunkfast.xsl
          file (requires "EXSLT") is used as the default stylesheet. Basic
          syntax:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file.

          If you use the root.filename parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to specify the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You
          can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given
          prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookHtmlhelp()
          env.DocbookHtmlhelp()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTMLHELP
          output. Its basic syntax is:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file.

          If you use the root.filename parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to specify the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You
          can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given
          prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookMan()
          env.DocbookMan()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for Man page
          output. Its basic syntax is:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookMan('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file. Note, that you can specify a
          target name, but the actual output names are automatically set
          from the refname entries in your XML source.

   DocbookPdf()
          env.DocbookPdf()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookPdf('manual')

   DocbookSlidesHtml()
          env.DocbookSlidesHtml()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML slides
          output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual')

          If you use the titlefoil.html parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to give the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('mymanual.html','manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You
          can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given
          prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookSlidesPdf()
          env.DocbookSlidesPdf()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF slides
          output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual')

   DocbookXInclude()
          env.DocbookXInclude()
          A pseudo-Builder, for resolving XIncludes in a separate
          processing step.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookXInclude('manual_xincluded.xml', 'manual.xml')

   DocbookXslt()
          env.DocbookXslt()
          A pseudo-Builder, applying a given XSL transformation to the
          input file.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookXslt('manual_transformed.xml', 'manual.xml', xsl='transform.xslt')

          Note, that this builder requires the xsl parameter to be set.

   DVI()
          env.DVI()
          Builds a .dvi file from a .tex, .ltx or .latex input file. If
          the source file suffix is .tex, scons will examine the contents
          of the file; if the string \documentclass or \documentstyle is
          found, the file is assumed to be a LaTeX file and the target is
          built by invoking the [1268]$LATEXCOM command line; otherwise,
          the [1269]$TEXCOM command line is used. If the file is a LaTeX
          file, the DVI builder method will also examine the contents of
          the .aux file and invoke the [1270]$BIBTEX command line if the
          string bibdata is found, start [1271]$MAKEINDEX to generate an
          index if a .ind file is found and will examine the contents .log
          file and re-run the [1272]$LATEXCOM command if the log file says
          it is necessary.

          The suffix .dvi (hard-coded within TeX itself) is automatically
          added to the target if it is not already present. Examples:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.DVI(target = 'aaa.dvi', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.dvi
env.DVI(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.ltx')
# builds from ccc.latex
env.DVI(target = 'ccc.dvi', source = 'ccc.latex')

   Gs()
          env.Gs()
          A Builder for explicitly calling the gs executable. Depending on
          the underlying OS, the different names gs, gsos2 and gswin32c
          are tried.

env = Environment(tools=['gs'])
env.Gs(
    'cover.jpg',
    'scons-scons.pdf',
    GSFLAGS='-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=jpeg -dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=1 -q',
)

   Install()
          env.Install()
          Installs one or more source files or directories in the
          specified target, which must be a directory. The names of the
          specified source files or directories remain the same within the
          destination directory. The sources may be given as a string or
          as a node returned by a builder.

env.Install(target='/usr/local/bin', source=['foo', 'bar'])

          Note that if target paths chosen for the Install builder (and
          the related InstallAs and InstallVersionedLib builders) are
          outside the project tree, such as in the example above, they may
          not be selected for "building" by default, since in the absence
          of other instructions scons builds targets that are underneath
          the top directory (the directory that contains the SConstruct
          file, usually the current directory). Use command line targets
          or the Default function in this case.

          If the --install-sandbox command line option is given, the
          target directory will be prefixed by the directory path
          specified. This is useful to test installs without installing to
          a "live" location in the system.

          See also FindInstalledFiles. For more thoughts on installation,
          see the User Guide (particularly the section on Command-Line
          Targets and the chapters on Installing Files and on Alias
          Targets).

   InstallAs()
          env.InstallAs()
          Installs one or more source files or directories to specific
          names, allowing changing a file or directory name as part of the
          installation. It is an error if the target and source arguments
          list different numbers of files or directories.

env.InstallAs(target='/usr/local/bin/foo',
              source='foo_debug')
env.InstallAs(target=['../lib/libfoo.a', '../lib/libbar.a'],
              source=['libFOO.a', 'libBAR.a'])

          See the note under Install.

   InstallVersionedLib()
          env.InstallVersionedLib()
          Installs a versioned shared library. The symlinks appropriate to
          the architecture will be generated based on symlinks of the
          source library.

env.InstallVersionedLib(target='/usr/local/bin/foo',
                        source='libxyz.1.5.2.so')

          See the note under Install.

   Jar()
          env.Jar()
          Builds a Java archive (.jar) file from the specified list of
          sources. Any directories in the source list will be searched for
          .class files). Any .java files in the source list will be
          compiled to .class files by calling the [1273]Java Builder.

          If the [1274]$JARCHDIR value is set, the jar command will change
          to the specified directory using the -C option. If $JARCHDIR is
          not set explicitly, SCons will use the top of any subdirectory
          tree in which Java .class were built by the [1275]Java Builder.

          If the contents any of the source files begin with the string
          Manifest-Version, the file is assumed to be a manifest and is
          passed to the jar command with the m option set.

env.Jar(target = 'foo.jar', source = 'classes')

env.Jar(target = 'bar.jar',
        source = ['bar1.java', 'bar2.java'])

   Java()
          env.Java()
          Builds one or more Java class files. The sources may be any
          combination of explicit .java files, or directory trees which
          will be scanned for .java files.

          SCons will parse each source .java file to find the classes
          (including inner classes) defined within that file, and from
          that figure out the target .class files that will be created.
          The class files will be placed underneath the specified target
          directory.

          SCons will also search each Java file for the Java package name,
          which it assumes can be found on a line beginning with the
          string package in the first column; the resulting .class files
          will be placed in a directory reflecting the specified package
          name. For example, the file Foo.java defining a single public
          Foo class and containing a package name of sub.dir will generate
          a corresponding sub/dir/Foo.class class file.

          Examples:

env.Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['src1', 'src2'])
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['File1.java', 'File2.java'])

          Java source files can use the native encoding for the underlying
          OS. Since SCons compiles in simple ASCII mode by default, the
          compiler will generate warnings about unmappable characters,
          which may lead to errors as the file is processed further. In
          this case, the user must specify the LANG environment variable
          to tell the compiler what encoding is used. For portibility,
          it's best if the encoding is hard-coded so that the compile will
          work if it is done on a system with a different encoding.

env = Environment()
env['ENV']['LANG'] = 'en_GB.UTF-8'

   JavaH()
          env.JavaH()
          Builds C header and source files for implementing Java native
          methods. The target can be either a directory in which the
          header files will be written, or a header file name which will
          contain all of the definitions. The source can be the names of
          .class files, the names of .java files to be compiled into
          .class files by calling the [1276]Java builder method, or the
          objects returned from the Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [1277]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the JavaH builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

          Examples:

# builds java_native.h
classes = env.Java(target="classdir", source="src")
env.JavaH(target="java_native.h", source=classes)

# builds include/package_foo.h and include/package_bar.h
env.JavaH(target="include", source=["package/foo.class", "package/bar.class"])

# builds export/foo.h and export/bar.h
env.JavaH(
    target="export",
    source=["classes/foo.class", "classes/bar.class"],
    JAVACLASSDIR="classes",
)

Note

          Java versions starting with 10.0 no longer use the javah command
          for generating JNI headers/sources, and indeed have removed the
          command entirely (see Java Enhancement Proposal [1278]JEP 313),
          making this tool harder to use for that purpose. SCons may
          autodiscover a javah belonging to an older release if there are
          multiple Java versions on the system, which will lead to
          incorrect results. To use with a newer Java, override the
          default values of [1279]$JAVAH (to contain the path to the
          javac) and [1280]$JAVAHFLAGS (to contain at least a -h flag) and
          note that generating headers with javac requires supplying
          source .java files only, not .class files.

   Library()
          env.Library()
          A synonym for the StaticLibrary builder method.

   LoadableModule()
          env.LoadableModule()
          On most systems, this is the same as SharedLibrary. On Mac OS X
          (Darwin) platforms, this creates a loadable module bundle.

   M4()
          env.M4()
          Builds an output file from an M4 input file. This uses a default
          [1281]$M4FLAGS value of -E, which considers all warnings to be
          fatal and stops on the first warning when using the GNU version
          of m4. Example:

env.M4(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.c.m4')

   Moc()
          env.Moc()
          Builds an output file from a moc input file. moc input files are
          either header files or C++ files. This builder is only available
          after using the tool [1282]qt. See the [1283]$QTDIR variable for
          more information. Example:

env.Moc('foo.h')  # generates moc_foo.cc
env.Moc('foo.cpp')  # generates foo.moc

   MOFiles()
          env.MOFiles()
          This builder belongs to [1284]msgfmt tool. The builder compiles
          PO files to MO files.

          Example 1. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po:

  # ...
  env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'])

          Example 2. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

  # ...
  env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 3. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po
          plus files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

  # ...
  env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 4. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file
          (another version):

  # ...
  env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
  env.MOFiles()

   MSVSProject()
          env.MSVSProject()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio project file, and by default
          builds a solution file as well.

          This builds a Visual Studio project file, based on the version
          of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [1285]$MSVS_VERSION in the
          Environment constructor). For Visual Studio 6, it will generate
          a .dsp file. For Visual Studio 7, 8, and 9, it will generate a
          .vcproj file. For Visual Studio 10 and later, it will generate a
          .vcxproj file.

          By default, this also generates a solution file for the
          specified project, a .dsw file for Visual Studio 6 or a .sln
          file for Visual Studio 7 and later. This behavior may be
          disabled by specifying auto_build_solution=0 when you call
          MSVSProject, in which case you presumably want to build the
          solution file(s) by calling the MSVSSolution Builder (see
          below).

          The MSVSProject builder takes several lists of filenames to be
          placed into the project file. These are currently limited to
          srcs, incs, localincs, resources, and misc. These are pretty
          self-explanatory, but it should be noted that these lists are
          added to the [1286]$SOURCES construction variable as strings,
          NOT as SCons File Nodes. This is because they represent file
          names to be added to the project file, not the source files used
          to build the project file.

          The above filename lists are all optional, although at least one
          must be specified for the resulting project file to be
          non-empty.

          In addition to the above lists of values, the following values
          may be specified:

        target
                The name of the target .dsp or .vcproj file. The correct
                suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but
                the [1287]$MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX construction variable will be
                defined to the correct value (see example below).

        variant
                The name of this particular variant. For Visual Studio 7
                projects, this can also be a list of variant names. These
                are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really
                can be anything you want. For Visual Studio 7 projects,
                they may also specify a target platform separated from the
                variant name by a | (vertical pipe) character: Debug|Xbox.
                The default target platform is Win32. Multiple calls to
                MSVSProject with different variants are allowed; all
                variants will be added to the project file with their
                appropriate build targets and sources.

        cmdargs
                Additional command line arguments for the different
                variants. The number of cmdargs entries must match the
                number of variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If
                you give only one, it will automatically be propagated to
                all variants.

        cppdefines
                Preprocessor definitions for the different variants. The
                number of cppdefines entries must match the number of
                variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give
                only one, it will automatically be propagated to all
                variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use
                the invoking environment's CPPDEFINES entry for all
                variants.

        cppflags
                Compiler flags for the different variants. If a /std:c++
                flag is found then /Zc:__cplusplus is appended to the
                flags if not already found, this ensures that intellisense
                uses the /std:c++ switch. The number of cppflags entries
                must match the number of variant entries, or be empty (not
                specified). If you give only one, it will automatically be
                propagated to all variants. If you don't give this
                parameter, SCons will combine the invoking environment's
                CCFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, CPPFLAGS entries for all variants.

        cpppaths
                Compiler include paths for the different variants. The
                number of cpppaths entries must match the number of
                variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give
                only one, it will automatically be propagated to all
                variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use
                the invoking environment's CPPPATH entry for all variants.

        buildtarget
                An optional string, node, or list of strings or nodes (one
                per build variant), to tell the Visual Studio debugger
                what output target to use in what build variant. The
                number of buildtarget entries must match the number of
                variant entries.

        runfile
                The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later will
                run and debug. This appears as the value of the Output
                field in the resulting Visual Studio project file. If this
                is not specified, the default is the same as the specified
                buildtarget value.

          Note that because SCons always executes its build commands from
          the directory in which the SConstruct file is located, if you
          generate a project file in a different directory than the
          SConstruct directory, users will not be able to double-click on
          the file name in compilation error messages displayed in the
          Visual Studio console output window. This can be remedied by
          adding the Visual C/C++ /FC compiler option to the
          [1288]$CCFLAGS variable so that the compiler will print the full
          path name of any files that cause compilation errors.

          Example usage:

barsrcs = ['bar.cpp']
barincs = ['bar.h']
barlocalincs = ['StdAfx.h']
barresources = ['bar.rc','resource.h']
barmisc = ['bar_readme.txt']

dll = env.SharedLibrary(target='bar.dll',
                        source=barsrcs)
buildtarget = [s for s in dll if str(s).endswith('dll')]
env.MSVSProject(target='Bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX'],
                srcs=barsrcs,
                incs=barincs,
                localincs=barlocalincs,
                resources=barresources,
                misc=barmisc,
                buildtarget=buildtarget,
                variant='Release')

          Starting with version 2.4 of SCons it is also possible to
          specify the optional argument DebugSettings, which creates files
          for debugging under Visual Studio:

        DebugSettings
                A dictionary of debug settings that get written to the
                .vcproj.user or the .vcxproj.user file, depending on the
                version installed. As it is done for cmdargs (see above),
                you can specify a DebugSettings dictionary per variant. If
                you give only one, it will be propagated to all variants.

          Currently, only Visual Studio v9.0 and Visual Studio version v11
          are implemented, for other versions no file is generated. To
          generate the user file, you just need to add a DebugSettings
          dictionary to the environment with the right parameters for your
          MSVS version. If the dictionary is empty, or does not contain
          any good value, no file will be generated.

          Following is a more contrived example, involving the setup of a
          project for variants and DebugSettings:

# Assuming you store your defaults in a file
vars = Variables('variables.py')
msvcver = vars.args.get('vc', '9')

# Check command args to force one Microsoft Visual Studio version
if msvcver == '9' or msvcver == '11':
  env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION=msvcver+'.0', MSVC_BATCH=False)
else:
  env = Environment()

                buildtarget=[dll[0]] * 2,
                variant=('Debug|Win32', 'Release|Win32'),
                cmdargs='vc=%s' %  msvcver,
                DebugSettings=(dbgSettings, {}))

   MSVSSolution()
          env.MSVSSolution()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.

          This builds a Visual Studio solution file, based on the version
          of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [1289]$MSVS_VERSION in the
          construction environment). For Visual Studio 6, it will generate
          a .dsw file. For Visual Studio 7 (.NET), it will generate a .sln
          file.

          The following values must be specified:

        target
                The name of the target .dsw or .sln file. The correct
                suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but
                the value [1290]$MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX will be defined to the
                correct value (see example below).

        variant
                The name of this particular variant, or a list of variant
                names (the latter is only supported for MSVS 7 solutions).
                These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but
                really can be anything you want. For MSVS 7 they may also
                specify target platform, like this "Debug|Xbox". Default
                platform is Win32.

        projects
                A list of project file names, or Project nodes returned by
                calls to the MSVSProject Builder, to be placed into the
                solution file. It should be noted that these file names
                are NOT added to the $SOURCES environment variable in form
                of files, but rather as strings. This is because they
                represent file names to be added to the solution file, not
                the source files used to build the solution file.

          Example Usage:

env.MSVSSolution(
    target="Bar" + env["MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX"],
    projects=["bar" + env["MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX"]],
    variant="Release",
)

   Ninja()
          env.Ninja()
          A special builder which adds a target to create a Ninja build
          file. The builder does not require any source files to be
          specified.

Note

          This is an experimental feature. To enable it you must use one
          of the following methods

# On the command line
--experimental=ninja

# Or in your SConstruct
SetOption('experimental', 'ninja')

          This functionality is subject to change and/or removal without
          deprecation cycle.

          To use this tool you need to install the Python ninja package,
          as the tool by default depends on being able to do an import of
          the package This can be done via:

python -m pip install ninja

          If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a
          target name of ninja.build.

          If called with a single positional argument, scons will "deduce"
          the target name from that source argument, giving it the same
          name, and then ignore the source. This is the usual way to call
          the builder if a non-default target name is wanted.

          If called with either the target= or source= keyword arguments,
          the value of the argument is taken as the target name. If called
          with both, the target= value is used and source= is ignored. If
          called with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored,
          since there is no way to deduce what the intent was; in this
          case the default target name will be used.

          Available since scons 4.2.

   Object()
          env.Object()
          A synonym for the StaticObject builder method.

   Package()
          env.Package()
          Builds software distribution packages. A package is a container
          format which includes files to install along with metadata.
          Packaging is optional, and must be enabled by specifying the
          [1291]packaging tool. For example:

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'packaging'])

          SCons can build packages in a number of well known packaging
          formats. The target package type may be selected with the the
          [1292]$PACKAGETYPE construction variable or the --package-type
          command line option. The package type may be a list, in which
          case SCons will attempt to build packages for each type in the
          list. Example:

env.Package(PACKAGETYPE=['src_zip', 'src_targz'], ...other args...)

          The currently supported packagers are:

   msi Microsoft Installer package
   rpm RPM Package Manger package
   ipkg Itsy Package Management package
   tarbz2 bzip2-compressed tar file
   targz gzip-compressed tar file
   tarxz xz-compressed tar file
   zip zip file
   src_tarbz2 bzip2-compressed tar file suitable as source to another
   packager
   src_targz gzip-compressed tar file suitable as source to another
   packager
   src_tarxz xz-compressed tar file suitable as source to another packager
   src_zip zip file suitable as source to another packager

          The file list to include in the package may be specified with
          the source keyword argument. If omitted, the
          [1293]FindInstalledFiles function is called behind the scenes to
          select all files that have an [1294]Install, [1295]InstallAs or
          [1296]InstallVersionedLib Builder attached. If the target
          keyword argument is omitted, the target name(s) will be deduced
          from the package type(s).

          The metadata comes partly from attributes of the files to be
          packaged, and partly from packaging tags. Tags can be passed as
          keyword arguments to the Package builder call, and may also be
          attached to files (or more accurately, Nodes representing files)
          with the [1297]Tag function. Some package-level tags are
          mandatory, and will lead to errors if omitted. The mandatory
          tags vary depending on the package type.

          While packaging, the builder uses a temporary location named by
          the value of the [1298]$PACKAGEROOT variable - the package
          sources are copied there before packaging.

          Packaging example:

env = Environment(tools=["default", "packaging"])
env.Install("/bin/", "my_program")
env.Package(
    NAME="foo",
    VERSION="1.2.3",
    PACKAGEVERSION=0,
    PACKAGETYPE="rpm",
    LICENSE="gpl",
    SUMMARY="balalalalal",
    DESCRIPTION="this should be really really long",
    X_RPM_GROUP="Application/fu",
    SOURCE_URL="https://foo.org/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz",
)

          In this example, the target /bin/my_program created by the
          Install call would not be built by default since it is not under
          the project top directory. However, since no source is specified
          to the Package builder, it is selected for packaging by the
          default sources rule. Since packaging is done using
          [1299]$PACKAGEROOT, no write is actually done to the system's
          /bin directory, and the target will be selected since after
          rebasing to underneath $PACKAGEROOT it is now under the top
          directory of the project.

   PCH()
          env.PCH()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header. Calling this
          builder returns a list of two targets: the PCH as the first
          element, and the object file as the second element. Normally the
          object file is ignored. This builder is only provided when
          Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the compiler. The PCH
          builder is generally used in conjunction with the [1300]$PCH
          construction variable to force object files to use the
          precompiled header:

env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]

   PDF()
          env.PDF()
          Builds a .pdf file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [1301]$PDFSUFFIX construction variable (.pdf by default) is
          added automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PDF(target = 'aaa.pdf', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.pdf from bbb.dvi
env.PDF(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   POInit()
          env.POInit()
          This builder belongs to [1302]msginit tool. The builder
          initializes missing PO file(s) if [1303]$POAUTOINIT is set. If
          [1304]$POAUTOINIT is not set (default), POInit prints
          instruction for user (that is supposed to be a translator),
          telling how the PO file should be initialized. In normal
          projects you should not use POInit and use [1305]POUpdate
          instead. [1306]POUpdate chooses intelligently between
          msgmerge(1) and msginit(1). POInit always uses msginit(1) and
          should be regarded as builder for special purposes or for
          temporary use (e.g. for quick, one time initialization of a
          bunch of PO files) or for tests.

          Target nodes defined through POInit are not built by default
          (they're Ignored from '.' node) but are added to special Alias
          ('po-create' by default). The alias name may be changed through
          the [1307]$POCREATE_ALIAS construction variable. All PO files
          defined through POInit may be easily initialized by scons
          po-create.

          Example 1. Initialize en.po and pl.po from messages.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl']) # messages.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 2. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], ['foo']) # foo.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 3. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot but using
          [1308]$POTDOMAIN construction variable:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo') # foo.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 4. Initialize PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS
          file. The files will be initialized from template messages.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(LINGUAS_FILE = 1) # needs 'LINGUAS' file

          Example 5. Initialize en.po and pl.pl PO files plus files for
          languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files will be initialized
          from template messages.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 6. You may preconfigure your environment first, and then
          initialize PO files:

  # ...
  env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
  env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
  env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
  env.POInit()

          which has same efect as:

  # ...
  env.POInit(POAUTOINIT = 1, LINGUAS_FILE = 1, POTDOMAIN = 'foo')

   PostScript()
          env.PostScript()
          Builds a .ps file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [1309]$PSSUFFIX construction variable (.ps by default) is added
          automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PostScript(target = 'aaa.ps', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.ps from bbb.dvi
env.PostScript(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   POTUpdate()
          env.POTUpdate()
          The builder belongs to [1310]xgettext tool. The builder updates
          target POT file if exists or creates one if it doesn't. The node
          is not built by default (i.e. it is Ignored from '.'), but only
          on demand (i.e. when given POT file is required or when special
          alias is invoked). This builder adds its targe node
          (messages.pot, say) to a special alias (pot-update by default,
          see [1311]$POTUPDATE_ALIAS) so you can update/create them easily
          with scons pot-update. The file is not written until there is no
          real change in internationalized messages (or in comments that
          enter POT file).

Note

          You may see xgettext(1) being invoked by the [1312]xgettext tool
          even if there is no real change in internationalized messages
          (so the POT file is not being updated). This happens every time
          a source file has changed. In such case we invoke xgettext(1)
          and compare its output with the content of POT file to decide
          whether the file should be updated or not.

          Example 1. Let's create po/ directory and place following
          SConstruct script there:

  # SConstruct in 'po/' subdir
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(['foo'], ['../a.cpp', '../b.cpp'])
  env.POTUpdate(['bar'], ['../c.cpp', '../d.cpp'])

          Then invoke scons few times:

  user@host:$ scons             # Does not create foo.pot nor bar.pot
  user@host:$ scons foo.pot     # Updates or creates foo.pot
  user@host:$ scons pot-update  # Updates or creates foo.pot and bar.pot
  user@host:$ scons -c          # Does not clean foo.pot nor bar.pot.

          the results shall be as the comments above say.

          Example 2. The POTUpdate builder may be used with no target
          specified, in which case default target messages.pot will be
          used. The default target may also be overridden by setting
          [1313]$POTDOMAIN construction variable or providing it as an
          override to POTUpdate builder:


  # SConstruct script
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env['POTDOMAIN'] = "foo"
  env.POTUpdate(source = ["a.cpp", "b.cpp"]) # Creates foo.pot ...
  env.POTUpdate(POTDOMAIN = "bar", source = ["c.cpp", "d.cpp"]) # and bar.pot

          Example 3. The sources may be specified within separate file,
          for example POTFILES.in:


  # POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory
  ../a.cpp
  ../b.cpp
  # end of file

          The name of the file (POTFILES.in) containing the list of
          sources is provided via [1314]$XGETTEXTFROM:


  # SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in')

          Example 4. You may use [1315]$XGETTEXTPATH to define source
          search path. Assume, for example, that you have files a.cpp,
          b.cpp, po/SConstruct, po/POTFILES.in. Then your POT-related
          files could look as below:

  # POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory
  a.cpp
  b.cpp
  # end of file

  # SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH='../')

          Example 5. Multiple search directories may be defined within a
          list, i.e. XGETTEXTPATH = ['dir1', 'dir2', ...]. The order in
          the list determines the search order of source files. The path
          to the first file found is used.

          Let's create 0/1/po/SConstruct script:

  # SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../', '../../'])

          and 0/1/po/POTFILES.in:

  # POTFILES.in in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
  a.cpp
  # end of file

          Write two *.cpp files, the first one is 0/a.cpp:

  /* 0/a.cpp */
  gettext("Hello from ../../a.cpp")

          and the second is 0/1/a.cpp:

  /* 0/1/a.cpp */
  gettext("Hello from ../a.cpp")

          then run scons. You'll obtain 0/1/po/messages.pot with the
          message "Hello from ../a.cpp". When you reverse order in
          $XGETTEXTFOM, i.e. when you write SConscript as

  # SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../../', '../'])

          then the messages.pot will contain msgid "Hello from
          ../../a.cpp" line and not msgid "Hello from ../a.cpp".

   POUpdate()
          env.POUpdate()
          The builder belongs to [1316]msgmerge tool. The builder updates
          PO files with msgmerge(1), or initializes missing PO files as
          described in documentation of [1317]msginit tool and
          [1318]POInit builder (see also [1319]$POAUTOINIT). Note, that
          POUpdate does not add its targets to po-create alias as
          [1320]POInit does.

          Target nodes defined through POUpdate are not built by default
          (they're Ignored from '.' node). Instead, they are added
          automatically to special Alias ('po-update' by default). The
          alias name may be changed through the [1321]$POUPDATE_ALIAS
          construction variable. You can easily update PO files in your
          project by scons po-update.

          Example 1. Update en.po and pl.po from messages.pot template
          (see also [1322]$POTDOMAIN), assuming that the later one exists
          or there is rule to build it (see [1323]POTUpdate):

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(['en','pl']) # messages.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 2. Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot template:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], ['foo']) # foo.pot -->  [en.po, pl.pl]

          Example 3. Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot (another
          version):

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo') # foo.pot -- > [en.po, pl.pl]

          Example 4. Update files for languages defined in LINGUAS file.
          The files are updated from messages.pot template:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1) # needs 'LINGUAS' file

          Example 5. Same as above, but update from foo.pot template:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, source = ['foo'])

          Example 6. Update en.po and pl.po plus files for languages
          defined in LINGUAS file. The files are updated from messages.pot
          template:

  # produce 'en.po', 'pl.po' + files defined in 'LINGUAS':
  env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl' ], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 7. Use [1324]$POAUTOINIT to automatically initialize PO
          file if it doesn't exist:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, POAUTOINIT = 1)

          Example 8. Update PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS
          file. The files are updated from foo.pot template. All necessary
          settings are pre-configured via environment.

  # ...
  env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
  env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
  env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
  env.POUpdate()

   Program()
          env.Program()
          Builds an executable given one or more object files or C, C++,
          D, or Fortran source files. If any C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files are specified, then they will be automatically compiled to
          object files using the Object builder method; see that builder
          method's description for a list of legal source file suffixes
          and how they are interpreted. The target executable file prefix,
          specified by the [1325]$PROGPREFIX construction variable
          (nothing by default), and suffix, specified by the
          [1326]$PROGSUFFIX construction variable (by default, .exe on
          Windows systems, nothing on POSIX systems), are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.Program(target='foo', source=['foo.o', 'bar.c', 'baz.f'])

   ProgramAllAtOnce()
          env.ProgramAllAtOnce()
          Builds an executable from D sources without first creating
          individual objects for each file.

          D sources can be compiled file-by-file as C and C++ source are,
          and D is integrated into the scons Object and Program builders
          for this model of build. D codes can though do whole source
          meta-programming (some of the testing frameworks do this). For
          this it is imperative that all sources are compiled and linked
          in a single call to the D compiler. This builder serves that
          purpose.

    env.ProgramAllAtOnce('executable', ['mod_a.d, mod_b.d', 'mod_c.d'])

          This command will compile the modules mod_a, mod_b, and mod_c in
          a single compilation process without first creating object files
          for the modules. Some of the D compilers will create
          executable.o others will not.

   RES()
          env.RES()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ resource file. This builder method
          is only provided when Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW is being
          used as the compiler. The .res (or .o for MinGW) suffix is added
          to the target name if no other suffix is given. The source file
          is scanned for implicit dependencies as though it were a C file.
          Example:

env.RES('resource.rc')

   RMIC()
          env.RMIC()
          Builds stub and skeleton class files for remote objects from
          Java .class files. The target is a directory relative to which
          the stub and skeleton class files will be written. The source
          can be the names of .class files, or the objects return from the
          Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [1327]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the RMIC builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

classes = env.Java(target = 'classdir', source = 'src')
env.RMIC(target = 'outdir1', source = classes)

env.RMIC(target = 'outdir2',
         source = ['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'])

env.RMIC(target = 'outdir3',
         source = ['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
         JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes')

   RPCGenClient()
          env.RPCGenClient()
          Generates an RPC client stub (_clnt.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_clnt.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenHeader()
          env.RPCGenHeader()
          Generates an RPC header (.h) file from a specified RPC (.x)
          source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif.h
env.RPCGenHeader('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenService()
          env.RPCGenService()
          Generates an RPC server-skeleton (_svc.c) file from a specified
          RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in
          the local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_svc.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenXDR()
          env.RPCGenXDR()
          Generates an RPC XDR routine (_xdr.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_xdr.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   SharedLibrary()
          env.SharedLibrary()
          Builds a shared library (.so on a POSIX system, .dll on Windows)
          given one or more object files or C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files. If any source files are given, then they will be
          automatically compiled to object files. The target library file
          prefix, specified by the [1328]$SHLIBPREFIX construction
          variable (by default, lib on POSIX systems, nothing on Windows
          systems), and suffix, specified by the [1329]$SHLIBSUFFIX
          construction variable (by default, .dll on Windows systems, .so
          on POSIX systems), are automatically added to the target if not
          already present. Example:

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          On Windows systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always
          build an import library (.lib) in addition to the shared library
          (.dll), adding a .lib library with the same basename if there is
          not already a .lib file explicitly listed in the targets.

          On Cygwin systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always
          build an import library (.dll.a) in addition to the shared
          library (.dll), adding a .dll.a library with the same basename
          if there is not already a .dll.a file explicitly listed in the
          targets.

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          shared library (that is, using the SharedObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

          On some platforms, there is a distinction between a shared
          library (loaded automatically by the system to resolve external
          references) and a loadable module (explicitly loaded by user
          action). For maximum portability, use the [1330]LoadableModule
          builder for the latter.

          When the [1331]$SHLIBVERSION construction variable is defined, a
          versioned shared library is created. This modifies
          [1332]$SHLINKFLAGS as required, adds the version number to the
          library name, and creates any symbolic links that are needed.

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'], SHLIBVERSION='1.5.2')

          On a POSIX system, versions with a single token create exactly
          one symlink: libbar.so.6 would have symlink libbar.so only. On a
          POSIX system, versions with two or more tokens create exactly
          two symlinks: libbar.so.2.3.1 would have symlinks libbar.so and
          libbar.so.2; on a Darwin (OSX) system the library would be
          libbar.2.3.1.dylib and the link would be libbar.dylib.

          On Windows systems, specifying register=1 will cause the .dll to
          be registered after it is built. The command that is run is
          determined by the [1333]$REGSVR construction variable (regsvr32
          by default), and the flags passed are determined by
          [1334]$REGSVRFLAGS. By default, [1335]$REGSVRFLAGS includes the
          /s option, to prevent dialogs from popping up and requiring user
          attention when it is run. If you change [1336]$REGSVRFLAGS, be
          sure to include the /s option. For example,

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.cxx', 'foo.obj'], register=1)

          will register bar.dll as a COM object when it is done linking
          it.

   SharedObject()
          env.SharedObject()
          Builds an object file intended for inclusion in a shared
          library. Source files must have one of the same set of
          extensions specified above for the StaticObject builder method.
          On some platforms building a shared object requires additional
          compiler option (e.g. -fPIC for gcc) in addition to those needed
          to build a normal (static) object, but on some platforms there
          is no difference between a shared object and a normal (static)
          one. When there is a difference, SCons will only allow shared
          objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use a
          different suffix for shared objects. On platforms where there is
          no difference, SCons will allow both normal (static) and shared
          objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use the
          same suffix for shared and normal (static) objects. The target
          object file prefix, specified by the [1337]$SHOBJPREFIX
          construction variable (by default, the same as
          [1338]$OBJPREFIX), and suffix, specified by the
          [1339]$SHOBJSUFFIX construction variable, are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Examples:

env.SharedObject(target='ddd', source='ddd.c')
env.SharedObject(target='eee.o', source='eee.cpp')
env.SharedObject(target='fff.obj', source='fff.for')

          Note that the source files will be scanned according to the
          suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner object. See the manpage
          section "Scanner Objects" for more information.

   StaticLibrary()
          env.StaticLibrary()
          Builds a static library given one or more object files or C,
          C++, D or Fortran source files. If any source files are given,
          then they will be automatically compiled to object files. The
          static library file prefix, specified by the [1340]$LIBPREFIX
          construction variable (by default, lib on POSIX systems, nothing
          on Windows systems), and suffix, specified by the
          [1341]$LIBSUFFIX construction variable (by default, .lib on
          Windows systems, .a on POSIX systems), are automatically added
          to the target if not already present. Example:

env.StaticLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          static library (that is, using the StaticObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

   StaticObject()
          env.StaticObject()
          Builds a static object file from one or more C, C++, D, or
          Fortran source files. Source files must have one of the
          following extensions:

  .asm    assembly language file
  .ASM    assembly language file
  .c      C file
  .C      Windows:  C file
          POSIX:  C++ file
  .cc     C++ file
  .cpp    C++ file
  .cxx    C++ file
  .cxx    C++ file
  .c++    C++ file
  .C++    C++ file
  .d      D file
  .f      Fortran file
  .F      Windows:  Fortran file
          POSIX:  Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .for    Fortran file
  .FOR    Fortran file
  .fpp    Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .FPP    Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .m      Object C file
  .mm     Object C++ file
  .s      assembly language file
  .S      Windows:  assembly language file
          ARM: CodeSourcery Sourcery Lite
  .sx     assembly language file + C pre-processor
          POSIX:  assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .spp    assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .SPP    assembly language file + C pre-processor

          The target object file prefix, specified by the [1342]$OBJPREFIX
          construction variable (nothing by default), and suffix,
          specified by the [1343]$OBJSUFFIX construction variable (.obj on
          Windows systems, .o on POSIX systems), are automatically added
          to the target if not already present. Examples:

env.StaticObject(target='aaa', source='aaa.c')
env.StaticObject(target='bbb.o', source='bbb.c++')
env.StaticObject(target='ccc.obj', source='ccc.f')

          Note that the source files will be scanned according to the
          suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner object. See the manpage
          section "Scanner Objects" for more information.

   Substfile()
          env.Substfile()
          The Substfile builder creates a single text file from a template
          consisting of a file or set of files (or nodes), replacing text
          using the [1344]$SUBST_DICT construction variable (if set). If a
          set, they are concatenated into the target file using the value
          of the [1345]$LINESEPARATOR construction variable as a separator
          between contents; the separator is not emitted after the
          contents of the last file. Nested lists of source files are
          flattened. See also [1346]Textfile.

          If a single source file name is specified and has a .in suffix,
          the suffix is stripped and the remainder of the name is used as
          the default target name.

          The prefix and suffix specified by the [1347]$SUBSTFILEPREFIX
          and [1348]$SUBSTFILESUFFIX construction variables (an empty
          string by default in both cases) are automatically added to the
          target if they are not already present.

          If a construction variable named [1349]$SUBST_DICT is present,
          it may be either a Python dictionary or a sequence of (key,
          value) tuples. If it is a dictionary it is converted into a list
          of tuples with unspecified order, so if one key is a prefix of
          another key or if one substitution could be further expanded by
          another subsitition, it is unpredictable whether the expansion
          will occur.

          Any occurrences of a key in the source are replaced by the
          corresponding value, which may be a Python callable function or
          a string. If the value is a callable, it is called with no
          arguments to get a string. Strings are subst-expanded and the
          result replaces the key.

env = Environment(tools=['default'])

env['prefix'] = '/usr/bin'
script_dict = {'@prefix@': '/bin', '@exec_prefix@': '$prefix'}
env.Substfile('script.in', SUBST_DICT=script_dict)

conf_dict = {'%VERSION%': '1.2.3', '%BASE%': 'MyProg'}
env.Substfile('config.h.in', conf_dict, SUBST_DICT=conf_dict)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one key is a prefix of another
bad_foo = {'$foo': '$foo', '$foobar': '$foobar'}
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT=bad_foo)

# PREDICTABLE - keys are applied longest first
good_foo = [('$foobar', '$foobar'), ('$foo', '$foo')]
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT=good_foo)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one substitution could be futher expanded
bad_bar = {'@bar@': '@soap@', '@soap@': 'lye'}
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT=bad_bar)

# PREDICTABLE - substitutions are expanded in order
good_bar = (('@bar@', '@soap@'), ('@soap@', 'lye'))
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT=good_bar)

# the SUBST_DICT may be in common (and not an override)
substutions = {}
subst = Environment(tools=['textfile'], SUBST_DICT=substitutions)
substitutions['@foo@'] = 'foo'
subst['SUBST_DICT']['@bar@'] = 'bar'
subst.Substfile(
    'pgm1.c',
    [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'), Value('#include "@bar@.h"'), "common.in", "pgm
1.in"],
)
subst.Substfile(
    'pgm2.c',
    [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'), Value('#include "@bar@.h"'), "common.in", "pgm
2.in"],
)


   Tar()
          env.Tar()
          Builds a tar archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Tar builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Tar('src.tar', 'src')

# Create the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', 'another')

# Set TARFLAGS to create a gzip-filtered archive.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z')
env.Tar('foo.tar.gz', 'foo')

# Also set the suffix to .tgz.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z',
                  TARSUFFIX = '.tgz')
env.Tar('foo')

   Textfile()
          env.Textfile()
          The Textfile builder generates a single text file from a
          template consisting of a list of strings, replacing text using
          the [1350]$SUBST_DICT construction variable (if set) - see
          [1351]Substfile for a description of replacement. The strings
          will be separated in the target file using the value of the
          [1352]$LINESEPARATOR construction variable; the line separator
          is not emitted after the last string. Nested lists of source
          strings are flattened. Source strings need not literally be
          Python strings: they can be Nodes or Python objects that convert
          cleanly to [1353]Value nodes

          The prefix and suffix specified by the [1354]$TEXTFILEPREFIX and
          [1355]$TEXTFILESUFFIX construction variables (by default an
          empty string and .txt, respectively) are automatically added to
          the target if they are not already present. Examples:

# builds/writes foo.txt
env.Textfile(target='foo.txt', source=['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'])

# builds/writes bar.txt
env.Textfile(target='bar', source=['lalala', 'tanteratei'], LINESEPARATOR='|*')

# nested lists are flattened automatically
env.Textfile(target='blob', source=['lalala', ['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'], 'tante
ratei'])

# files may be used as input by wraping them in File()
env.Textfile(
    target='concat',  # concatenate files with a marker between
    source=[File('concat1'), File('concat2')],
    LINESEPARATOR='====================\n',
)

          Results:

          foo.txt

  Goethe
  42
  Schiller

          bar.txt

  lalala|*tanteratei

          blob.txt

  lalala
  Goethe
  42
  Schiller
  tanteratei

   Translate()
          env.Translate()
          This pseudo-builder belongs to [1356]gettext toolset. The
          builder extracts internationalized messages from source files,
          updates POT template (if necessary) and then updates PO
          translations (if necessary). If [1357]$POAUTOINIT is set,
          missing PO files will be automatically created (i.e. without
          translator person intervention). The variables
          [1358]$LINGUAS_FILE and [1359]$POTDOMAIN are taken into acount
          too. All other construction variables used by [1360]POTUpdate,
          and [1361]POUpdate work here too.

          Example 1. The simplest way is to specify input files and output
          languages inline in a SCons script when invoking Translate

# SConscript in 'po/' directory
env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
env.Translate(['en','pl'], ['../a.cpp','../b.cpp'])

          Example 2. If you wish, you may also stick to conventional style
          known from autotools, i.e. using POTFILES.in and LINGUAS files

# LINGUAS
en pl
#end

# POTFILES.in
a.cpp
b.cpp
# end

# SConscript
env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
env['XGETTEXTPATH'] = ['../']
env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in')

          The last approach is perhaps the recommended one. It allows
          easily split internationalization/localization onto separate
          SCons scripts, where a script in source tree is responsible for
          translations (from sources to PO files) and script(s) under
          variant directories are responsible for compilation of PO to MO
          files to and for installation of MO files. The "gluing factor"
          synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of LINGUAS
          file. Note, that the updated POT and PO files are usually going
          to be committed back to the repository, so they must be updated
          within the source directory (and not in variant directories).
          Additionaly, the file listing of po/ directory contains LINGUAS
          file, so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they
          may work with the project in their usual way.

          Example 3. Let's prepare a development tree as below

 project/
  + SConstruct
  + build/
  + src/
      + po/
          + SConscript
          + SConscript.i18n
          + POTFILES.in
          + LINGUAS

          with build being variant directory. Write the top-level
          SConstruct script as follows

  # SConstruct
  env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
  VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate = 0)
  env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
  SConscript('src/po/SConscript.i18n', exports = 'env')
  SConscript('build/po/SConscript', exports = 'env')

          the src/po/SConscript.i18n as

  # src/po/SConscript.i18n
  Import('env')
  env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE=1, XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../']
)

          and the src/po/SConscript

  # src/po/SConscript
  Import('env')
  env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Such setup produces POT and PO files under source tree in
          src/po/ and binary MO files under variant tree in build/po/.
          This way the POT and PO files are separated from other output
          files, which must not be committed back to source repositories
          (e.g. MO files).

Note

          In above example, the PO files are not updated, nor created
          automatically when you issue scons '.' command. The files must
          be updated (created) by hand via scons po-update and then MO
          files can be compiled by running scons '.'.

   TypeLibrary()
          env.TypeLibrary()
          Builds a Windows type library (.tlb) file from an input IDL file
          (.idl). In addition, it will build the associated interface stub
          and proxy source files, naming them according to the base name
          of the .idl file. For example,

env.TypeLibrary(source="foo.idl")

          Will create foo.tlb, foo.h, foo_i.c, foo_p.c and foo_data.c
          files.

   Uic()
          env.Uic()
          Builds a header file, an implementation file and a moc file from
          an ui file. and returns the corresponding nodes in the that
          order. This builder is only available after using the tool
          [1362]qt. Note: you can specify .ui files directly as source
          files to the [1363]Program, [1364]Library and
          [1365]SharedLibrary builders without using this builder. Using
          this builder lets you override the standard naming conventions
          (be careful: prefixes are always prepended to names of built
          files; if you don't want prefixes, you may set them to ``). See
          the [1366]$QTDIR variable for more information. Example:

env.Uic('foo.ui')  # -> ['foo.h', 'uic_foo.cc', 'moc_foo.cc']
env.Uic(
    target=Split('include/foo.h gen/uicfoo.cc gen/mocfoo.cc'),
    source='foo.ui'
)  # -> ['include/foo.h', 'gen/uicfoo.cc', 'gen/mocfoo.cc']

   Zip()
          env.Zip()
          Builds a zip archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Zip builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Zip('src.zip', 'src')

          [1513]$_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS.

   default
          Sets construction variables for a default list of Tool modules.
          Use default in the tools list to retain the original defaults,
          since the tools parameter is treated as a literal statement of
          the tools to be made available in that construction environment,
          not an addition.

          The list of tools selected by default is not static, but is
          dependent both on the platform and on the software installed on
          the platform. Some tools will not initialize if an underlying
          command is not found, and some tools are selected from a list of
          choices on a first-found basis. The finished tool list can be
          examined by inspecting the [1514]$TOOLS construction variable in
          the construction environment.

          On all platforms, the tools from the following list are selected
          if their respective conditions are met: filesystem;, wix,
          [1515]lex, [1516]yacc, [1517]rpcgen, [1518]swig, [1519]jar,
          [1520]javac, [1521]javah, [1522]rmic, [1523]dvipdf, [1524]dvips,
          [1525]gs, [1526]tex, [1527]latex, [1528]pdflatex, [1529]pdftex,
          [1530]tar, [1531]zip, [1532]textfile.

          On Linux systems, the default tools list selects (first-found):
          a C compiler from [1533]gcc, [1534]intelc, [1535]icc, [1536]cc;
          a C++ compiler from [1537]g++, [1538]intelc, [1539]icc,
          [1540]cXX; an assembler from [1541]gas, [1542]nasm, [1543]masm;
          a linker from [1544]gnulink, [1545]ilink; a Fortran compiler
          from [1546]gfortran, [1547]g77, [1548]ifort, [1549]ifl,
          [1550]f95, [1551]f90, [1552]f77; and a static archiver [1553]ar.
          It also selects all found from the list [1554]m4 rpm.

          On Windows systems, the default tools list selects
          (first-found): a C compiler from [1555]msvc, [1556]mingw,
          [1557]gcc, [1558]intelc, [1559]icl, [1560]icc, [1561]cc,
          [1562]bcc32; a C++ compiler from [1563]msvc, [1564]intelc,
          [1565]icc, [1566]g++, [1567]cXX, [1568]bcc32; an assembler from
          [1569]masm, [1570]nasm, [1571]gas, [1572]386asm; a linker from
          [1573]mslink, [1574]gnulink, [1575]ilink, [1576]linkloc,
          [1577]ilink32; a Fortran compiler from [1578]gfortran,
          [1579]g77, [1580]ifl, [1581]cvf, [1582]f95, [1583]f90,
          [1584]fortran; and a static archiver from [1585]mslib, [1586]ar,
          [1587]tlib; It also selects all found from the list [1588]msvs,
          [1589]midl.

          On MacOS systems, the default tools list selects (first-found):
          a C compiler from [1590]gcc, [1591]cc; a C++ compiler from
          [1592]g++, [1593]cXX; an assembler [1594]as; a linker from
          [1595]applelink, [1596]gnulink; a Fortran compiler from
          [1597]gfortran, [1598]f95, [1599]f90, [1600]g77; and a static
          archiver [1601]ar. It also selects all found from the list
          [1602]m4, rpm.

          Default lists for other platforms can be found by examining the
          scons source code (see SCons/Tool/__init__.py).

   dmd
          Sets construction variables for D language compiler DMD.

          Sets: [1603]$DC, [1604]$DCOM, [1605]$DDEBUG,
          [1606]$DDEBUGPREFIX, [1607]$DDEBUGSUFFIX, [1608]$DFILESUFFIX,

          [1638]$SHDLINKFLAGS.

   docbook
          This tool tries to make working with Docbook in SCons a little
          easier. It provides several toolchains for creating different
          output formats, like HTML or PDF. Contained in the package is a
          distribution of the Docbook XSL stylesheets as of version
          1.76.1. As long as you don't specify your own stylesheets for
          customization, these official versions are picked as
          default...which should reduce the inevitable setup hassles for
          you.

          Implicit dependencies to images and XIncludes are detected
          automatically if you meet the HTML requirements. The additional
          stylesheet utils/xmldepend.xsl by Paul DuBois is used for this
          purpose.

          Note, that there is no support for XML catalog resolving
          offered! This tool calls the XSLT processors and PDF renderers
          with the stylesheets you specified, that's it. The rest lies in
          your hands and you still have to know what you're doing when
          resolving names via a catalog.

          For activating the tool "docbook", you have to add its name to
          the Environment constructor, like this

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])

          On its startup, the docbook tool tries to find a required
          xsltproc processor, and a PDF renderer, e.g. fop. So make sure
          that these are added to your system's environment PATH and can
          be called directly without specifying their full path.

          For the most basic processing of Docbook to HTML, you need to
          have installed

          + the Python lxml binding to libxml2, or
          + a standalone XSLT processor, currently detected are xsltproc,
            saxon, saxon-xslt and xalan.

          Rendering to PDF requires you to have one of the applications
          fop or xep installed.

          Creating a HTML or PDF document is very simple and
          straightforward. Say

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')
env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          to get both outputs from your XML source manual.xml. As a
          shortcut, you can give the stem of the filenames alone, like
          this:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual')
env.DocbookPdf('manual')

          and get the same result. Target and source lists are also
          supported:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml(['manual.html','reference.html'], ['manual.xml','reference.xml']
)

          or even

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml(['manual','reference'])

Important

          Whenever you leave out the list of sources, you may not specify
          a file extension! The Tool uses the given names as file stems,
          and adds the suffixes for target and source files accordingly.

          The rules given above are valid for the Builders
          [1639]DocbookHtml, [1640]DocbookPdf, [1641]DocbookEpub,
          [1642]DocbookSlidesPdf and [1643]DocbookXInclude. For the
          [1644]DocbookMan transformation you can specify a target name,
          but the actual output names are automatically set from the
          refname entries in your XML source.

          The Builders [1645]DocbookHtmlChunked, [1646]DocbookHtmlhelp and
          [1647]DocbookSlidesHtml are special, in that:

         1. they create a large set of files, where the exact names and
            their number depend on the content of the source file, and
         2. the main target is always named index.html, i.e. the output
            name for the XSL transformation is not picked up by the
            stylesheets.

          As a result, there is simply no use in specifying a target HTML
          name. So the basic syntax for these builders is always:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

          If you want to use a specific XSL file, you can set the
          additional xsl parameter to your Builder call as follows:

env.DocbookHtml('other.html', 'manual.xml', xsl='html.xsl')

          Since this may get tedious if you always use the same local
          naming for your customized XSL files, e.g. html.xsl for HTML and
          pdf.xsl for PDF output, a set of variables for setting the
          default XSL name is provided. These are:

DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLCHUNKED
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLHELP
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_EPUB
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_MAN
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESPDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESHTML

          and you can set them when constructing your environment:

env = Environment(
    tools=['docbook'],
    DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML='html.xsl',
    DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF='pdf.xsl',
)
env.DocbookHtml('manual')  # now uses html.xsl

   gettext
          This is actually a toolset, which supports internationalization
          and localization of software being constructed with SCons. The
          toolset loads following tools:

          + [1843]xgettext - to extract internationalized messages from
            source code to POT file(s),
          + [1844]msginit - may be optionally used to initialize PO files,
          + [1845]msgmerge - to update PO files, that already contain
            translated messages,
          + [1846]msgfmt - to compile textual PO file to binary
            installable MO file.

          When you enable gettext, it internally loads all abovementioned
          tools, so you're encouraged to see their individual
          documentation.

          Each of the above tools provides its own builder(s) which may be
          used to perform particular activities related to software
          internationalization. You may be however interested in top-level
          [1847]Translate builder.

          To use gettext tools add 'gettext' tool to your environment:

  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'gettext'] )

          Available since scons 4.0..

   qt
          Sets construction variables for building Qt3 applications.

Note

          This tool is only suitable for building targeted to Qt3, which
          is obsolete (the tool is deprecated since 4.3). There are
          contributed tools for Qt4 and Qt5, see
          [2306]https://github.com/SCons/scons-contrib. Qt4 has also
          passed end of life for standard support (in Dec 2015).

          Note paths for these construction variables are assembled using
          the os.path.join method so they will have the appropriate
          separator at runtime, but are listed here in the various entries
          only with the '/' separator for simplicity.

          In addition, the construction variables [2307]$CPPPATH,
          [2308]$LIBPATH and [2309]$LIBS may be modified and the variables
          [2310]$PROGEMITTER, [2311]$SHLIBEMITTER and [2312]$LIBEMITTER
          are modified. Because the build-performance is affected when
          using this tool, you have to explicitly specify it at
          Environment creation:

Environment(tools=['default','qt'])

          The qt tool supports the following operations:

          Automatic moc file generation from header files. You do not have
          to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you.
          However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header
          file must have the same filebase as your implementation file and
          must stay in the same directory. It must have one of the
          suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You can turn off automatic moc
          file generation by setting [2313]$QT_AUTOSCAN to False. See also
          the corresponding [2314]Moc Builder.

          Automatic moc file generation from C++ files. As described in
          the Qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of the C++
          file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated
          by the transformation
          ${QT_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
          <basename>.mo. A warning is generated after building the moc
          file if you do not include the correct file. If you are using
          [2315]VariantDir, you may need to specify duplicate=True. You
          can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting
          $QT_AUTOSCAN to False. See also the corresponding [2316]Moc
          Builder.

          Automatic handling of .ui files. The implementation files
          generated from .ui files are handled much the same as yacc or
          lex files. Each .ui file given as a source of [2317]Program,
          [2318]Library or [2319]SharedLibrary will generate three files:
          the declaration file, the implementation file and a moc file.
          Because there are also generated headers, you may need to
          specify duplicate=True in calls to [2320]VariantDir. See also
          the corresponding [2321]Uic Builder.

          Sets: [2322]$QTDIR, [2323]$QT_AUTOSCAN, [2324]$QT_BINPATH,

Appendix D. Functions and Environment Methods

   This appendix contains descriptions of all of the function and
   construction environment methods in this version of SCons

   Action(action, [output, [var, ...]] [key=value, ...])
          env.Action(action, [output, [var, ...]] [key=value, ...])
          A factory function to create an Action object for the specified
          action. See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete
          explanation of the arguments and behavior.

          Note that the env.Action form of the invocation will expand
          construction variables in any argument strings, including the
          action argument, at the time it is called using the construction
          variables in the env construction environment through which
          env.Action was called. The Action global function form delays
          all variable expansion until the Action object is actually used.

   AddMethod(object, function, [name])
          env.AddMethod(function, [name])
          Adds function to an object as a method. function will be called
          with an instance object as the first argument as for other
          methods. If name is given, it is used as the name of the new
          method, else the name of function is used.

          When the global function AddMethod is called, the object to add
          the method to must be passed as the first argument; typically
          this will be Environment, in order to create a method which
          applies to all construction environments subsequently
          constructed. When called using the env.AddMethod form, the
          method is added to the specified construction environment only.
          Added methods propagate through env.Clone calls.

          More examples:

# Function to add must accept an instance argument.
# The Python convention is to call this 'self'.
def my_method(self, arg):
    print("my_method() got", arg)

# Use the global function to add a method to the Environment class:
AddMethod(Environment, my_method)
env = Environment()
env.my_method('arg')

# Use the optional name argument to set the name of the method:
env.AddMethod(my_method, 'other_method_name')
env.other_method_name('another arg')

   AddOption(arguments)
          Adds a local (project-specific) command-line option. arguments
          are the same as those supported by the add_option method in the
          standard Python library module optparse, with a few additional
          capabilities noted below. See the documentation for optparse for
          a thorough discussion of its option-processing capabities.

          In addition to the arguments and values supported by the
          optparse add_option method, AddOption allows setting the nargs
          keyword value to a string consisting of a question mark ('?') to
          indicate that the option argument for that option string is
          optional. If the option string is present on the command line
          but has no matching option argument, the value of the const
          keyword argument is produced as the value of the option. If the
          option string is omitted from the command line, the value of the
          default keyword argument is produced, as usual; if there is no
          default keyword argument in the AddOption call, None is
          produced.

          optparse recognizes abbreviations of long option names, as long
          as they can be unambiguously resolved. For example, if
          add_option is called to define a --devicename option, it will
          recognize --device, --dev and so forth as long as there is no
          other option which could also match to the same abbreviation.
          Options added via AddOption do not support the automatic
          recognition of abbreviations. Instead, to allow specific
          abbreviations, include them as synonyms in the AddOption call
          itself.

          Once a new command-line option has been added with AddOption,
          the option value may be accessed using [2491]GetOption or
          [2492]env.GetOption. [2493]SetOption is not currently supported
          for options added with AddOption.

          Help text for an option is a combination of the string supplied
          in the help keyword argument to AddOption and information
          collected from the other keyword arguments. Such help is
          displayed if the -h command line option is used (but not with
          -H). Help for all local options is displayed under the separate
          heading Local Options. The options are unsorted - they will
          appear in the help text in the order in which the AddOption
          calls occur.

          Example:

AddOption(
    '--prefix',
    dest='prefix',
    nargs=1,
    type='string',
    action='store',
    metavar='DIR',
    help='installation prefix',
)
env = Environment(PREFIX=GetOption('prefix'))

          For that example, the following help text would be produced:

Local Options:
  --prefix=DIR                installation prefix

          Help text for local options may be unavailable if the [2494]Help
          function has been called, see the Help documentation for
          details.

Note

          As an artifact of the internal implementation, the behavior of
          options added by AddOption which take option arguments is
          undefined if whitespace (rather than an = sign) is used as the
          separator on the command line. Users should avoid such usage; it
          is recommended to add a note to this effect to project
          documentation if the situation is likely to arise. In addition,
          if the nargs keyword is used to specify more than one following
          option argument (that is, with a value of 2 or greater), such
          arguments would necessarily be whitespace separated, triggering
          the issue. Developers should not use AddOption this way. Future
          versions of SCons will likely forbid such usage.

   AddPostAction(target, action)
          env.AddPostAction(target, action)
          Arranges for the specified action to be performed after the
          specified target has been built. The specified action(s) may be
          an Action object, or anything that can be converted into an
          Action object See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a
          complete explanation.

          When multiple targets are supplied, the action may be called
          multiple times, once after each action that generates one or
          more targets in the list.

   AddPreAction(target, action)
          env.AddPreAction(target, action)
          Arranges for the specified action to be performed before the
          specified target is built. The specified action(s) may be an
          Action object, or anything that can be converted into an Action
          object See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete
          explanation.

          When multiple targets are specified, the action(s) may be called
          multiple times, once before each action that generates one or
          more targets in the list.

          Note that if any of the targets are built in multiple steps, the
          action will be invoked just before the "final" action that
          specifically generates the specified target(s). For example,
          when building an executable program from a specified source .c
          file via an intermediate object file:

foo = Program('foo.c')
AddPreAction(foo, 'pre_action')

          The specified pre_action would be executed before scons calls
          the link command that actually generates the executable program
          binary foo, not before compiling the foo.c file into an object
          file.

   Alias(alias, [targets, [action]])
          env.Alias(alias, [targets, [action]])
          Creates one or more phony targets that expand to one or more
          other targets. An optional action (command) or list of actions
          can be specified that will be executed whenever the any of the
          alias targets are out-of-date. Returns the Node object
          representing the alias, which exists outside of any file system.
          This Node object, or the alias name, may be used as a dependency
          of any other target, including another alias. Alias can be
          called multiple times for the same alias to add additional
          targets to the alias, or additional actions to the list for this
          alias. Aliases are global even if set through the construction
          environment method.

          Examples:

Alias('install')
Alias('install', '/usr/bin')
Alias(['install', 'install-lib'], '/usr/local/lib')

env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/lib'])
env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/man'])

env.Alias('update', ['file1', 'file2'], "update_database $SOURCES")

   AllowSubstExceptions([exception, ...])
          Specifies the exceptions that will be allowed when expanding
          construction variables. By default, any construction variable
          expansions that generate a NameError or IndexError exception
          will expand to a '' (an empty string) and not cause scons to
          fail. All exceptions not in the specified list will generate an
          error message and terminate processing.

          If AllowSubstExceptions is called multiple times, each call
          completely overwrites the previous list of allowed exceptions.

          Example:

# Requires that all construction variable names exist.
# (You may wish to do this if you want to enforce strictly
# that all construction variables must be defined before use.)
AllowSubstExceptions()

# Also allow a string containing a zero-division expansion
# like '${1 / 0}' to evalute to ''.
AllowSubstExceptions(IndexError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError)

   AlwaysBuild(target, ...)
          env.AlwaysBuild(target, ...)
          Marks each given target so that it is always assumed to be out
          of date, and will always be rebuilt if needed. Note, however,
          that AlwaysBuild does not add its target(s) to the default
          target list, so the targets will only be built if they are
          specified on the command line, or are a dependent of a target
          specified on the command line--but they will always be built if
          so specified. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call
          to AlwaysBuild.

   env.Append(key=val, [...])
          Intelligently append values to construction variables in the
          construction environment named by env. The construction
          variables and values to add to them are passed as key=val pairs
          (Python keyword arguments). env.Append is designed to allow
          adding values without normally having to know the data type of
          an existing construction variable. Regular Python syntax can
          also be used to manipulate the construction variable, but for
          that you must know the type of the construction variable: for
          example, different Python syntax is needed to combine a list of
          values with a single string value, or vice versa. Some
          pre-defined construction variables do have type expectations
          based on how SCons will use them, for example [2495]$CPPDEFINES
          is normally a string or a list of strings, but can be a string,
          a list of strings, a list of tuples, or a dictionary, while
          [2496]$LIBEMITTER would expect a callable or list of callables,
          and [2497]$BUILDERS would expect a mapping type. Consult the
          documentation for the various construction variables for more
          details.

          The following descriptions apply to both the append and prepend
          functions, the only difference being the insertion point of the
          added values.

          If env. does not have a construction variable indicated by key,
          val is added to the environment under that key as-is.

          val can be almost any type, and SCons will combine it with an
          existing value into an appropriate type, but there are a few
          special cases to be aware of. When two strings are combined, the
          result is normally a new string, with the caller responsible for
          supplying any needed separation. The exception to this is the
          construction variable [2498]$CPPDEFINES, in which each item will
          be postprocessed by adding a prefix and/or suffix, so the
          contents are treated as a list of strings, that is, adding a
          string will result in a separate string entry, not a combined
          string. For $CPPDEFINES as well as for [2499]$LIBS, and the
          various *PATH; variables, SCons will supply the
          compiler-specific syntax (e.g. adding a -D or /D prefix for
          $CPPDEFINES), so this syntax should be omitted when adding
          values to these variables. Example (gcc syntax shown in the
          expansion of CPPDEFINES):

env = Environment(CXXFLAGS="-std=c11", CPPDEFINES="RELEASE")
print("CXXFLAGS={}, CPPDEFINES={}".format(env['CXXFLAGS'], env['CPPDEFINES']))
# notice including a leading space in CXXFLAGS value
env.Append(CXXFLAGS=" -O", CPPDEFINES="EXTRA")
print("CXXFLAGS={}, CPPDEFINES={}".format(env['CXXFLAGS'], env['CPPDEFINES']))
print("CPPDEFINES will expand to {}".format(env.subst("$_CPPDEFFLAGS")))

$ scons -Q
CXXFLAGS=-std=c11, CPPDEFINES=RELEASE
CXXFLAGS=-std=c11 -O, CPPDEFINES=['RELEASE', 'EXTRA']
CPPDEFINES will expand to -DRELEASE -DEXTRA
scons: `.' is up to date.

          Because [2500]$CPPDEFINES is intended to describe C/C++
          pre-processor macro definitions, it accepts additional syntax.
          Preprocessor macros can be valued, or un-valued, as in -DBAR=1
          or -DFOO. The macro can be be supplied as a complete string
          including the value, or as a tuple (or list) of macro, value, or
          as a dictionary. Example (again gcc syntax in the expanded
          defines):

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES="FOO")
print("CPPDEFINES={}".format(env['CPPDEFINES']))
env.Append(CPPDEFINES="BAR=1")
print("CPPDEFINES={}".format(env['CPPDEFINES']))
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=("OTHER", 2))
print("CPPDEFINES={}".format(env['CPPDEFINES']))
env.Append(CPPDEFINES={"EXTRA": "arg"})
print("CPPDEFINES={}".format(env['CPPDEFINES']))
print("CPPDEFINES will expand to {}".format(env.subst("$_CPPDEFFLAGS")))

$ scons -Q
CPPDEFINES=FOO
CPPDEFINES=['FOO', 'BAR=1']
CPPDEFINES=['FOO', 'BAR=1', ('OTHER', 2)]
CPPDEFINES=['FOO', 'BAR=1', ('OTHER', 2), {'EXTRA': 'arg'}]
CPPDEFINES will expand to -DFOO -DBAR=1 -DOTHER=2 -DEXTRA=arg
scons: `.' is up to date.

          Adding a string val to a dictonary construction variable will
          enter val as the key in the dict, and None as its value. Using a
          tuple type to supply a key + value only works for the special
          case of [2501]$CPPDEFINES described above.

          Although most combinations of types work without needing to know
          the details, some combinations do not make sense and a Python
          exception will be raised.

          When using env.Append to modify construction variables which are
          path specifications (conventionally, the names of such end in
          PATH), it is recommended to add the values as a list of strings,
          even if there is only a single string to add. The same goes for
          adding library names to $LIBS.

env.Append(CPPPATH=["#/include"])

          See also [2502]env.AppendUnique, [2503]env.Prepend and
          [2504]env.PrependUnique.

   env.AppendENVPath(name, newpath, [envname, sep, delete_existing=False])
          Append path elements specified by newpath to the given search
          path string or list name in mapping envname in the construction
          environment. Supplying envname is optional: the default is the
          execution environment [2505]$ENV. Optional sep is used as the
          search path separator, the default is the platform's separator
          (os.pathsep). A path element will only appear once. Any
          duplicates in newpath are dropped, keeping the last appearing
          (to preserve path order). If delete_existing is False (the
          default) any addition duplicating an existing path element is
          ignored; if delete_existing is True the existing value will be
          dropped and the path element will be added at the end. To help
          maintain uniqueness all paths are normalized (using
          os.path.normpath and os.path.normcase).

          Example:

print('before:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.AppendENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print('after:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])

          Yields:

before: /foo:/biz
after: /biz:/foo/bar:/foo

          See also [2506]env.PrependENVPath.

   env.AppendUnique(key=val, [...], delete_existing=False)
          Append values to construction variables in the current
          construction environment, maintaining uniqueness. Works like
          [2507]env.Append (see for details), except that values already
          present in the construction variable will not be added again. If
          delete_existing is True, the existing matching value is first
          removed, and the requested value is added, having the effect of
          moving such values to the end.

          Example:

env.AppendUnique(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

          See also [2508]env.Append, [2509]env.Prepend and
          [2510]env.PrependUnique.

   Builder(action, [arguments])
          env.Builder(action, [arguments])
          Creates a Builder object for the specified action. See the
          manpage section "Builder Objects" for a complete explanation of
          the arguments and behavior.

          Note that the env.Builder() form of the invocation will expand
          construction variables in any arguments strings, including the
          action argument, at the time it is called using the construction
          variables in the env construction environment through which
          env.Builder was called. The Builder form delays all variable
          expansion until after the Builder object is actually called.

   CacheDir(cache_dir, custom_class=None)
          env.CacheDir(cache_dir, custom_class=None)
          Direct scons to maintain a derived-file cache in cache_dir. The
          derived files in the cache will be shared among all the builds
          specifying the same cache_dir. Specifying a cache_dir of None
          disables derived file caching.

          When specifying a custom_class which should be a class type
          which is a subclass of SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir, SCons will
          internally invoke this class to use for performing caching
          operations. This argument is optional and if left to default
          None, will use the default SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir class.

          Calling the environment method [2511]env.CacheDir limits the
          effect to targets built through the specified construction
          environment. Calling the global function [2512]CacheDir sets a
          global default that will be used by all targets built through
          construction environments that do not set up
          environment-specific caching by calling env.CacheDir.

          When derived-file caching is being used and scons finds a
          derived file that needs to be rebuilt, it will first look in the
          cache to see if a file with matching build signature exists
          (indicating the input file(s) and build action(s) were identical
          to those for the current target), and if so, will retrieve the
          file from the cache. scons will report Retrieved `file' from
          cache instead of the normal build message. If the derived file
          is not present in the cache, scons will build it and then place
          a copy of the built file in the cache, identified by its build
          signature, for future use.

          The Retrieved `file' from cache messages are useful for human
          consumption, but less so when comparing log files between scons
          runs which will show differences that are noisy and not actually
          significant. To disable, use the --cache-show option. With this
          option, scons will print the action that would have been used to
          build the file without considering cache retrieval.

          Derived-file caching may be disabled for any invocation of scons
          by giving the --cache-disable command line option. Cache
          updating may be disabled, leaving cache fetching enabled, by
          giving the --cache-readonly.

          If the --cache-force option is used, scons will place a copy of
          all derived files in the cache, even if they already existed and
          were not built by this invocation. This is useful to populate a
          cache the first time a cache_dir is used for a build, or to
          bring a cache up to date after a build with cache updating
          disabled (--cache-disable or --cache-readonly) has been done.

          The [2513]NoCache method can be used to disable caching of
          specific files. This can be useful if inputs and/or outputs of
          some tool are impossible to predict or prohibitively large.

          Note that (at this time) SCons provides no facilities for
          managing the derived-file cache. It is up to the developer to
          arrange for cache pruning, expiry, etc. if needed.

   Clean(targets, files_or_dirs)
          env.Clean(targets, files_or_dirs)
          This specifies a list of files or directories which should be
          removed whenever the targets are specified with the -c command
          line option. The specified targets may be a list or an
          individual target. Multiple calls to Clean are legal, and create
          new targets or add files and directories to the clean list for
          the specified targets.

          Multiple files or directories should be specified either as
          separate arguments to the Clean method, or as a list. Clean will
          also accept the return value of any of the construction
          environment Builder methods. Examples:

          The related [2514]NoClean function overrides calling Clean for
          the same target, and any targets passed to both functions will
          not be removed by the -c option.

          Examples:

Clean('foo', ['bar', 'baz'])
Clean('dist', env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))
Clean(['foo', 'bar'], 'something_else_to_clean')

          In this example, installing the project creates a subdirectory
          for the documentation. This statement causes the subdirectory to
          be removed if the project is deinstalled.

Clean(docdir, os.path.join(docdir, projectname))

   env.Clone([key=val, ...])
          Returns a separate copy of a construction environment. If there
          are any keyword arguments specified, they are added to the
          returned copy, overwriting any existing values for the keywords.

          Example:

env2 = env.Clone()
env3 = env.Clone(CCFLAGS='-g')

          Additionally, a list of tools and a toolpath may be specified,
          as in the [2515]Environment constructor:

def MyTool(env):
    env['FOO'] = 'bar'

env4 = env.Clone(tools=['msvc', MyTool])

          The parse_flags keyword argument is also recognized to allow
          merging command-line style arguments into the appropriate
          construction variables (see [2516]env.MergeFlags).

# create an environment for compiling programs that use wxWidgets
wx_env = env.Clone(parse_flags='!wx-config --cflags --cxxflags')

   Command(target, source, action, [key=val, ...])
          env.Command(target, source, action, [key=val, ...])
          Executes a specific action (or list of actions) to build a
          target file or files from a source file or files. This is more
          convenient than defining a separate Builder object for a single
          special-case build.

          The Command function accepts source_scanner, target_scanner,
          source_factory, and target_factory keyword arguments. These
          arguments can be used to specify a Scanner object that will be
          used to apply a custom scanner for a source or target. For
          example, the global DirScanner object can be used if any of the
          sources will be directories that must be scanned on-disk for
          changes to files that aren't already specified in other Builder
          of function calls. The *_factory arguments take a factory
          function that Command will use to turn any sources or targets
          specified as strings into SCons Nodes. See the manpage section
          "Builder Objects" for more information about how these arguments
          work in a Builder.

          Any other keyword arguments specified override any same-named
          existing construction variables.

          An action can be an external command, specified as a string, or
          a callable Python object; see the manpage section "Action
          Objects" for more complete information. Also note that a string
          specifying an external command may be preceded by an at-sign (@)
          to suppress printing the command in question, or by a hyphen (-)
          to ignore the exit status of the external command.

          Examples:

env.Command(
    target='foo.out',
    source='foo.in',
    action="$FOO_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET"
)

env.Command(
    target='bar.out',
    source='bar.in',
    action=["rm -f $TARGET", "$BAR_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET"],
    ENV={'PATH': '/usr/local/bin/'},
)


import os
def rename(env, target, source):
    os.rename('.tmp', str(target[0]))


env.Command(
    target='baz.out',
    source='baz.in',
    action=["$BAZ_BUILD < $SOURCES > .tmp", rename],
)

          Note that the Command function will usually assume, by default,
          that the specified targets and/or sources are Files, if no other
          part of the configuration identifies what type of entries they
          are. If necessary, you can explicitly specify that targets or
          source nodes should be treated as directories by using the
          [2517]Dir or [2518]env.Dir functions.

          Examples:

env.Command('ddd.list', Dir('ddd'), 'ls -l $SOURCE > $TARGET')

env['DISTDIR'] = 'destination/directory'
env.Command(env.Dir('$DISTDIR')), None, make_distdir)

          Also note that SCons will usually automatically create any
          directory necessary to hold a target file, so you normally don't
          need to create directories by hand.

   Configure(env, [custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h])
          env.Configure([custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h])
          Creates a Configure object for integrated functionality similar
          to GNU autoconf. See the manpage section "Configure Contexts"
          for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

   Decider(function)
          env.Decider(function)
          Specifies that all up-to-date decisions for targets built
          through this construction environment will be handled by the
          specified function. function can be the name of a function or
          one of the following strings that specify the predefined
          decision function that will be applied:

        "timestamp-newer"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp is newer than
                the target file's timestamp. This is the behavior of the
                classic Make utility, and make can be used a synonym for
                timestamp-newer.

        "timestamp-match"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp is different
                than the timestamp recorded the last time the target was
                built. This provides behavior very similar to the classic
                Make utility (in particular, files are not opened up so
                that their contents can be checksummed) except that the
                target will also be rebuilt if a dependency file has been
                restored to a version with an earlier timestamp, such as
                can happen when restoring files from backup archives.

        "content"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's content has changed since
                the last time the target was built, as determined be
                performing an checksum on the dependency's contents and
                comparing it to the checksum recorded the last time the
                target was built. MD5 can be used as a synonym for
                content, but it is deprecated.

        "content-timestamp"
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's content has changed since
                the last time the target was built, except that
                dependencies with a timestamp that matches the last time
                the target was rebuilt will be assumed to be up-to-date
                and not rebuilt. This provides behavior very similar to
                the content behavior of always checksumming file contents,
                with an optimization of not checking the contents of files
                whose timestamps haven't changed. The drawback is that
                SCons will not detect if a file's content has changed but
                its timestamp is the same, as might happen in an automated
                script that runs a build, updates a file, and runs the
                build again, all within a single second. MD5-timestamp can
                be used as a synonym for content-timestamp, but it is
                deprecated.

          Examples:

# Use exact timestamp matches by default.
Decider('timestamp-match')

# Use hash content signatures for any targets built
# with the attached construction environment.
env.Decider('content')

          In addition to the above already-available functions, the
          function argument may be a Python function you supply. Such a
          function must accept the following four arguments:

        dependency
                The Node (file) which should cause the target to be
                rebuilt if it has "changed" since the last tme target was
                built.

        target
                The Node (file) being built. In the normal case, this is
                what should get rebuilt if the dependency has "changed."

        prev_ni
                Stored information about the state of the dependency the
                last time the target was built. This can be consulted to
                match various file characteristics such as the timestamp,
                size, or content signature.

        repo_node
                If set, use this Node instead of the one specified by
                dependency to determine if the dependency has changed.
                This argument is optional so should be written as a
                default argument (typically it would be written as
                repo_node=None). A caller will normally only set this if
                the target only exists in a Repository.

          The function should return a value which evaluates True if the
          dependency has "changed" since the last time the target was
          built (indicating that the target should be rebuilt), and a
          value which evaluates False otherwise (indicating that the
          target should not be rebuilt). Note that the decision can be
          made using whatever criteria are appopriate. Ignoring some or
          all of the function arguments is perfectly normal.

          Example:

def my_decider(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
    return not os.path.exists(str(target))

env.Decider(my_decider)

   Default(target[, ...])
          env.Default(target[, ...])
          Specify default targets to the SCons target selection mechanism.
          Any call to Default will cause SCons to use the defined default
          target list instead of its built-in algorithm for determining
          default targets (see the manpage section "Target Selection").

          target may be one or more strings, a list of strings, a NodeList
          as returned by a Builder, or None. A string target may be the
          name of a file or directory, or a target previously defined by a
          call to [2519]Alias (defining the alias later will still create
          the alias, but it will not be recognized as a default). Calls to
          Default are additive. A target of None will clear any existing
          default target list; subsequent calls to Default will add to the
          (now empty) default target list like normal.

          Both forms of this call affect the same global list of default
          targets; the construction environment method applies
          construction variable expansion to the targets.

          The current list of targets added using Default is available in
          the DEFAULT_TARGETS list (see below).

          Examples:

Default('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
env.Default(['a', 'b', 'c'])
hello = env.Program('hello', 'hello.c')
env.Default(hello)

   DefaultEnvironment([**kwargs])
          Instantiates and returns the default construction environment
          object. The default environment is used internally by SCons in
          order to execute many of the global functions in this list (that
          is, those not called as methods of a specific construction
          environment). It is not mandatory to call DefaultEnvironment:
          the default environment will be instantiated automatically when
          the build phase begins if the function has not been called,
          however calling it explicitly gives the opportunity to affect
          and examine the contents of the default environment.

          The default environment is a singleton, so the keyword arguments
          affect it only on the first call, on subsequent calls the
          already-constructed object is returned and any keyword arguments
          are silently ignored. The default environment can be modified
          after instantiation in the same way as any construction
          environment. Modifying the default environment has no effect on
          the construction environment constructed by an [2520]Environment
          or [2521]Clone call.

   Depends(target, dependency)
          env.Depends(target, dependency)
          Specifies an explicit dependency; the target will be rebuilt
          whenever the dependency has changed. Both the specified target
          and dependency can be a string (usually the path name of a file
          or directory) or Node objects, or a list of strings or Node
          objects (such as returned by a Builder call). This should only
          be necessary for cases where the dependency is not caught by a
          Scanner for the file.

          Example:

env.Depends('foo', 'other-input-file-for-foo')

mylib = env.Library('mylib.c')
installed_lib = env.Install('lib', mylib)
bar = env.Program('bar.c')

# Arrange for the library to be copied into the installation
# directory before trying to build the "bar" program.
# (Note that this is for example only.  A "real" library
# dependency would normally be configured through the $LIBS
# and $LIBPATH variables, not using an env.Depends() call.)

env.Depends(bar, installed_lib)

   env.Detect(progs)
          Find an executable from one or more choices: progs may be a
          string or a list of strings. Returns the first value from progs
          that was found, or None. Executable is searched by checking the
          paths in the execution environment (env['ENV']['PATH']). On
          Windows systems, additionally applies the filename suffixes
          found in the execution environment (env['ENV']['PATHEXT']) but
          will not include any such extension in the return value.
          env.Detect is a wrapper around [2522]env.WhereIs.

   env.Dictionary([vars])
          Returns a dictionary object containing the construction
          variables in the construction environment. If there are any
          arguments specified, the values of the specified construction
          variables are returned as a string (if one argument) or as a
          list of strings.

          Example:

cvars = env.Dictionary()
cc_values = env.Dictionary('CC', 'CCFLAGS', 'CCCOM')

   Dir(name, [directory])
          env.Dir(name, [directory])
          Returns Directory Node(s). A Directory Node is an object that
          represents a directory. name can be a relative or absolute path
          or a list of such paths. directory is an optional directory that
          will be used as the parent directory. If no directory is
          specified, the current script's directory is used as the parent.

          If name is a single pathname, the corresponding node is
          returned. If name is a list, SCons returns a list of nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in name.

          Directory Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string
          as a directory name to a Builder method or function. Directory
          Nodes have attributes and methods that are useful in many
          situations; see manpage section "File and Directory Nodes" for
          more information.

   env.Dump([key], [format])
          Serializes construction variables to a string. The method
          supports the following formats specified by format:

        pretty
                Returns a pretty printed representation of the environment
                (if format is not specified, this is the default).

        json
                Returns a JSON-formatted string representation of the
                environment.

          If key is None (the default) the entire dictionary of
          construction variables is serialized. If supplied, it is taken
          as the name of a construction variable whose value is
          serialized.

          This SConstruct:

env=Environment()
print(env.Dump('CCCOM'))

          will print:

'$CC -c -o $TARGET $CCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPDEFFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS $SOURCES'

          While this SConstruct:

env = Environment()
print(env.Dump())

          will print:

{ 'AR': 'ar',
  'ARCOM': '$AR $ARFLAGS $TARGET $SOURCES\n$RANLIB $RANLIBFLAGS $TARGET',
  'ARFLAGS': ['r'],
  'AS': 'as',
  'ASCOM': '$AS $ASFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCES',
  'ASFLAGS': [],
  ...

   EnsurePythonVersion(major, minor)
          env.EnsurePythonVersion(major, minor)
          Ensure that the Python version is at least major.minor. This
          function will print out an error message and exit SCons with a
          non-zero exit code if the actual Python version is not late
          enough.

          Example:

EnsurePythonVersion(2,2)

   EnsureSConsVersion(major, minor, [revision])
          env.EnsureSConsVersion(major, minor, [revision])
          Ensure that the SCons version is at least major.minor, or
          major.minor.revision. if revision is specified. This function
          will print out an error message and exit SCons with a non-zero
          exit code if the actual SCons version is not late enough.

          Examples:

EnsureSConsVersion(0,14)

EnsureSConsVersion(0,96,90)

   Environment([key=value, ...])
          env.Environment([key=value, ...])
          Return a new construction environment initialized with the
          specified key=value pairs. The keyword arguments parse_flags,
          platform, toolpath, tools and variables are also specially
          recognized. See the manpage section "Construction Environments"
          for more details.

   Execute(action, [actionargs ...])
          env.Execute(action, [actionargs ...])
          Executes an Action. action may be an Action object or it may be
          a command-line string, list of commands, or executable Python
          function, each of which will first be converted into an Action
          object and then executed. Any additional arguments to Execute
          are passed on to the [2523]Action factory function which
          actually creates the Action object (see the manpage section
          [2524]Action Objects for a description). Example:

Execute(Copy('file.out', 'file.in'))

          Execute performs its action immediately, as part of the
          SConscript-reading phase. There are no sources or targets
          declared in an Execute call, so any objects it manipulates will
          not be tracked as part of the SCons dependency graph. In the
          example above, neither file.out nor file.in will be tracked
          objects.

          Execute returns the exit value of the command or return value of
          the Python function. scons prints an error message if the
          executed action fails (exits with or returns a non-zero value),
          however it does not, automatically terminate the build for such
          a failure. If you want the build to stop in response to a failed
          Execute call, you must explicitly check for a non-zero return
          value:

if Execute("mkdir sub/dir/ectory"):
    # The mkdir failed, don't try to build.
    Exit(1)

   Exit([value])
          env.Exit([value])
          This tells scons to exit immediately with the specified value. A
          default exit value of 0 (zero) is used if no value is specified.

   Export([vars...], [key=value...])
          env.Export([vars...], [key=value...])
          Exports variables from the current SConscript file to a global
          collection where they can be imported by other SConscript files.
          vars may be one or more strings representing variable names to
          be exported. If a string contains whitespace, it is split into
          separate strings, as if multiple string arguments had been
          given. A vars argument may also be a dictionary, which can be
          used to map variables to different names when exported. Keyword
          arguments can be used to provide names and their values.

          Export calls are cumulative. Specifying a previously exported
          variable will overwrite the earlier value. Both local variables
          and global variables can be exported.

          Examples:

env = Environment()
# Make env available for all SConscript files to Import().
Export("env")

package = 'my_name'
# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:.
Export("env", "package")

# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:
Export(["env", "package"])

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export(debug=env)

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export({"debug": env})

          Note that the [2525]SConscript function supports an exports
          argument that allows exporting a variable or set of variables to
          a specific SConscript file or files. See the description below.

   File(name, [directory])
          env.File(name, [directory])
          Returns File Node(s). A File Node is an object that represents a
          file. name can be a relative or absolute path or a list of such
          paths. directory is an optional directory that will be used as
          the parent directory. If no directory is specified, the current
          script's directory is used as the parent.

          If name is a single pathname, the corresponding node is
          returned. If name is a list, SCons returns a list of nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in name.

          File Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string as a
          file name to a Builder method or function. File Nodes have
          attributes and methods that are useful in many situations; see
          manpage section "File and Directory Nodes" for more information.

   FindFile(file, dirs)
          env.FindFile(file, dirs)
          Search for file in the path specified by dirs. dirs may be a
          list of directory names or a single directory name. In addition
          to searching for files that exist in the filesystem, this
          function also searches for derived files that have not yet been
          built.

          Example:

foo = env.FindFile('foo', ['dir1', 'dir2'])

   FindInstalledFiles()
          env.FindInstalledFiles()
          Returns the list of targets set up by the [2526]Install or
          [2527]InstallAs builders.

          This function serves as a convenient method to select the
          contents of a binary package.

          Example:

Install('/bin', ['executable_a', 'executable_b'])

# will return the file node list
# ['/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b']
FindInstalledFiles()

Install('/lib', ['some_library'])

# will return the file node list
# ['/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b', '/lib/some_library']
FindInstalledFiles()

   FindPathDirs(variable)
          Returns a function (actually a callable Python object) intended
          to be used as the path_function of a Scanner object. The
          returned object will look up the specified variable in a
          construction environment and treat the construction variable's
          value as a list of directory paths that should be searched (like
          [2528]$CPPPATH, [2529]$LIBPATH, etc.).

          Note that use of FindPathDirs is generally preferable to writing
          your own path_function for the following reasons: 1) The
          returned list will contain all appropriate directories found in
          source trees (when [2530]VariantDir is used) or in code
          repositories (when Repository or the -Y option are used). 2)
          scons will identify expansions of variable that evaluate to the
          same list of directories as, in fact, the same list, and avoid
          re-scanning the directories for files, when possible.

          Example:

def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    # Code to scan file contents goes here...
    return include_files

scanner = Scanner(name = 'myscanner',
                  function = my_scan,
                  path_function = FindPathDirs('MYPATH'))

   FindSourceFiles(node='"."')
          env.FindSourceFiles(node='"."')
          Returns the list of nodes which serve as the source of the built
          files. It does so by inspecting the dependency tree starting at
          the optional argument node which defaults to the '"."'-node. It
          will then return all leaves of node. These are all children
          which have no further children.

          This function is a convenient method to select the contents of a
          Source Package.

          Example:

Program('src/main_a.c')
Program('src/main_b.c')
Program('main_c.c')

# returns ['main_c.c', 'src/main_a.c', 'SConstruct', 'src/main_b.c']
FindSourceFiles()

# returns ['src/main_b.c', 'src/main_a.c' ]
FindSourceFiles('src')

          As you can see build support files (SConstruct in the above
          example) will also be returned by this function.

   Flatten(sequence)
          env.Flatten(sequence)
          Takes a sequence (that is, a Python list or tuple) that may
          contain nested sequences and returns a flattened list containing
          all of the individual elements in any sequence. This can be
          helpful for collecting the lists returned by calls to Builders;
          other Builders will automatically flatten lists specified as
          input, but direct Python manipulation of these lists does not.

          Examples:

foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')

# Because `foo' and `bar' are lists returned by the Object() Builder,
# `objects' will be a list containing nested lists:
objects = ['f1.o', foo, 'f2.o', bar, 'f3.o']

# Passing such a list to another Builder is all right because
# the Builder will flatten the list automatically:
Program(source = objects)

# If you need to manipulate the list directly using Python, you need to
# call Flatten() yourself, or otherwise handle nested lists:
for object in Flatten(objects):
    print(str(object))

   GetBuildFailures()
          Returns a list of exceptions for the actions that failed while
          attempting to build targets. Each element in the returned list
          is a BuildError object with the following attributes that record
          various aspects of the build failure:

          .node The node that was being built when the build failure
          occurred.

          .status The numeric exit status returned by the command or
          Python function that failed when trying to build the specified
          Node.

          .errstr The SCons error string describing the build failure.
          (This is often a generic message like "Error 2" to indicate that
          an executed command exited with a status of 2.)

          .filename The name of the file or directory that actually caused
          the failure. This may be different from the .node attribute. For
          example, if an attempt to build a target named sub/dir/target
          fails because the sub/dir directory could not be created, then
          the .node attribute will be sub/dir/target but the .filename
          attribute will be sub/dir.

          .executor The SCons Executor object for the target Node being
          built. This can be used to retrieve the construction environment
          used for the failed action.

          .action The actual SCons Action object that failed. This will be
          one specific action out of the possible list of actions that
          would have been executed to build the target.

          .command The actual expanded command that was executed and
          failed, after expansion of [2531]$TARGET, [2532]$SOURCE, and
          other construction variables.

          Note that the GetBuildFailures function will always return an
          empty list until any build failure has occurred, which means
          that GetBuildFailures will always return an empty list while the
          SConscript files are being read. Its primary intended use is for
          functions that will be executed before SCons exits by passing
          them to the standard Python atexit.register() function. Example:

import atexit

def print_build_failures():
    from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
    for bf in GetBuildFailures():
        print("%s failed: %s" % (bf.node, bf.errstr))

atexit.register(print_build_failures)

   GetBuildPath(file, [...])
          env.GetBuildPath(file, [...])
          Returns the scons path name (or names) for the specified file
          (or files). The specified file or files may be scons Nodes or
          strings representing path names.

   GetLaunchDir()
          env.GetLaunchDir()
          Returns the absolute path name of the directory from which scons
          was initially invoked. This can be useful when using the -u, -U
          or -D options, which internally change to the directory in which
          the SConstruct file is found.

   GetOption(name)
          env.GetOption(name)
          This function provides a way to query the value of options which
          can be set via the command line or using the [2533]SetOption
          function.

          name can be an entry from the following table, which shows the
          corresponding command line arguments that could affect the
          value. name can be also be the destination variable name from a
          project-specific option added using the [2534]AddOption
          function, as long as the addition happens prior to the GetOption
          call in the SConscript files.

   Glob(pattern, [ondisk, source, strings, exclude])
          env.Glob(pattern, [ondisk, source, strings, exclude])
          Returns Nodes (or strings) that match the specified pattern,
          relative to the directory of the current SConscript file. The
          evironment method form (env.Glob) performs string substition on
          pattern and returns whatever matches the resulting expanded
          pattern.

          The specified pattern uses Unix shell style metacharacters for
          matching:

  *       matches everything
  ?       matches any single character
  [seq]   matches any character in seq
  [!seq]  matches any char not in seq

          If the first character of a filename is a dot, it must be
          matched explicitly. Character matches do not span directory
          separators.

          The Glob knows about repositories (see the [2537]Repository
          function) and source directories (see the [2538]VariantDir
          function) and returns a Node (or string, if so configured) in
          the local (SConscript) directory if a matching Node is found
          anywhere in a corresponding repository or source directory.

          The ondisk argument may be set to a value which evaluates False
          to disable the search for matches on disk, thereby only
          returning matches among already-configured File or Dir Nodes.
          The default behavior is to return corresponding Nodes for any
          on-disk matches found.

          The source argument may be set to a value which evaluates True
          to specify that, when the local directory is a VariantDir, the
          returned Nodes should be from the corresponding source
          directory, not the local directory.

          The strings argument may be set to a value which evaluates True
          to have the Glob function return strings, not Nodes, that
          represent the matched files or directories. The returned strings
          will be relative to the local (SConscript) directory. (Note that
          This may make it easier to perform arbitrary manipulation of
          file names, but if the returned strings are passed to a
          different SConscript file, any Node translation will be relative
          to the other SConscript directory, not the original SConscript
          directory.)

          The exclude argument may be set to a pattern or a list of
          patterns (following the same Unix shell semantics) which must be
          filtered out of returned elements. Elements matching a least one
          pattern of this list will be excluded.

          Examples:

Program("foo", Glob("*.c"))
Zip("/tmp/everything", Glob(".??*") + Glob("*"))
sources = Glob("*.cpp", exclude=["os_*_specific_*.cpp"]) + \
          Glob( "os_%s_specific_*.cpp" % currentOS)

   Help(text, append=False)
          env.Help(text, append=False)
          Specifies a local help message to be printed if the -h argument
          is given to scons. Subsequent calls to Help append text to the
          previously defined local help text.

          For the first call to Help only, if append is False (the
          default) any local help message generated through
          [2539]AddOption calls is replaced. If append is True, text is
          appended to the existing help text.

   Ignore(target, dependency)
          env.Ignore(target, dependency)
          The specified dependency file(s) will be ignored when deciding
          if the target file(s) need to be rebuilt.

          You can also use Ignore to remove a target from the default
          build. In order to do this you must specify the directory the
          target will be built in as the target, and the file you want to
          skip building as the dependency.

          Note that this will only remove the dependencies listed from the
          files built by default. It will still be built if that
          dependency is needed by another object being built. See the
          third and forth examples below.

          Examples:

env.Ignore('foo', 'foo.c')
env.Ignore('bar', ['bar1.h', 'bar2.h'])
env.Ignore('.', 'foobar.obj')
env.Ignore('bar', 'bar/foobar.obj')

   Import(vars...)
          env.Import(vars...)
          Imports variables into the current SConscript file. vars must be
          strings representing names of variables which have been
          previously exported either by the [2540]Export function or by
          the exports argument to [2541]SConscript. Variables exported by
          SConscript take precedence. Multiple variable names can be
          passed to Import as separate arguments or as words in a
          space-separated string. The wildcard "*" can be used to import
          all available variables.

          Examples:

Import("env")
Import("env", "variable")
Import(["env", "variable"])
Import("*")

   Literal(string)
          env.Literal(string)
          The specified string will be preserved as-is and not have
          construction variables expanded.

   Local(targets)
          env.Local(targets)
          The specified targets will have copies made in the local tree,
          even if an already up-to-date copy exists in a repository.
          Returns a list of the target Node or Nodes.

   env.MergeFlags(arg, [unique])
          Merges values from arg into construction variables in the
          current construction environment. If arg is not a dictionary, it
          is converted to one by calling [2542]env.ParseFlags on the
          argument before the values are merged. Note that arg must be a
          single value, so multiple strings must be passed in as a list,
          not as separate arguments to env.MergeFlags.

          If unique is true (the default), duplicate values are not
          stored. When eliminating duplicate values, any construction
          variables that end with the string PATH keep the left-most
          unique value. All other construction variables keep the
          right-most unique value. If unique is false, values are added
          even if they are duplicates.

          Examples:

# Add an optimization flag to $CCFLAGS.
env.MergeFlags('-O3')

# Combine the flags returned from running pkg-config with an optimization
# flag and merge the result into the construction variables.
env.MergeFlags(['!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags', '-O3'])

# Combine an optimization flag with the flags returned from running pkg-config
# twice and merge the result into the construction variables.
env.MergeFlags(
    [
        '-O3',
        '!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags --libs',
        '!pkg-config libpng12 --cflags --libs',
    ]
)

   NoCache(target, ...)
          env.NoCache(target, ...)
          Specifies a list of files which should not be cached whenever
          the [2543]CacheDir method has been activated. The specified
          targets may be a list or an individual target.

          Multiple files should be specified either as separate arguments
          to the NoCache method, or as a list. NoCache will also accept
          the return value of any of the construction environment Builder
          methods.

          Calling NoCache on directories and other non-File Node types has
          no effect because only File Nodes are cached.

          Examples:

NoCache('foo.elf')
NoCache(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

   NoClean(target, ...)
          env.NoClean(target, ...)
          Specifies a list of files or directories which should not be
          removed whenever the targets (or their dependencies) are
          specified with the -c command line option. The specified targets
          may be a list or an individual target. Multiple calls to NoClean
          are legal, and prevent each specified target from being removed
          by calls to the -c option.

          Multiple files or directories should be specified either as
          separate arguments to the NoClean method, or as a list. NoClean
          will also accept the return value of any of the construction
          environment Builder methods.

          Calling NoClean for a target overrides calling [2544]Clean for
          the same target, and any targets passed to both functions will
          not be removed by the -c option.

          Examples:

NoClean('foo.elf')
NoClean(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

   env.ParseConfig(command, [function, unique])
          Updates the current construction environment with the values
          extracted from the output of running external command, by
          passing it to a helper function. command may be a string or a
          list of strings representing the command and its arguments. If
          function is omitted or None, [2545]env.MergeFlags is used. By
          default, duplicate values are not added to any construction
          variables; you can specify unique=False to allow duplicate
          values to be added.

          command is executed using the SCons execution environment (that
          is, the construction variable [2546]$ENV in the current
          construction environment). If command needs additional
          information to operate properly, that needs to be set in the
          execution environment. For example, pkg-config may need a custom
          value set in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.

          env.MergeFlags needs to understand the output produced by
          command in order to distribute it to appropriate construction
          variables. env.MergeFlags uses a separate function to do that
          processing - see [2547]env.ParseFlags for the details, including
          a a table of options and corresponding construction variables.
          To provide alternative processing of the output of command, you
          can suppply a custom function, which must accept three
          arguments: the construction environment to modify, a string
          argument containing the output from running command, and the
          optional unique flag.

   ParseDepends(filename, [must_exist, only_one])
          env.ParseDepends(filename, [must_exist, only_one])
          Parses the contents of filename as a list of dependencies in the
          style of Make or mkdep, and explicitly establishes all of the
          listed dependencies.

          By default, it is not an error if filename does not exist. The
          optional must_exist argument may be set to True to have SCons
          raise an exception if the file does not exist, or is otherwise
          inaccessible.

          The optional only_one argument may be set to True to have SCons
          raise an exception if the file contains dependency information
          for more than one target. This can provide a small sanity check
          for files intended to be generated by, for example, the gcc -M
          flag, which should typically only write dependency information
          for one output file into a corresponding .d file.

          filename and all of the files listed therein will be interpreted
          relative to the directory of the SConscript file which calls the
          ParseDepends function.

   env.ParseFlags(flags, ...)
          Parses one or more strings containing typical command-line flags
          for GCC-style tool chains and returns a dictionary with the flag
          values separated into the appropriate SCons construction
          variables. Intended as a companion to the [2548]env.MergeFlags
          method, but allows for the values in the returned dictionary to
          be modified, if necessary, before merging them into the
          construction environment. (Note that env.MergeFlags will call
          this method if its argument is not a dictionary, so it is
          usually not necessary to call env.ParseFlags directly unless you
          want to manipulate the values.)

          If the first character in any string is an exclamation mark (!),
          the rest of the string is executed as a command, and the output
          from the command is parsed as GCC tool chain command-line flags
          and added to the resulting dictionary. This can be used to call
          a *-config command typical of the POSIX programming environment
          (for example, pkg-config). Note that such a comamnd is executed
          using the SCons execution environment; if the command needs
          additional information, that information needs to be explcitly
          provided. See [2549]ParseConfig for more details.

          Flag values are translated accordig to the prefix found, and
          added to the following construction variables:

-arch                   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-D                      CPPDEFINES
-framework              FRAMEWORKS

-Wp,                    CPPFLAGS
-                       CCFLAGS
+                       CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS

          Any other strings not associated with options are assumed to be
          the names of libraries and added to the $LIBS construction
          variable.

          Examples (all of which produce the same result):

dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2 -Dfoo -Dbar=1')
dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '-Dfoo', '-Dbar=1')
dict = env.ParseFlags(['-O2', '-Dfoo -Dbar=1'])
dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '!echo -Dfoo -Dbar=1')

   Platform(plat)
          env.Platform(plat)
          When called as a global function, returns a callable platform
          object selected by plat (defaults to the detected platform for
          the current system) that can be used to initialize a
          construction environment by passing it as the platform keyword
          argument to the [2550]Environment function.

          Example:

env = Environment(platform=Platform('win32'))

          When called as a method of an environment, calls the platform
          object indicated by plat to update that environment.

env.Platform('posix')

          See the manpage section "Construction Environments" for more
          details.

   Precious(target, ...)
          env.Precious(target, ...)
          Marks each given target as precious so it is not deleted before
          it is rebuilt. Normally scons deletes a target before building
          it. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call to
          Precious.

   env.Prepend(key=val, [...])
          Prepend values to construction variables in the current
          construction environment, Works like [2551]env.Append (see for
          details), except that values are added to the front, rather than
          the end, of any existing value of the construction variable

          Example:

env.Prepend(CCFLAGS='-g ', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

          See also [2552]env.Append, [2553]env.AppendUnique and
          [2554]env.PrependUnique.

   env.PrependENVPath(name, newpath, [envname, sep, delete_existing=True])
          Prepend path elements specified by newpath to the given search
          path string or list name in mapping envname in the construction
          environment. Supplying envname is optional: the default is the
          execution environment [2555]$ENV. Optional sep is used as the
          search path separator, the default is the platform's separator
          (os.pathsep). A path element will only appear once. Any
          duplicates in newpath are dropped, keeping the first appearing
          (to preserve path order). If delete_existing is False any
          addition duplicating an existing path element is ignored; if
          delete_existing is True (the default) the existing value will be
          dropped and the path element will be inserted at the beginning.
          To help maintain uniqueness all paths are normalized (using
          os.path.normpath and os.path.normcase).

          Example:

print('before:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.PrependENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print('after:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])

          Yields:

before: /biz:/foo
after: /foo/bar:/foo:/biz

          See also [2556]env.AppendENVPath.

   env.PrependUnique(key=val, delete_existing=False, [...])
          Prepend values to construction variables in the current
          construction environment, maintaining uniqueness. Works like
          [2557]env.Append (see for details), except that values are added
          to the front, rather than the end, of any existing value of the
          construction variable, and values already present in the
          construction variable will not be added again. If
          delete_existing is True, the existing matching value is first
          removed, and the requested value is inserted, having the effect
          of moving such values to the front.

          Example:

env.PrependUnique(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

          See also [2558]env.Append, [2559]env.AppendUnique and
          [2560]env.Prepend.

   Progress(callable, [interval])
          Progress(string, [interval, file, overwrite])
          Progress(list_of_strings, [interval, file, overwrite])
          Allows SCons to show progress made during the build by
          displaying a string or calling a function while evaluating Nodes
          (e.g. files).

          If the first specified argument is a Python callable (a function
          or an object that has a __call__ method), the function will be
          called once every interval times a Node is evaluated (default
          1). The callable will be passed the evaluated Node as its only
          argument. (For future compatibility, it's a good idea to also
          add *args and **kwargs as arguments to your function or method
          signatures. This will prevent the code from breaking if SCons
          ever changes the interface to call the function with additional
          arguments in the future.)

          An example of a simple custom progress function that prints a
          string containing the Node name every 10 Nodes:

def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kwargs):
    print('Evaluating node %s!' % node)
Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)

          A more complicated example of a custom progress display object
          that prints a string containing a count every 100 evaluated
          Nodes. Note the use of \r (a carriage return) at the end so that
          the string will overwrite itself on a display:

import sys
class ProgressCounter(object):
    count = 0
    def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
        self.count += 100
        sys.stderr.write('Evaluated %s nodes\r' % self.count)

Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)

          If the first argument to Progress is a string or list of
          strings, it is taken as text to be displayed every interval
          evaluated Nodes. If the first argument is a list of strings,
          then each string in the list will be displayed in rotating
          fashion every interval evaluated Nodes.

          The default is to print the string on standard output. An
          alternate output stream may be specified with the file keyword
          argument, which the caller must pass already opened.

          The following will print a series of dots on the error output,
          one dot for every 100 evaluated Nodes:

import sys
Progress('.', interval=100, file=sys.stderr)

          If the string contains the verbatim substring $TARGET;, it will
          be replaced with the Node. Note that, for performance reasons,
          this is not a regular SCons variable substition, so you can not
          use other variables or use curly braces. The following example
          will print the name of every evaluated Node, using a carriage
          return) (\r) to cause each line to overwritten by the next line,
          and the overwrite keyword argument (default False) to make sure
          the previously-printed file name is overwritten with blank
          spaces:

import sys
Progress('$TARGET\r', overwrite=True)

          A list of strings can be used to implement a "spinner" on the
          user's screen as follows, changing every five evaluated Nodes:

Progress(['-\r', '\\\r', '|\r', '/\r'], interval=5)

   Pseudo(target, ...)
          env.Pseudo(target, ...)
          This indicates that each given target should not be created by
          the build rule, and if the target is created, an error will be
          generated. This is similar to the gnu make .PHONY target.
          However, in the vast majority of cases, an Alias is more
          appropriate. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call
          to Pseudo.

   PyPackageDir(modulename)
          env.PyPackageDir(modulename)
          This returns a Directory Node similar to Dir. The python module
          / package is looked up and if located the directory is returned
          for the location. modulename Is a named python package / module
          to lookup the directory for it's location.

          If modulename is a list, SCons returns a list of Dir nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in modulename.

   env.Replace(key=val, [...])
          Replaces construction variables in the Environment with the
          specified keyword arguments.

          Example:

env.Replace(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO='foo.xxx')

   Repository(directory)
          env.Repository(directory)
          Specifies that directory is a repository to be searched for
          files. Multiple calls to Repository are legal, and each one adds
          to the list of repositories that will be searched.

          To scons, a repository is a copy of the source tree, from the
          top-level directory on down, which may contain both source files
          and derived files that can be used to build targets in the local
          source tree. The canonical example would be an official source
          tree maintained by an integrator. If the repository contains
          derived files, then the derived files should have been built
          using scons, so that the repository contains the necessary
          signature information to allow scons to figure out when it is
          appropriate to use the repository copy of a derived file,
          instead of building one locally.

          Note that if an up-to-date derived file already exists in a
          repository, scons will not make a copy in the local directory
          tree. In order to guarantee that a local copy will be made, use
          the [2561]Local method.

   Requires(target, prerequisite)
          env.Requires(target, prerequisite)
          Specifies an order-only relationship between the specified
          target file(s) and the specified prerequisite file(s). The
          prerequisite file(s) will be (re)built, if necessary, before the
          target file(s), but the target file(s) do not actually depend on
          the prerequisites and will not be rebuilt simply because the
          prerequisite file(s) change.

          Example:

env.Requires('foo', 'file-that-must-be-built-before-foo')

   Return([vars..., stop=True])
          Return to the calling SConscript, optionally returning the
          values of variables named in vars. Multiple strings contaning
          variable names may be passed to Return. A string containing
          white space is split into individual variable names. Returns the
          value if one variable is specified, else returns a tuple of
          values. Returns an empty tuple if vars is omitted.

          By default Return stops processing the current SConscript and
          returns immediately. The optional stop keyword argument may be
          set to a false value to continue processing the rest of the
          SConscript file after the Return call (this was the default
          behavior prior to SCons 0.98.) However, the values returned are
          still the values of the variables in the named vars at the point
          Return was called.

          Examples:

# Returns no values (evaluates False)
Return()

# Returns the value of the 'foo' Python variable.
Return("foo")

# Returns the values of the Python variables 'foo' and 'bar'.
Return("foo", "bar")

# Returns the values of Python variables 'val1' and 'val2'.
Return('val1 val2')

   Scanner(function, [name, argument, skeys, path_function, node_class,
          node_factory, scan_check, recursive])
          env.Scanner(function, [name, argument, skeys, path_function,
          node_class, node_factory, scan_check, recursive])
          Creates a Scanner object for the specified function. See manpage
          section "Scanner Objects" for a complete explanation of the
          arguments and behavior.

   SConscript(scripts, [exports, variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist])
          env.SConscript(scripts, [exports, variant_dir, duplicate,
          must_exist])
          SConscript(dirs=subdirs, [name=scriptname, exports, variant_dir,
          duplicate, must_exist])
          env.SConscript(dirs=subdirs, [name=scriptname, exports,
          variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist])
          Executes one or more subsidiary SConscript (configuration)
          files. There are two ways to call the SConscript function.

          The first calling style is to supply one or more SConscript file
          names as the first (positional) argument. A single script may be
          specified as a string; multiple scripts must be specified as a
          list of strings (either explicitly or as created by a function
          like [2562]Split). Examples:

SConscript('SConscript')  # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript('src/SConscript')  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(['src/SConscript', 'doc/SConscript'])
config = SConscript('MyConfig.py')

          The other calling style is to omit the positional argument
          naming scripts and instead specify a list of directory names
          using the dirs keyword argument. In this case, scons will
          execute a subsidiary configuration file named SConscript in each
          of the specified directories. You may specify a name other than
          SConscript by supplying an optional name=scriptname keyword
          argument. The first three examples below have the same effect as
          the first three examples above:

SConscript(dirs='.')  # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(dirs='src')  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(dirs=['src', 'doc'])
SConscript(dirs=['sub1', 'sub2'], name='MySConscript')

          The optional exports keyword argument provides a string or list
          of strings representing variable names, or a dictionary of named
          values, to export. For the first calling style only, a second
          positional argument will be interpreted as exports; the second
          calling style must use the keyword argument form for exports.
          These variables are locally exported only to the called
          SConscript file(s) and do not affect the global pool of
          variables managed by the [2563]Export function. The subsidiary
          SConscript files must use the [2564]Import function to import
          the variables. Examples:

foo = SConscript('sub/SConscript', exports='env')
SConscript('dir/SConscript', exports=['env', 'variable'])
SConscript(dirs='subdir', exports='env variable')
SConscript(dirs=['one', 'two', 'three'], exports='shared_info')

          If the optional variant_dir argument is present, it causes an
          effect equivalent to the [2565]VariantDir function, but in
          effect only within the scope of the SConscript call. The
          variant_dir argument is interpreted relative to the directory of
          the calling SConscript file. The source directory is the
          directory in which the called SConscript file resides and the
          SConscript file is evaluated as if it were in the variant_dir
          directory. Thus:

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build')

          is equivalent to:

VariantDir('build', 'src')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

          If the sources are in the same directory as the SConstruct,

SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='build')

          is equivalent to:

VariantDir('build', '.')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

          The optional duplicate argument is interpreted as for
          [2566]VariantDir. If the variant_dir argument is omitted, the
          duplicate argument is ignored. See the description of
          [2567]VariantDir for additional details and restrictions.

          If the optional must_exist is True, causes an exception to be
          raised if a requested SConscript file is not found. The current
          default is False, causing only a warning to be emitted, but this
          default is deprecated (since 3.1). For scripts which truly
          intend to be optional, transition to explicitly supplying
          must_exist=False to the SConscript call.

          Here are some composite examples:

# collect the configuration information and use it to build src and doc
shared_info = SConscript('MyConfig.py')
SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='shared_info')
SConscript('doc/SConscript', exports='shared_info')

# build debugging and production versions.  SConscript
# can use Dir('.').path to determine variant.
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0)
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0)

# build debugging and production versions.  SConscript
# is passed flags to use.
opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['DEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-pgdb' }
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0, exports=opts)
opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['NODEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-O' }
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0, exports=opts)

# build common documentation and compile for different architectures
SConscript('doc/SConscript', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/x86', duplicate=0)
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/ppc', duplicate=0)

          SConscript returns the values of any variables named by the
          executed SConscript file(s) in arguments to the [2568]Return
          function. If a single SConscript call causes multiple scripts to
          be executed, the return value is a tuple containing the returns
          of each of the scripts. If an executed script does not
          explicitly call Return, it returns None.

   SConscriptChdir(value)
          env.SConscriptChdir(value)
          By default, scons changes its working directory to the directory
          in which each subsidiary SConscript file lives. This behavior
          may be disabled by specifying either:

SConscriptChdir(0)
env.SConscriptChdir(0)

          in which case scons will stay in the top-level directory while
          reading all SConscript files. (This may be necessary when
          building from repositories, when all the directories in which
          SConscript files may be found don't necessarily exist locally.)
          You may enable and disable this ability by calling
          SConscriptChdir multiple times.

          Example:

env = Environment()
SConscriptChdir(0)
SConscript('foo/SConscript')    # will not chdir to foo
env.SConscriptChdir(1)
SConscript('bar/SConscript')    # will chdir to bar

   SConsignFile([name, dbm_module])
          env.SConsignFile([name, dbm_module])
          Specify where to store the SCons file signature database, and
          which database format to use. This may be useful to specify
          alternate database files and/or file locations for different
          types of builds.

          The optional name argument is the base name of the database
          file(s). If not an absolute path name, these are placed relative
          to the directory containing the top-level SConstruct file. The
          default is .sconsign. The actual database file(s) stored on disk
          may have an appropriate suffix appended by the chosen dbm_module

          The optional dbm_module argument specifies which Python database
          module to use for reading/writing the file. The module must be
          imported first; then the imported module name is passed as the
          argument. The default is a custom SCons.dblite module that uses
          pickled Python data structures, which works on all Python
          versions. See documentation of the Python dbm module for other
          available types.

          If called with no arguments, the database will default to
          .sconsign.dblite in the top directory of the project, which is
          also the default if if SConsignFile is not called.

          The setting is global, so the only difference between the global
          function and the environment method form is variable expansion
          on name. There should only be one active call to this
          function/method in a given build setup.

          If name is set to None, scons will store file signatures in a
          separate .sconsign file in each directory, not in a single
          combined database file. This is a backwards-compatibility meaure
          to support what was the default behavior prior to SCons 0.97
          (i.e. before 2008). Use of this mode is discouraged and may be
          deprecated in a future SCons release.

          Examples:

# Explicitly stores signatures in ".sconsign.dblite"
# in the top-level SConstruct directory (the default behavior).
SConsignFile()

# Stores signatures in the file "etc/scons-signatures"
# relative to the top-level SConstruct directory.
# SCons will add a database suffix to this name.
SConsignFile("etc/scons-signatures")

# Stores signatures in the specified absolute file name.
# SCons will add a database suffix to this name.
SConsignFile("/home/me/SCons/signatures")

# Stores signatures in a separate .sconsign file
# in each directory.
SConsignFile(None)

# Stores signatures in a GNU dbm format .sconsign file
import dbm.gnu
SConsignFile(dbm_module=dbm.gnu)

   env.SetDefault(key=val, [...])
          Sets construction variables to default values specified with the
          keyword arguments if (and only if) the variables are not already
          set. The following statements are equivalent:

env.SetDefault(FOO='foo')
if 'FOO' not in env:
    env['FOO'] = 'foo'

   SetOption(name, value)
          env.SetOption(name, value)
          Sets scons option variable name to value. These options are all
          also settable via command-line options but the variable name may
          differ from the command-line option name - see the table for
          correspondences. A value set via command-line option will take
          precedence over one set with SetOption, which allows setting a
          project default in the scripts and temporarily overriding it via
          command line. SetOption calls can also be placed in the
          site_init.py file.

          See the documentation in the manpage for the corresponding
          command line option for information about each specific option.
          The value parameter is mandatory, for option values which are
          boolean in nature (that is, the command line option does not
          take an argument) use a value which evaluates to true (e.g.
          True, 1) or false (e.g. False, 0).

          Options which affect the reading and processing of SConscript
          files are not settable using SetOption since those files must be
          read in order to find the SetOption call in the first place.

          The settable variables with their associated command-line
          options are:

   Settable name Command-line options Notes
   clean -c, --clean, --remove
   diskcheck --diskcheck
   duplicate --duplicate
   experimental --experimental since 4.2
   hash_chunksize --hash-chunksize Actually sets md5_chunksize. since 4.2
   hash_format --hash-format since 4.2
   help -h, --help
   implicit_cache --implicit-cache
   implicit_deps_changed --implicit-deps-changed Also sets implicit_cache.
   (settable since 4.2)
   implicit_deps_unchanged --implicit-deps-unchanged Also sets
   implicit_cache. (settable since 4.2)
   max_drift --max-drift

   (but not if set in a site_init.py file) there will still be an initial
   status message about reading SConscript files since SCons has to start
   reading them before it can see the SetOption.

          Example:

SetOption('max_drift', 0)

   SideEffect(side_effect, target)
          env.SideEffect(side_effect, target)
          Declares side_effect as a side effect of building target. Both
          side_effect and target can be a list, a file name, or a node. A
          side effect is a target file that is created or updated as a
          side effect of building other targets. For example, a Windows
          PDB file is created as a side effect of building the .obj files
          for a static library, and various log files are created updated
          as side effects of various TeX commands. If a target is a side
          effect of multiple build commands, scons will ensure that only
          one set of commands is executed at a time. Consequently, you
          only need to use this method for side-effect targets that are
          built as a result of multiple build commands.

          Because multiple build commands may update the same side effect
          file, by default the side_effect target is not automatically
          removed when the target is removed by the -c option. (Note,
          however, that the side_effect might be removed as part of
          cleaning the directory in which it lives.) If you want to make
          sure the side_effect is cleaned whenever a specific target is
          cleaned, you must specify this explicitly with the [2571]Clean
          or env.Clean function.

          This function returns the list of side effect Node objects that
          were successfully added. If the list of side effects contained
          any side effects that had already been added, they are not added
          and included in the returned list.

   Split(arg)
          env.Split(arg)
          If arg is a string, splits on whitespace and returns a list of
          strings without whitespace. This mode is the most common case,
          and can be used to split a list of filenames (for example)
          rather than having to type them as a list of individually quoted
          words. If arg is a list or tuple returns the list or tuple
          unchanged. If arg is any other type of object, returns a list
          containing just the object. These non-string cases do not
          actually do any spliting, but allow an argument variable to be
          passed to Split without having to first check its type.

          Example:

files = Split("f1.c f2.c f3.c")
files = env.Split("f4.c f5.c f6.c")
files = Split("""
    f7.c
    f8.c
    f9.c
""")

   env.subst(input, [raw, target, source, conv])
          Performs construction variable interpolation (substitution) on
          input, which can be a string or a sequence. Substitutable
          elements take the form ${expression}, although if there is no
          ambiguity in recognizing the element, the braces can be omitted.
          A literal $ can be entered by using $$.

          By default, leading or trailing white space will be removed from
          the result, and all sequences of white space will be compressed
          to a single space character. Additionally, any $( and $)
          character sequences will be stripped from the returned string,
          The optional raw argument may be set to 1 if you want to
          preserve white space and $(-$) sequences. The raw argument may
          be set to 2 if you want to additionally discard all characters
          between any $( and $) pairs (as is done for signature
          calculation).

          If input is a sequence (list or tuple), the individual elements
          of the sequence will be expanded, and the results will be
          returned as a list.

          The optional target and source keyword arguments must be set to
          lists of target and source nodes, respectively, if you want the
          $TARGET, $TARGETS, $SOURCE and $SOURCES to be available for
          expansion. This is usually necessary if you are calling
          env.subst from within a Python function used as an SCons action.

          Returned string values or sequence elements are converted to
          their string representation by default. The optional conv
          argument may specify a conversion function that will be used in
          place of the default. For example, if you want Python objects
          (including SCons Nodes) to be returned as Python objects, you
          can use a Python lambda expression to pass in an unnamed
          function that simply returns its unconverted argument.

          Example:

print(env.subst("The C compiler is: $CC"))

def compile(target, source, env):
    sourceDir = env.subst(
        "${SOURCE.srcdir}",
        target=target,
        source=source
    )

source_nodes = env.subst('$EXPAND_TO_NODELIST', conv=lambda x: x)

   Tag(node, tags)
          Annotates file or directory Nodes with information about how the
          [2572]Package Builder should package those files or directories.
          All Node-level tags are optional.

          Examples:

# makes sure the built library will be installed with 644 file access mode
Tag(Library('lib.c'), UNIX_ATTR="0o644")

# marks file2.txt to be a documentation file
Tag('file2.txt', DOC)

   Tool(name, [toolpath, **kwargs])
          env.Tool(name, [toolpath, **kwargs])
          Locates the tool specification module name and returns a
          callable tool object for that tool. The tool module is searched
          for in standard locations and in any paths specified by the
          optional toolpath parameter. The standard locations are SCons'
          own internal path for tools plus the toolpath, if any (see the
          Tools section in the manual page for more details). Any
          additional keyword arguments kwargs are passed to the tool
          module's generate function during tool object construction.

          When called, the tool object updates a construction environment
          with construction variables and arranges any other
          initialization needed to use the mechanisms that tool describes.

          When the env.Tool form is used, the tool object is automatically
          called to update env and the value of tool is appended to the
          [2573]$TOOLS construction variable in that environment.

          Examples:

env.Tool('gcc')
env.Tool('opengl', toolpath=['build/tools'])

          When the global function Tool form is used, the tool object is
          constructed but not called, as it lacks the context of an
          environment to update. The tool object can be passed to an
          [2574]Environment or [2575]Clone call as part of the tools
          keyword argument, in which case the tool is applied to the
          environment being constructed, or it can be called directly, in
          which case a construction environment to update must be passed
          as the argument. Either approach will also update the $TOOLS
          construction variable.

          Examples:

env = Environment(tools=[Tool('msvc')])

env = Environment()
msvctool = Tool('msvc')
msvctool(env)  # adds 'msvc' to the TOOLS variable
gltool = Tool('opengl', toolpath = ['tools'])
gltool(env)  # adds 'opengl' to the TOOLS variable

          Changed in SCons 4.2: env.Tool now returns the tool object,
          previously it did not return (i.e. returned None).

   Value(value, [built_value], [name])
          env.Value(value, [built_value], [name])
          Returns a Node object representing the specified Python value.
          Value Nodes can be used as dependencies of targets. If the
          result of calling str(value) changes between SCons runs, any
          targets depending on Value(value) will be rebuilt. (This is true
          even when using timestamps to decide if files are up-to-date.)
          When using timestamp source signatures, Value Nodes' timestamps
          are equal to the system time when the Node is created. name can
          be provided as an alternative name for the resulting Value node;
          this is advised if the value parameter can't be converted to a
          string.

          The returned Value Node object has a write() method that can be
          used to "build" a Value Node by setting a new value. The
          optional built_value argument can be specified when the Value
          Node is created to indicate the Node should already be
          considered "built." There is a corresponding read() method that
          will return the built value of the Node.

          Examples:

env = Environment()

def create(target, source, env):
    # A function that will write a 'prefix=$SOURCE'
    # string into the file name specified as the
    # $TARGET.
    with open(str(target[0]), 'wb') as f:
        f.write('prefix=' + source[0].get_contents())

# Fetch the prefix= argument, if any, from the command
# line, and use /usr/local as the default.
prefix = ARGUMENTS.get('prefix', '/usr/local')

# Attach a .Config() builder for the above function action
# to the construction environment.
env['BUILDERS']['Config'] = Builder(action = create)
env.Config(target = 'package-config', source = Value(prefix))

def build_value(target, source, env):
    # A function that "builds" a Python Value by updating
    # the Python value with the contents of the file
    # specified as the source of the Builder call ($SOURCE).
    target[0].write(source[0].get_contents())

output = env.Value('before')
input = env.Value('after')

# Attach a .UpdateValue() builder for the above function
# action to the construction environment.
env['BUILDERS']['UpdateValue'] = Builder(action = build_value)
env.UpdateValue(target = Value(output), source = Value(input))

   VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])
          env.VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])
          Sets up a mapping to define a variant build directory in
          variant_dir. src_dir may not be underneath variant_dir. A
          VariantDir mapping is global, even if called using the
          env.VariantDir form. VariantDir can be called multiple times
          with the same src_dir to set up multiple variant builds with
          different options.

          Note if variant_dir is not under the project top directory,
          target selection rules will not pick targets in the variant
          directory unless they are explicitly specified.

          When files in variant_dir are referenced, SCons backfills as
          needed with files from src_dir to create a complete build
          directory. By default, SCons physically duplicates the source
          files, SConscript files, and directory structure as needed into
          the variant directory. Thus, a build performed in the variant
          directory is guaranteed to be identical to a build performed in
          the source directory even if intermediate source files are
          generated during the build, or if preprocessors or other
          scanners search for included files using paths relative to the
          source file, or if individual compilers or other invoked tools
          are hard-coded to put derived files in the same directory as
          source files. Only the files SCons calculates are needed for the
          build are duplicated into variant_dir. If possible on the
          platform, the duplication is performed by linking rather than
          copying. This behavior is affected by the --duplicate
          command-line option.

          Duplicating the source files may be disabled by setting the
          duplicate argument to False. This will cause SCons to invoke
          Builders using the path names of source files in src_dir and the
          path names of derived files within variant_dir. This is more
          efficient than duplicating, and is safe for most builds; revert
          to duplicate=True if it causes problems.

          VariantDir works most naturally when used with a subsidiary
          SConscript file. The subsidiary SConscript file must be called
          as if it were in variant_dir, regardless of the value of
          duplicate. When calling an SConscript file, you can use the
          exports keyword argument to pass parameters (individually or as
          an appropriately set up environment) so the SConscript can pick
          up the right settings for that variant build. The SConscript
          must [2576]Import these to use them. Example:

env1 = Environment(...settings for variant1...)
env2 = Environment(...settings for variant2...)

# run src/SConscript in two variant directories
VariantDir('build/variant1', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant1/SConscript', exports={"env": env1})
VariantDir('build/variant2', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant2/SConscript', exports={"env": env2})

          See also the [2577]SConscript function for another way to
          specify a variant directory in conjunction with calling a
          subsidiary SConscript file.

          More examples:

# use names in the build directory, not the source directory
VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=0)
Program('build/prog', 'build/source.c')

# this builds both the source and docs in a separate subtree
VariantDir('build', '.', duplicate=0)
SConscript(dirs=['build/src','build/doc'])

# same as previous example, but only uses SConscript
SConscript(dirs='src', variant_dir='build/src', duplicate=0)
SConscript(dirs='doc', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)

   WhereIs(program, [path, pathext, reject])
          env.WhereIs(program, [path, pathext, reject])
          Searches for the specified executable program, returning the
          full path to the program or None.

          When called as a construction environment method, searches the
          paths in the path keyword argument, or if None (the default) the
          paths listed in the construction environment
          (env['ENV']['PATH']). The external environment's path list
          (os.environ['PATH']) is used as a fallback if the key
          env['ENV']['PATH'] does not exist.

          On Windows systems, searches for executable programs with any of
          the file extensions listed in the pathext keyword argument, or
          if None (the default) the pathname extensions listed in the
          construction environment (env['ENV']['PATHEXT']). The external
          environment's pathname extensions list (os.environ['PATHEXT'])
          is used as a fallback if the key env['ENV']['PATHEXT'] does not
          exist.

          When called as a global function, uses the external
          environment's path os.environ['PATH'] and path extensions
          os.environ['PATHEXT'], respectively, if path and pathext are
          None.

          Will not select any path name or names in the optional reject
          list.

Appendix E. Handling Common Tasks

   There is a common set of simple tasks that many build configurations
   rely on as they become more complex. Most build tools have special
   purpose constructs for performing these tasks, but since SConscript
   files are Python scripts, you can use more flexible built-in Python
   services to perform these tasks. This appendix lists a number of these
   tasks and how to implement them in Python and SCons.

   Example E.1. Wildcard globbing to create a list of filenames
files = Glob(wildcard)

   Example E.2. Filename extension substitution
import os.path
filename = os.path.splitext(filename)[0]+extension

   Example E.3. Appending a path prefix to a list of filenames
import os.path
filenames = [os.path.join(prefix, x) for x in filenames]

   Example E.4. Substituting a path prefix with another one
if filename.find(old_prefix) == 0:
    filename = filename.replace(old_prefix, new_prefix)

   Example E.5. Filtering a filename list to exclude/retain only a
   specific set of extensions
import os.path
filenames = [x for x in filenames if os.path.splitext(x)[1] in extensions]

   Example E.6. The "backtick function": run a shell command and capture
   the output
import subprocess
output = subprocess.check_output(command)

   Example E.7. Generating source code: how code can be generated and used
   by SCons

   The Copy builders here could be any arbitrary shell or python function
   that produces one or more files. This example shows how to create those
   files and use them in SCons.
#### SConstruct
env = Environment()
env.Append(CPPPATH = "#")

## Header example
env.Append(BUILDERS =
   {'Copy1' : Builder(action = 'cat < $SOURCE > $TARGET',
                      suffix='.h', src_suffix='.bar')})
env.Copy1('test.bar') # produces test.h from test.bar.
env.Program('app','main.cpp') # indirectly depends on test.bar

## Source file example
env.Append(BUILDERS =
  {'Copy2' : Builder(action = 'cat < $SOURCE > $TARGET',
                     suffix='.cpp', src_suffix='.bar2')})
foo = env.Copy2('foo.bar2') # produces foo.cpp from foo.bar2.
env.Program('app2',['main2.cpp'] + foo) # compiles main2.cpp and foo.cpp into ap
p2.

   Where main.cpp looks like this:
#include "test.h"


   produces this:
% scons -Q
cat < test.bar > test.h
cc -o app main.cpp
cat < foo.bar2 > foo.cpp
cc -o app2 main2.cpp foo.cpp
