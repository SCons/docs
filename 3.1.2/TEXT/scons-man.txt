Name

   scons -- a software construction tool

Synopsis

   scons [options...] [name=val...] [targets...]

DESCRIPTION

   The scons utility builds software (or other files) by determining which
   component pieces must be rebuilt and executing the necessary commands
   to rebuild them.

   By default, scons searches for a file named SConstruct, Sconstruct,
   sconstruct, SConstruct.py Sconstruct.py or sconstruct.py (in that
   order) in the current directory and reads its configuration from the
   first file found. An alternate file name may be specified via the -f
   option.

   The SConstruct file can specify subsidiary configuration files using
   the SConscript() function. By convention, these subsidiary files are
   named SConscript, although any name may be used. (Because of this
   naming convention, the term "SConscript files" is sometimes used to
   refer generically to all scons configuration files, regardless of
   actual file name.)

   The configuration files specify the target files to be built, and
   (optionally) the rules to build those targets. Reasonable default rules
   exist for building common software components (executable programs,
   object files, libraries), so that for most software projects, only the
   target and input files need be specified.

   Before reading the SConstruct file, scons looks for a directory named
   site_scons in various system directories (see below) and the directory
   containing the SConstruct file; for each of those dirs which exists,
   site_scons is prepended to sys.path, the file site_scons/site_init.py,
   is evaluated if it exists, and the directory site_scons/site_tools is
   prepended to the default toolpath if it exists. See the --no-site-dir
   and --site-dir options for more details.

   scons reads and executes the SConscript files as Python scripts, so you
   may use normal Python scripting capabilities (such as flow control,
   data manipulation, and imported Python libraries) to handle complicated
   build situations. scons, however, reads and executes all of the
   SConscript files before it begins building any targets. To make this
   obvious, scons prints the following messages about what it is doing:
$ scons foo.out
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets  ...
cp foo.in foo.out
scons: done building targets.
$

   The status messages (everything except the line that reads "cp foo.in
   foo.out") may be suppressed using the -Q option.

   scons does not automatically propagate the external environment used to
   execute scons to the commands used to build target files. This is so
   that builds will be guaranteed repeatable regardless of the environment
   variables set at the time scons is invoked. This also means that if the
   compiler or other commands that you want to use to build your target
   files are not in standard system locations, scons will not find them
   unless you explicitly set the PATH to include those locations. Whenever
   you create an scons construction environment, you can propagate the
   value of PATH from your external environment as follows:
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})

   Similarly, if the commands use external environment variables like
   PATH, HOME, JAVA_HOME, LANG, SHELL, TERM, etc., these variables can
   also be explicitly propagated:
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH': os.environ['PATH'],
                         'HOME': os.environ['HOME']})

   Or you may explicitly propagate the invoking user's complete external
   environment:
import os
env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)

   This comes at the expense of making your build dependent on the user's
   environment being set correctly, but it may be more convenient for many
   configurations.

   scons can scan known input files automatically for dependency
   information (for example, #include statements in C or C++ files) and
   will rebuild dependent files appropriately whenever any "included"
   input file changes. scons supports the ability to define new scanners
   for unknown input file types.

   scons knows how to fetch files automatically from SCCS or RCS
   subdirectories using SCCS, RCS or BitKeeper.

   scons is normally executed in a top-level directory containing a
   SConstruct file, optionally specifying as command-line arguments the
   target file or files to be built.

   By default, the command
scons

   will build all target files in or below the current directory. Explicit
   default targets (to be built when no targets are specified on the
   command line) may be defined in the SConscript file(s) using the
   Default() function, described below.

   Even when Default() targets are specified in the SConscript file(s),
   all target files in or below the current directory may be built by
   explicitly specifying the current directory (.) as a command-line
   target:
scons .

   Building all target files, including any files outside of the current
   directory, may be specified by supplying a command-line target of the
   root directory (on POSIX systems):
scons /

   or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets should be
   built (on Windows systems):
scons C:\ D:\

   To build only specific targets, supply them as command-line arguments:
scons foo bar

   in which case only the specified targets will be built (along with any
   derived files on which they depend).

   Specifying "cleanup" targets in SConscript files is not usually
   necessary. The -c flag removes all files necessary to build the
   specified target:
scons -c .

   to remove all target files, or:
scons -c build export

   to remove target files under build and export. Additional files or
   directories to remove can be specified using the Clean() function.
   Conversely, targets that would normally be removed by the -c invocation
   can be prevented from being removed by using the NoClean() function.

   A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by remaining at the
   top-level directory (where the SConstruct file lives) and specifying
   the subdirectory as the target to be built:
scons src/subdir

   or by changing directory and invoking scons with the -u option, which
   traverses up the directory hierarchy until it finds the SConstruct
   file, and then builds targets relatively to the current subdirectory:
cd src/subdir
scons -u .

   scons supports building multiple targets in parallel via a -j option
   that takes, as its argument, the number of simultaneous tasks that may
   be spawned:
scons -j 4

   builds four targets in parallel, for example.

   scons can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can be shared
   between multiple builds. When caching is enabled in a SConscript file,
   any target files built by scons will be copied to the cache. If an
   up-to-date target file is found in the cache, it will be retrieved from
   the cache instead of being rebuilt locally. Caching behavior may be
   disabled and controlled in other ways by the --cache-force,
   --cache-disable, --cache-readonly, and --cache-show command-line
   options. The --random option is useful to prevent multiple builds from
   trying to update the cache simultaneously.

   Values of variables to be passed to the SConscript file(s) may be
   specified on the command line:
scons debug=1 .

   These variables are available in SConscript files through the ARGUMENTS
   dictionary, and can be used in the SConscript file(s) to modify the
   build in any way:
if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')
else:
    env = Environment()

   The command-line variable arguments are also available in the ARGLIST
   list, indexed by their order on the command line. This allows you to
   process them in order rather than by name, if necessary. ARGLIST[0]
   returns a tuple containing (argname, argvalue). A Python exception is
   thrown if you try to access a list member that does not exist.

   scons requires either Python 2.7 or Python 3.5 or higher. There should
   be no other dependencies or requirements to run scons.

   By default, scons knows how to search for available programming tools
   on various systems. On Windows systems, scons searches in order for the
   Microsoft Visual C++ tools, the MinGW tool chain, the Intel compiler
   tools, and the PharLap ETS compiler. On OS/2 systems, scons searches in
   order for the OS/2 compiler, the GCC tool chain, and the Microsoft
   Visual C++ tools, On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP-UX, and Sun
   Solaris systems, scons searches for the native compiler tools (MIPSpro,
   Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively) and the GCC tool chain.
   On all other platforms, including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) platforms,
   scons searches in order for the GCC tool chain, the Microsoft Visual
   C++ tools, and the Intel compiler tools. You may, of course, override
   these default values by appropriate configuration of Environment
   construction variables.

OPTIONS

   In general, scons supports the same command-line options as GNU make,
   and many of those supported by cons.

   -b
          Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of make.

   -c, --clean, --remove
          Clean up by removing all target files for which a construction
          command is specified. Also remove any files or directories
          associated to the construction command using the Clean()
          function. Will not remove any targets specified by the NoClean()
          function.

   --cache-debug=file
          Print debug information about the CacheDir() derived-file
          caching to the specified file. If file is - (a hyphen), the
          debug information are printed to the standard output. The
          printed messages describe what signature file names are being
          looked for in, retrieved from, or written to the CacheDir()
          directory tree.

   --cache-disable, --no-cache
          Disable the derived-file caching specified by CacheDir(). scons
          will neither retrieve files from the cache nor copy files to the
          cache.

   --cache-force, --cache-populate
          When using CacheDir(), populate a cache by copying any
          already-existing, up-to-date derived files to the cache, in
          addition to files built by this invocation. This is useful to
          populate a new cache with all the current derived files, or to
          add to the cache any derived files recently built with caching
          disabled via the --cache-disable option.

   --cache-readonly
          Use the cache (if enabled) for reading, but do not not update
          the cache with changed files.

   --cache-show
          When using CacheDir() and retrieving a derived file from the
          cache, show the command that would have been executed to build
          the file, instead of the usual report, "Retrieved `file' from
          cache." This will produce consistent output for build logs,
          regardless of whether a target file was rebuilt or retrieved
          from the cache.

   --config=mode
          This specifies how the Configure call should use or generate the
          results of configuration tests. The option should be specified
          from among the following choices:

   --config=auto
          scons will use its normal dependency mechanisms to decide if a
          test must be rebuilt or not. This saves time by not running the
          same configuration tests every time you invoke scons, but will
          overlook changes in system header files or external commands
          (such as compilers) if you don't specify those dependecies
          explicitly. This is the default behavior.

   --config=force
          If this option is specified, all configuration tests will be
          re-run regardless of whether the cached results are out of date.
          This can be used to explicitly force the configuration tests to
          be updated in response to an otherwise unconfigured change in a
          system header file or compiler.

   --config=cache
          If this option is specified, no configuration tests will be
          rerun and all results will be taken from cache. Note that scons
          will still consider it an error if --config=cache is specified
          and a necessary test does not yet have any results in the cache.

   -C directory, --directory=directory
          Change to the specified directory before searching for the
          SConstruct, Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py Sconstruct.py
          or sconstruct.py file, or doing anything else. Multiple -C
          options are interpreted relative to the previous one, and the
          right-most -C option wins. (This option is nearly equivalent to
          -f directory/SConstruct, except that it will search for
          SConstruct, Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py Sconstruct.py
          or sconstruct.py in the specified directory.)

   -D
          Works exactly the same way as the -u option except for the way
          default targets are handled. When this option is used and no
          targets are specified on the command line, all default targets
          are built, whether or not they are below the current directory.

   --debug=type[,type...]
          Debug the build process. type specifies the kind of debugging
          info to emit. Multiple types may be specified, separated by
          commas. The following entries show the recognized types:

   --debug=action-timestamps
          Prints additional time profiling information. For each command,
          shows the absolute start and end times. This may be useful in
          debugging parallel builds. Implies the --debug=time option.

          Since scons 3.1.

   --debug=count
          Print how many objects are created of the various classes used
          internally by SCons before and after reading the SConscript
          files and before and after building targets. This is not
          supported when SCons is executed with the Python -O (optimized)
          option or when the SCons modules have been compiled with
          optimization (that is, when executing from *.pyo files).

   --debug=duplicate
          Print a line for each unlink/relink (or copy) of a variant file
          from its source file. Includes debugging info for unlinking
          stale variant files, as well as unlinking old targets before
          building them.

   --debug=explain
          Print an explanation of precisely why scons is deciding to
          (re-)build any targets. (Note: this does not print anything for
          targets that are not rebuilt.)

   --debug=findlibs
          Instruct the scanner that searches for libraries to print a
          message about each potential library name it is searching for,
          and about the actual libraries it finds.

   --debug=includes
          Print the include tree after each top-level target is built.
          This is generally used to find out what files are included by
          the sources of a given derived file:

$ scons --debug=includes foo.o

   --debug=memoizer
          Prints a summary of hits and misses using the Memoizer, an
          internal subsystem that counts how often SCons uses cached
          values in memory instead of recomputing them each time they're
          needed.

   --debug=memory
          Prints how much memory SCons uses before and after reading the
          SConscript files and before and after building targets.

   --debug=objects
          Prints a list of the various objects of the various classes used
          internally by SCons.

   --debug=pdb
          Re-run SCons under the control of the pdb Python debugger.

   --debug=prepare
          Print a line each time any target (internal or external) is
          prepared for building. scons prints this for each target it
          considers, even if that target is up to date (see also
          --debug=explain). This can help debug problems with targets that
          aren't being built; it shows whether scons is at least
          considering them or not.

   --debug=presub
          Print the raw command line used to build each target before the
          construction environment variables are substituted. Also shows
          which targets are being built by this command. Output looks
          something like this:

$ scons --debug=presub
Building myprog.o with action(s):
  $SHCC $SHCFLAGS $SHCCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES
...

   --debug=stacktrace
          Prints an internal Python stack trace when encountering an
          otherwise unexplained error.

   --debug=time
          Prints various time profiling information:

          + The time spent executing each individual build command
          + The total build time (time SCons ran from beginning to end)
          + The total time spent reading and executing SConscript files
          + The total time spent SCons itself spend running (that is, not
            counting reading and executing SConscript files)
          + The total time spent executing all build commands
          + The elapsed wall-clock time spent executing those build
            commands
          + The time spent processing each file passed to the SConscript()
            function

          (When scons is executed without the -j option, the elapsed
          wall-clock time will typically be slightly longer than the total
          time spent executing all the build commands, due to the SCons
          processing that takes place in between executing each command.
          When scons is executed with the -j option, and your build
          configuration allows good parallelization, the elapsed
          wall-clock time should be significantly smaller than the total
          time spent executing all the build commands, since multiple
          build commands and intervening SCons processing should take
          place in parallel.)

   --diskcheck=types
          Enable specific checks for whether or not there is a file on
          disk where the SCons configuration expects a directory (or vice
          versa), and whether or not RCS or SCCS sources exist when
          searching for source and include files. The types argument can
          be set to: all, to enable all checks explicitly (the default
          behavior); none, to disable all such checks; match, to check
          that files and directories on disk match SCons' expected
          configuration; rcs, to check for the existence of an RCS source
          for any missing source or include files; sccs, to check for the
          existence of an SCCS source for any missing source or include
          files. Multiple checks can be specified separated by commas; for
          example, --diskcheck=sccs,rcs would still check for SCCS and RCS
          sources, but disable the check for on-disk matches of files and
          directories. Disabling some or all of these checks can provide a
          performance boost for large configurations, or when the
          configuration will check for files and/or directories across
          networked or shared file systems, at the slight increased risk
          of an incorrect build or of not handling errors gracefully (if
          include files really should be found in SCCS or RCS, for
          example, or if a file really does exist where the SCons
          configuration expects a directory).

   --duplicate=ORDER
          There are three ways to duplicate files in a build tree: hard
          links, soft (symbolic) links and copies. The default behaviour
          of SCons is to prefer hard links to soft links to copies. You
          can specify different behaviours with this option. ORDER must be
          one of hard-soft-copy (the default), soft-hard-copy, hard-copy,
          soft-copy or copy. SCons will attempt to duplicate files using
          the mechanisms in the specified order.

   --enable-virtualenv
          Import virtualenv-related variables to SCons.

   -f file, --file=file, --makefile=file, --sconstruct=file
          Use file as the initial SConscript file. Multiple -f options may
          be specified, in which case scons will read all of the specified
          files.

   -h, --help
          Print a local help message for this build, if one is defined in
          the SConscript file(s), plus a line that describes the -H option
          for command-line option help. If no local help message is
          defined, prints the standard help message about command-line
          options. Exits after displaying the appropriate message.

   -H, --help-options
          Print the standard help message about command-line options and
          exit.

   -i, --ignore-errors
          Ignore all errors from commands executed to rebuild files.

   -I directory, --include-dir=directory
          Specifies a directory to search for imported Python modules. If
          several -I options are used, the directories are searched in the
          order specified.

   --ignore-virtualenv
          Suppress importing virtualenv-related variables to SCons.

   --implicit-cache
          Cache implicit dependencies. This causes scons to use the
          implicit (scanned) dependencies from the last time it was run
          instead of scanning the files for implicit dependencies. This
          can significantly speed up SCons, but with the following
          limitations:

   scons will not detect changes to implicit dependency search paths (e.g.
   CPPPATH, LIBPATH) that would ordinarily cause different versions of
   same-named files to be used.

   scons will miss changes in the implicit dependencies in cases where a
   new implicit dependency is added earlier in the implicit dependency
   search path (e.g. CPPPATH, LIBPATH) than a current implicit dependency
   with the same name.

   --implicit-deps-changed
          Forces SCons to ignore the cached implicit dependencies. This
          causes the implicit dependencies to be rescanned and recached.
          This implies --implicit-cache.

   --implicit-deps-unchanged
          Force SCons to ignore changes in the implicit dependencies. This
          causes cached implicit dependencies to always be used. This
          implies --implicit-cache.

   --install-sandbox=path
          When using the Install functions, prepend path to the
          installation paths such that all installed files will be placed
          underneath path.

   --interactive
          Starts SCons in interactive mode. The SConscript files are read
          once and a scons>>> prompt is printed. Targets may now be
          rebuilt by typing commands at interactive prompt without having
          to re-read the SConscript files and re-initialize the dependency
          graph from scratch.

          SCons interactive mode supports the following commands:

        build[OPTIONS] [TARGETS] ...
                Builds the specified TARGETS (and their dependencies) with
                the specified SCons command-line OPTIONS. b and scons are
                synonyms.

                The following SCons command-line options affect the build
                command:

--cache-debug=FILE
--cache-disable, --no-cache
--cache-force, --cache-populate
--cache-readonly
--cache-show
--debug=TYPE
-i, --ignore-errors
-j N, --jobs=N
-k, --keep-going
-n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
-Q
-s, --silent, --quiet
--taskmastertrace=FILE
--tree=OPTIONS

     Any other SCons command-line options that are specified do not cause
     errors but have no effect on the build command (mainly because they
     affect how the SConscript files are read, which only happens once at
     the beginning of interactive mode).

        clean[OPTIONS] [TARGETS] ...
                Cleans the specified TARGETS (and their dependencies) with
                the specified options. c is a synonym. This command is
                itself a synonym for build --clean

        exit
                Exits SCons interactive mode. You can also exit by
                terminating input (CTRL+D on UNIX or Linux systems, CTRL+Z
                on Windows systems).

        help[COMMAND]
                Provides a help message about the commands available in
                SCons interactive mode. If COMMAND is specified, h and ?
                are synonyms.

        shell[COMMANDLINE]
                Executes the specified COMMANDLINE in a subshell. If no
                COMMANDLINE is specified, executes the interactive command
                interpreter specified in the SHELL environment variable
                (on UNIX and Linux systems) or the COMSPEC environment
                variable (on Windows systems). sh and ! are synonyms.

        version
                Prints SCons version information.

   An empty line repeats the last typed command. Command-line editing can
   be used if the readline module is available.
$ scons --interactive
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons>>> build -n prog
scons>>> exit

   -j N, --jobs=N
          Specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run simultaneously.
          If there is more than one -j option, the last one is effective.

   -k, --keep-going
          Continue as much as possible after an error. The target that
          failed and those that depend on it will not be remade, but other
          targets specified on the command line will still be processed.

   -m
          Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of make.

   --max-drift=SECONDS
          Set the maximum expected drift in the modification time of files
          to SECONDS. This value determines how long a file must be
          unmodified before its cached content signature will be used
          instead of calculating a new content signature (MD5 checksum) of
          the file's contents. The default value is 2 days, which means a
          file must have a modification time of at least two days ago in
          order to have its cached content signature used. A negative
          value means to never cache the content signature and to ignore
          the cached value if there already is one. A value of 0 means to
          always use the cached signature, no matter how old the file is.

   --md5-chunksize=KILOBYTES
          Set the block size used to compute MD5 signatures to KILOBYTES.
          This value determines the size of the chunks which are read in
          at once when computing MD5 signatures. Files below that size are
          fully stored in memory before performing the signature
          computation while bigger files are read in block-by-block. A
          huge block-size leads to high memory consumption while a very
          small block-size slows down the build considerably.

          The default value is to use a chunk size of 64 kilobytes, which
          should be appropriate for most uses.

   -n, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
          No execute. Print the commands that would be executed to build
          any out-of-date target files, but do not execute the commands.

   --no-site-dir
          Prevents the automatic addition of the standard site_scons dirs
          to sys.path. Also prevents loading the site_scons/site_init.py
          modules if they exist, and prevents adding their
          site_scons/site_tools dirs to the toolpath.

   --profile=file
          Run SCons under the Python profiler and save the results in the
          specified file. The results may be analyzed using the Python
          pstats module.

   -q, --question
          Do not run any commands, or print anything. Just return an exit
          status that is zero if the specified targets are already up to
          date, non-zero otherwise.

   -Q
          Quiets SCons status messages about reading SConscript files,
          building targets and entering directories. Commands that are
          executed to rebuild target files are still printed.

   --random
          Build dependencies in a random order. This is useful when
          building multiple trees simultaneously with caching enabled, to
          prevent multiple builds from simultaneously trying to build or
          retrieve the same target files.

   -s, --silent, --quiet
          Silent. Do not print commands that are executed to rebuild
          target files. Also suppresses SCons status messages.

   -S, --no-keep-going, --stop
          Ignored for compatibility with GNU make.

   --site-dir=dir
          Uses the named dir as the site dir rather than the default
          site_scons dirs. This dir will get prepended to sys.path, the
          module dir/site_init.py will get loaded if it exists, and
          dir/site_tools will get added to the default toolpath.

          The default set of site_scons dirs used when --site-dir is not
          specified depends on the system platform, as follows. Note that
          the directories are examined in the order given, from most
          generic to most specific, so the last-executed site_init.py file
          is the most specific one (which gives it the chance to override
          everything else), and the dirs are prepended to the paths, again
          so the last dir examined comes first in the resulting path.

   --stack-size=KILOBYTES
          Set the size stack used to run threads to KILOBYTES. This value
          determines the stack size of the threads used to run jobs. These
          are the threads that execute the actions of the builders for the
          nodes that are out-of-date. Note that this option has no effect
          unless the num_jobs option, which corresponds to -j and --jobs,
          is larger than one. Using a stack size that is too small may
          cause stack overflow errors. This usually shows up as
          segmentation faults that cause scons to abort before building
          anything. Using a stack size that is too large will cause scons
          to use more memory than required and may slow down the entire
          build process.

          The default value is to use a stack size of 256 kilobytes, which
          should be appropriate for most uses. You should not need to
          increase this value unless you encounter stack overflow errors.

   -t, --touch
          Ignored for compatibility with GNU make. (Touching a file to
          make it appear up-to-date is unnecessary when using scons.)

   --taskmastertrace=file
          Prints trace information to the specified file about how the
          internal Taskmaster object evaluates and controls the order in
          which Nodes are built. A file name of - may be used to specify
          the standard output.

   -tree=options
          Prints a tree of the dependencies after each top-level target is
          built. This prints out some or all of the tree, in various
          formats, depending on the options specified:

   --tree=all
          Print the entire dependency tree after each top-level target is
          built. This prints out the complete dependency tree, including
          implicit dependencies and ignored dependencies.

   --tree=derived
          Restricts the tree output to only derived (target) files, not
          source files.

   --tree=status
          Prints status information for each displayed node.

   --tree=prune
          Prunes the tree to avoid repeating dependency information for
          nodes that have already been displayed. Any node that has
          already been displayed will have its name printed in [square
          brackets], as an indication that the dependencies for that node
          can be found by searching for the relevant output higher up in
          the tree.

   Multiple options may be specified, separated by commas:
# Prints only derived files, with status information:
scons --tree=derived,status

# Prints all dependencies of target, with status information
# and pruning dependencies of already-visited Nodes:
scons --tree=all,prune,status target

   -u, --up, --search-up
          Walks up the directory structure until an SConstruct ,
          Sconstruct , sconstruct , SConstruct.py Sconstruct.py or
          sconstruct.py file is found, and uses that as the top of the
          directory tree. If no targets are specified on the command line,
          only targets at or below the current directory will be built.

   -U
          Works exactly the same way as the -u option except for the way
          default targets are handled. When this option is used and no
          targets are specified on the command line, all default targets
          that are defined in the SConscript(s) in the current directory
          are built, regardless of what directory the resultant targets
          end up in.

   -v, --version
          Print the scons version, copyright information, list of authors,
          and any other relevant information. Then exit.

   -w, --print-directory
          Print a message containing the working directory before and
          after other processing.

   --no-print-directory
          Turn off -w, even if it was turned on implicitly.

   --warn=type, --warn=no-type
          Enable or disable warnings. type specifies the type of warnings
          to be enabled or disabled:

   --warn=all, --warn=no-all
          Enables or disables all warnings.

   --warn=cache-version, --warn=no-cache-version
          Enables or disables warnings about the cache directory not using
          the latest configuration information CacheDir(). These warnings
          are enabled by default.

   --warn=cache-write-error, --warn=no-cache-write-error
          Enables or disables warnings about errors trying to write a copy
          of a built file to a specified CacheDir(). These warnings are
          disabled by default.

   --warn=corrupt-sconsign, --warn=no-corrupt-sconsign
          Enables or disables warnings about unfamiliar signature data in
          .sconsign files. These warnings are enabled by default.

   --warn=dependency, --warn=no-dependency
          Enables or disables warnings about dependencies. These warnings
          are disabled by default.

   --warn=deprecated, --warn=no-deprecated
          Enables or disables all warnings about use of currently
          deprecated features. These warnings are enabled by default. Note
          that the --warn=no-deprecated option does not disable warnings
          about absolutely all deprecated features. Warnings for some
          deprecated features that have already been through several
          releases with deprecation warnings may be mandatory for a
          release or two before they are officially no longer supported by
          SCons. Warnings for some specific deprecated features may be
          enabled or disabled individually; see below.

   --warn=duplicate-environment, --warn=no-duplicate-environment
          Enables or disables warnings about attempts to specify a build
          of a target with two different construction environments that
          use the same action. These warnings are enabled by default.

   --warn=fortran-cxx-mix, --warn=no-fortran-cxx-mix
          Enables or disables the specific warning about linking Fortran
          and C++ object files in a single executable, which can yield
          unpredictable behavior with some compilers.

   --warn=future-deprecated, --warn=no-future-deprecated
          Enables or disables warnings about features that will be
          deprecated in the future. These warnings are disabled by
          default. Enabling this warning is especially recommended for
          projects that redistribute SCons configurations for other users
          to build, so that the project can be warned as soon as possible
          about to-be-deprecated features that may require changes to the
          configuration.

   --warn=link, --warn=no-link
          Enables or disables warnings about link steps.

   --warn=misleading-keywords, --warn=no-misleading-keywords
          Enables or disables warnings about use of the misspelled
          keywords targets and sources when calling Builders. (Note the
          last s characters, the correct spellings are target and source.)
          These warnings are enabled by default.

   --warn=missing-sconscript, --warn=no-missing-sconscript
          Enables or disables warnings about missing SConscript files.
          These warnings are enabled by default.

   --warn=no-object-count, --warn=no-no-object-count
          Enables or disables warnings about the --debug=object feature
          not working when scons is run with the Python -O option or from
          optimized Python (.pyo) modules.

   --warn=no-parallel-support, --warn=no-no-parallel-support
          Enables or disables warnings about the version of Python not
          being able to support parallel builds when the -j option is
          used. These warnings are enabled by default.

   --warn=python-version, --warn=no-python-version
          Enables or disables the warning about running SCons with a
          deprecated version of Python. These warnings are enabled by
          default.

   --warn=reserved-variable, --warn=no-reserved-variable
          Enables or disables warnings about attempts to set the reserved
          construction variable names CHANGED_SOURCES, CHANGED_TARGETS,
          TARGET, TARGETS, SOURCE, SOURCES, UNCHANGED_SOURCES or
          UNCHANGED_TARGETS. These warnings are disabled by default.

   --warn=stack-size, --warn=no-stack-size
          Enables or disables warnings about requests to set the stack
          size that could not be honored. These warnings are enabled by
          default.

   --warn=target_not_build, --warn=no-target_not_built
          Enables or disables warnings about a build rule not building the
          expected targets. These warnings are not currently enabled by
          default.

   -Y repository, --repository=repository, --srcdir=repository
          Search the specified repository for any input and target files
          not found in the local directory hierarchy. Multiple -Y options
          may be specified, in which case the repositories are searched in
          the order specified.

CONFIGURATION FILE REFERENCE

Construction Environments

   A construction environment is the basic means by which the SConscript
   files communicate build information to scons. A new construction
   environment is created using the Environment function:
env = Environment()

   Variables, called construction variables, may be set in a construction
   environment either by specifying them as keywords when the object is
   created or by assigning them a value after the object is created:
env = Environment(FOO = 'foo')
env['BAR'] = 'bar'

   As a convenience, construction variables may also be set or modified by
   the parse_flags keyword argument, which applies the [1]env.MergeFlags
   method (described below) to the argument value after all other
   processing is completed. This is useful either if the exact content of
   the flags is unknown (for example, read from a control file) or if the
   flags are distributed to a number of construction variables.
env = Environment(parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

   This example adds 'include' to CPPPATH, 'EBUG' to CPPDEFINES, and 'm'
   to LIBS.

   By default, a new construction environment is initialized with a set of
   builder methods and construction variables that are appropriate for the
   current platform. An optional platform keyword argument may be used to
   specify that an environment should be initialized for a different
   platform:
env = Environment(platform = 'cygwin')
env = Environment(platform = 'os2')
env = Environment(platform = 'posix')
env = Environment(platform = 'win32')

   Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate construction
   variables in the environment to use and generate file names with
   prefixes and suffixes appropriate for the platform.

   Note that the win32 platform adds the SystemDrive and SystemRoot
   variables from the user's external environment to the construction
   environment's ENV dictionary. This is so that any executed commands
   that use sockets to connect with other systems (such as fetching source
   files from external CVS repository specifications like
   :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/scons) will work on
   Windows systems.

   The platform argument may be function or callable object, in which case
   the Environment() method will call the specified argument to update the
   new construction environment:
def my_platform(env):
    env['VAR'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(platform = my_platform)

   Additionally, a specific set of tools with which to initialize the
   environment may be specified using the optional keyword argument tools:
env = Environment(tools=['msvc', 'lex'])

   The tools argument overrides the tool list, it does not add to it, so
   be sure to include all the tools you need. For example if you are
   building a c/c++ program you must add a tool for both compiler and
   linker, as in tools=['clang', 'link']. The tool name 'default' can be
   used to retain the default list.

   Non-built-in tools may be specified using the optional toolpath keyword
   argument:
env = Environment(tools=['default', 'foo'], toolpath=['tools'])

   This looks for a tool specification in tools/foo.py as well as using
   the ordinary default tools for the platform.

   A tool specification must include two functions: generate(env, **kw)
   and exists(env). The generate function modifies the environment
   referenced by env to set up variables so that the tool can be executed;
   it may use any keyword arguments that the user supplies in kw (see
   below) to vary its initialization. The exists function should return a
   true value if the tool is available.

   Tools in the toolpath are used before any of the built-in ones. For
   example, adding gcc.py to the toolpath would override the built-in gcc
   tool. Also note that the toolpath is stored in the environment for use
   by later calls to Clone() and Tool() methods:
base = Environment(toolpath=['custom_path'])
derived = base.Clone(tools=['custom_tool'])
derived.CustomBuilder()

   The elements of the tools list may also be functions or callable
   objects, in which case the Environment() method will call the specified
   elements to update the new construction environment:
def my_tool(env):
    env['XYZZY'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(tools = [my_tool])

   The individual elements of the tools list may also themselves be
   two-element lists of the form (toolname, kw_dict). SCons searches for
   the toolname specification file as described above, and passes kw_dict,
   which must be a dictionary, as keyword arguments to the tool's generate
   function. The generate function can use the arguments to modify the
   tool's behavior by setting up the environment in different ways or
   otherwise changing its initialization.
# in tools/my_tool.py:
def generate(env, **kw):
  # Sets MY_TOOL to the value of keyword argument 'arg1' or 1.
  env['MY_TOOL'] = kw.get('arg1', '1')

def exists(env):
  return True

# in SConstruct:
env = Environment(tools=['default', ('my_tool', {'arg1': 'abc'})],
                  toolpath=['tools'])

   The tool definition (i.e. my_tool()) can use the PLATFORM variable from
   the environment it receives to customize the tool for different
   platforms.

   If no tool list is specified, then SCons will auto-detect the installed
   tools using the PATH variable in the ENV construction variable and the
   platform name when the Environment is constructed. Changing the PATH
   variable after the Environment is constructed will not cause the tools
   to be redetected.

   One feature now present within Scons is the ability to have nested
   tools. Tools which can be located within a subdirectory in the
   toolpath. With a nested tool name the dot represents a directory
   seperator
# namespaced builder
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ, tools=['SubDir1.SubDir2.SomeTool'])
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

# Search Paths
# SCons\Tool\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool.py
# SCons\Tool\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool\__init__.py
# .\site_scons\site_tools\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool.py
# .\site_scons\site_tools\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool\__init__.py

   default
          Sets construction variables for a default list of Tool modules.
          Use default in the tools list to retain the original defaults,
          since the tools parameter is treated as a literal statement of
          the tools to be made available in that construction environment,
          not an addition.

          The list of tools selected by default is not static, but is
          dependent both on the platform and on the software installed on
          the platform. Some tools will not initialize if an underlying
          command is not found, and some tools are selected from a list of
          choices on a first-found basis. The finished tool list can be
          examined by inspecting the TOOLS construction variable in the
          construction environment.

          On all platforms, all tools from the following list are selected
          whose respective conditions are met: filesystem, wix, lex, yacc,
          rpcgen, swig, jar, javac, javah, rmic, dvipdf, dvips, gs, tex,
          latex, pdflatex, pdftex, tar, zip, textfile.

          On Linux systems, the default tools list selects (first-found):
          a C compiler from gcc, intelc, icc, cc; a C++ compiler from g++,
          intelc, icc, cxx; an assembler from gas, nasm, masm; a linker
          from gnulink, ilink; a Fortran compiler from gfortran, g77,
          ifort, ifl, f95, f90, f77; and a static archiver 'ar'. It also
          selects all found from the list m4, rpm.

          On Windows systems, the default tools list selects
          (first-found): a C compiler from msvc, mingw, gcc, intelc, icl,
          icc, cc, bcc32; a C++ compiler from msvc, intelc, icc, g++, cxx,
          bcc32; an assembler from masm, nasm, gas, 386asm; a linker from
          mslink, gnulink, ilink, linkloc, ilink32; a Fortran compiler
          from gfortran, g77, ifl, cvf, f95, f90, fortran; and a static
          archiver from mslib, ar, tlib; It also selects all found from
          the list msvs, midl.

          On MacOS systems, the default tools list selects (first-found):
          a C compiler from gcc, cc; a C++ compiler from g++, cxx; an
          assembler 'as'; a linker from applelink, gnulink; a Fortran
          compiler from gfortran, f95, f90, g77; and a static archiver ar.
          It also selects all found from the list m4, rpm.

          Default lists for other platforms can be found by examining the
          scons source code (see SCons/Tool/__init__.py).

   dmd
          Sets construction variables for D language compiler DMD.

          Sets: [140]$DC, [141]$DCOM, [142]$DDEBUG, [143]$DDEBUGPREFIX,

   docbook
          This tool tries to make working with Docbook in SCons a little
          easier. It provides several toolchains for creating different
          output formats, like HTML or PDF. Contained in the package is a
          distribution of the Docbook XSL stylesheets as of version
          1.76.1. As long as you don't specify your own stylesheets for
          customization, these official versions are picked as
          default...which should reduce the inevitable setup hassles for
          you.

          Implicit dependencies to images and XIncludes are detected
          automatically if you meet the HTML requirements. The additional
          stylesheet utils/xmldepend.xsl by Paul DuBois is used for this
          purpose.

          Note, that there is no support for XML catalog resolving
          offered! This tool calls the XSLT processors and PDF renderers
          with the stylesheets you specified, that's it. The rest lies in
          your hands and you still have to know what you're doing when
          resolving names via a catalog.

          For activating the tool "docbook", you have to add its name to
          the Environment constructor, like this

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])

          On its startup, the Docbook tool tries to find a required
          xsltproc processor, and a PDF renderer, e.g. fop. So make sure
          that these are added to your system's environment PATH and can
          be called directly, without specifying their full path.

          For the most basic processing of Docbook to HTML, you need to
          have installed

          + the Python lxml binding to libxml2, or
          + the direct Python bindings for libxml2/libxslt, or
          + a standalone XSLT processor, currently detected are xsltproc,
            saxon, saxon-xslt and xalan.

          Rendering to PDF requires you to have one of the applications
          fop or xep installed.

          Creating a HTML or PDF document is very simple and
          straightforward. Say

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')
env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          to get both outputs from your XML source manual.xml. As a
          shortcut, you can give the stem of the filenames alone, like
          this:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual')
env.DocbookPdf('manual')

          and get the same result. Target and source lists are also
          supported:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml(['manual.html','reference.html'], ['manual.xml','reference.xml']
)

          or even

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml(['manual','reference'])

Important

          Whenever you leave out the list of sources, you may not specify
          a file extension! The Tool uses the given names as file stems,
          and adds the suffixes for target and source files accordingly.

          The rules given above are valid for the Builders
          [178]DocbookHtml, [179]DocbookPdf, [180]DocbookEpub,
          [181]DocbookSlidesPdf and [182]DocbookXInclude. For the
          [183]DocbookMan transformation you can specify a target name,
          but the actual output names are automatically set from the
          refname entries in your XML source.

          The Builders [184]DocbookHtmlChunked, [185]DocbookHtmlhelp and
          [186]DocbookSlidesHtml are special, in that:

         1. they create a large set of files, where the exact names and
            their number depend on the content of the source file, and
         2. the main target is always named index.html, i.e. the output
            name for the XSL transformation is not picked up by the
            stylesheets.

          As a result, there is simply no use in specifying a target HTML
          name. So the basic syntax for these builders is always:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

          If you want to use a specific XSL file, you can set the
          additional xsl parameter to your Builder call as follows:

env.DocbookHtml('other.html', 'manual.xml', xsl='html.xsl')

          Since this may get tedious if you always use the same local
          naming for your customized XSL files, e.g. html.xsl for HTML and
          pdf.xsl for PDF output, a set of variables for setting the
          default XSL name is provided. These are:

DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLCHUNKED
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLHELP
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_EPUB
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_MAN
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESPDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESHTML

          and you can set them when constructing your environment:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'],
                  DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML='html.xsl',
                  DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF='pdf.xsl')
env.DocbookHtml('manual') # now uses html.xsl

   gettext
          This is actually a toolset, which supports internationalization
          and localization of software being constructed with SCons. The
          toolset loads following tools:

          + [353]xgettext - to extract internationalized messages from
            source code to POT file(s),
          + [354]msginit - may be optionally used to initialize PO files,
          + [355]msgmerge - to update PO files, that already contain
            translated messages,
          + [356]msgfmt - to compile textual PO file to binary installable
            MO file.

          When you enable gettext, it internally loads all abovementioned
          tools, so you're encouraged to see their individual
          documentation.

          Each of the above tools provides its own builder(s) which may be
          used to perform particular activities related to software
          internationalization. You may be however interested in top-level
          builder Translate described few paragraphs later.

          To use gettext tools add 'gettext' tool to your environment:

  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'gettext'] )

Builder Methods

   You tell scons what to build by calling Builders, functions which know
   to take a particular action when given files of a particular type to
   produce a particular result type. scons defines a number of builders,
   and you can also write your own. Builders are attached to a
   construction environment as methods, and the available builder methods
   are listed as key-value pairs in the BUILDERS attribute of the
   construction environment. The available builders can be displayed like
   this for debugging purposes:
print("Builders:", list(env['BUILDERS']))

   Builder methods always take two arguments: target (a target or a list
   of targets to be built) and source (a source or list of sources to be
   used as input when building), although in some circumstances, the
   target argument can actually be omitted (see below). Builder methods
   also take a variety of keyword arguments, described below.

   Because long lists of file names can lead to a lot of quoting, scons
   supplies a Split global function and a same-named environment method
   that split a single string into a list, separated on strings of
   white-space characters. (These are similar to the Python string split
   method, but work even if the input isn't a string.)

   The target and source arguments to a builder method can be specified
   either as positional arguments, in which case the target comes first,
   or as keyword arguments, using target= and source=. The following are
   equivalent examples of calling the Program builder method:
env.Program('bar', ['bar.c', 'foo.c'])
env.Program('bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(source=['bar.c', 'foo.c'], target='bar')
env.Program(target='bar', source=Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(target='bar', source=env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', source='bar.c foo.c'.split())

   Python follows the POSIX pathname convention for path strings: if a
   string begins with the operating system pathname separator (on Windows
   both the slash and backslash separator work, and any leading drive
   specifier is ignored for the determination) it is considered an
   absolute path, otherwise it is a relative path. If the path string
   contains no separator characters, it is searched for as a file in the
   current directory. If it contains separator characters, the search
   follows down from the starting point, which is the top of the directory
   tree for an absolute path and the current directory for a relative
   path.

   scons recognizes a third way to specify path strings: if the string
   begins with the # character it is top-relative - it works like a
   relative path but the search follows down from the directory containing
   the top-level SConstruct rather than from the current directory (the #
   is allowed to be followed by a pathname separator, which is ignored if
   found in that position). Top-relative paths only work in places where
   scons will interpret the path (see some examples below). To be used in
   other contexts the string will need to be converted to a relative or
   absolute path first.

   Target and source pathnames can be absolute, relative, or top-relative.
   Relative pathnames are searched considering the directory of the
   SConscript file currently being processed as the "current directory".

   Examples:
# The comments describing the targets that will be built
# assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the
# a subdirectory named "subdir".

# Builds the program "subdir/foo" from "subdir/foo.c":
env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

# Builds the program "/tmp/bar" from "subdir/bar.c":
env.Program('/tmp/bar', 'bar.c')

# An initial '#' or '#/' are equivalent; the following
# calls build the programs "foo" and "bar" (in the
# top-level SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c" and
# "subdir/bar.c", respectively:
env.Program('#foo', 'foo.c')
env.Program('#/bar', 'bar.c')

# Builds the program "other/foo" (relative to the top-level
# SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c":
env.Program('#other/foo', 'foo.c')

   When the target shares the same base name as the source and only the
   suffix varies, and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the
   target file type, then the target argument may be omitted completely,
   and scons will deduce the target file name from the source file name.
   The following examples all build the executable program bar (on POSIX
   systems) or bar.exe (on Windows systems) from the bar.c source file:
env.Program(target='bar', source='bar.c')
env.Program('bar', source='bar.c')
env.Program(source='bar.c')
env.Program('bar.c')

   As a convenience, a srcdir keyword argument may be specified when
   calling a Builder. When specified, all source file strings that are not
   absolute paths or top-relative paths will be interpreted relative to
   the specified srcdir. The following example will build the build/prog
   (or build/prog.exe on Windows) program from the files src/f1.c and
   src/f2.c:
env.Program('build/prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c'], srcdir='src')

   It is possible to override (replace or add) construction variables when
   calling a builder method by passing them as keyword arguments. These
   overrides will only be in effect when building that target, and will
   not affect other parts of the build. For example, if you want to
   specify some libraries needed by just one program:
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])

   or generate a shared library with a non-standard suffix:
env.SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp',
                  SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx',
                  LIBSUFFIXES=['.ocx'])

   (Note that both the $SHLIBSUFFIX and $LIBSUFFIXES variables must be set
   if you want SCons to search automatically for dependencies on the
   non-standard library names; see the descriptions of these variables,
   below, for more information.)

   It is also possible to use the parse_flags keyword argument in an
   override, to merge command-line style arguments into the appropriate
   construction variables (see [935]env.MergeFlags).
env = Program('hello', 'hello.c', parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

   This example adds 'include' to CPPPATH, 'EBUG' to CPPDEFINES, and 'm'
   to LIBS.

   Although the builder methods defined by scons are, in fact, methods of
   a construction environment object, they may also be called without an
   explicit environment:
Program('hello', 'hello.c')
SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp')

   In this case, the methods are called internally using a default
   construction environment that consists of the tools and values that
   scons has determined are appropriate for the local system.

   Builder methods that can be called without an explicit environment may
   be called from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript
   file by adding the following to the Python module:
from SCons.Script import *

   All builder methods return a list-like object containing Nodes that
   will be built. A Node is an internal SCons object which represents
   build targets or sources.

   The returned Node-list object can be passed to other builder methods as
   source(s) or passed to any SCons function or method where a filename
   would normally be accepted. For example, if it were necessary to add a
   specific preprocessor define when compiling one specific object file:
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
env.Program(source = ['foo.c', bar_obj_list, 'main.c'])

   Using a Node in this way makes for a more portable build by avoiding
   having to specify a platform-specific object suffix when calling the
   Program builder method.

   Note that builder calls will automatically "flatten" the source and
   target file lists, so it's all right to have the bar_obj_list returned
   by the StaticObject call in the middle of the source file list. If you
   need to manipulate a list of lists returned by builders directly using
   Python, you can either build the list by hand:
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = ['begin.o'] + foo + ['middle.o'] + bar + ['end.o']
for object in objects:
    print(str(object))

   Or you can use the Flatten function supplied by scons to create a list
   containing just the Nodes, which may be more convenient:
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = Flatten(['begin.o', foo, 'middle.o', bar, 'end.o'])
for object in objects:
    print(str(object))

   Note also that because builder calls return a list-like object, not an
   actual Python list, you should not use the Python add operator (+ or
   +=) to append builder results to a Python list. Because the list and
   the object are different types, Python will not update the original
   list in place, but will instead create a new Node-list object
   containing the concatenation of the list elements and the builder
   results. This will cause problems for any other Python variables in
   your SCons configuration that still hold on to a reference to the
   original list. Instead, use the Python list extend method to make sure
   the list is updated in-place. Example:
object_files = []

# Do NOT use += as follows:
#
#    object_files += Object('bar.c')
#
# It will not update the object_files list in place.
#
# Instead, use the list extend method:
object_files.extend(Object('bar.c'))


   The path name for a Node's file may be used by passing the Node to
   Python's builtin str function:
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
print("The path to bar_obj is:", str(bar_obj_list[0]))

   Note again that because the Builder call returns a list, we have to
   access the first element in the list ((bar_obj_list[0])) to get at the
   Node that actually represents the object file.

   Builder calls support a chdir keyword argument that specifies that the
   Builder's action(s) should be executed after changing directory. If the
   chdir argument is a string or a directory Node, scons will change to
   the specified directory. If the chdir is not a string or Node and is
   non-zero, then scons will change to the target file's directory.
# scons will change to the "sub" subdirectory
# before executing the "cp" command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in',
            "cp dir/foo.in dir/foo.out",
            chdir='sub')

# Because chdir is not a string, scons will change to the
# target's directory ("sub/dir") before executing the
# "cp" command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in',
            "cp foo.in foo.out",
            chdir=1)

   Note that scons will not automatically modify its expansion of
   construction variables like $TARGET and $SOURCE when using the chdir
   keyword argument--that is, the expanded file names will still be
   relative to the top-level SConstruct directory, and consequently
   incorrect relative to the chdir directory. If you use the chdir keyword
   argument, you will typically need to supply a different command line
   using expansions like ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to use just the
   filename portion of the targets and source.

   scons predefined the following builder methods. Depending on the setup
   of a particular construction environment and on the type and software
   installation status of the underlying system, not all builders may be
   available to that construction environment.

   CFile() , env.CFile()
          Builds a C source file given a lex (.l) or yacc (.y) input file.
          The suffix specified by the [936]$CFILESUFFIX construction
          variable (.c by default) is automatically added to the target if
          it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.c
env.CFile(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.l')
# builds bar.c
env.CFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.y')

   Command() , env.Command()
          The Command "Builder" is actually a function that looks like a
          Builder, but takes a required third argument, which is the
          action to take to construct the target from the source, used for
          "one-off" builds where a full builder is not needed. Thus it
          does not follow the builder calling rules described at the start
          of this section. See instead the [937]Command function
          description for the calling syntax and details.

   CXXFile() , env.CXXFile()
          Builds a C++ source file given a lex (.ll) or yacc (.yy) input
          file. The suffix specified by the [938]$CXXFILESUFFIX
          construction variable (.cc by default) is automatically added to
          the target if it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'foo.cc', source = 'foo.ll')
# builds bar.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.yy')

   DocbookEpub() , env.DocbookEpub()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for EPUB output.

          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual')

   DocbookHtmlChunked() , env.DocbookHtmlChunked()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for chunked HTML
          output. It supports the base.dir parameter. The chunkfast.xsl
          file (requires "EXSLT") is used as the default stylesheet. Basic
          syntax:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file.

          If you use the root.filename parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to specify the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir is provided. You can add the
          base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given prefix gets
          prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookHtmlhelp() , env.DocbookHtmlhelp()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTMLHELP
          output. Its basic syntax is:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file.

          If you use the root.filename parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to specify the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You
          can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given
          prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookMan() , env.DocbookMan()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for Man page
          output. Its basic syntax is:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookMan('manual')

          where manual.xml is the input file. Note, that you can specify a
          target name, but the actual output names are automatically set
          from the refname entries in your XML source.

   DocbookPdf() , env.DocbookPdf()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookPdf('manual')

   DocbookSlidesHtml() , env.DocbookSlidesHtml()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML slides
          output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual')

          If you use the titlefoil.html parameter in your own stylesheets
          you have to give the new target name. This ensures that the
          dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via "scons
          -c":

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('mymanual.html','manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl')

          Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You
          can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given
          prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl', base_dir='output/')

          Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base
          folder, else your files get renamed only!

   DocbookSlidesPdf() , env.DocbookSlidesPdf()
          A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF slides
          output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

          or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual')

   DocbookXInclude() , env.DocbookXInclude()
          A pseudo-Builder, for resolving XIncludes in a separate
          processing step.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookXInclude('manual_xincluded.xml', 'manual.xml')

   DocbookXslt() , env.DocbookXslt()
          A pseudo-Builder, applying a given XSL transformation to the
          input file.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookXslt('manual_transformed.xml', 'manual.xml', xsl='transform.xslt')

          Note, that this builder requires the xsl parameter to be set.

   DVI() , env.DVI()
          Builds a .dvi file from a .tex, .ltx or .latex input file. If
          the source file suffix is .tex, scons will examine the contents
          of the file; if the string \documentclass or \documentstyle is
          found, the file is assumed to be a LaTeX file and the target is
          built by invoking the [939]$LATEXCOM command line; otherwise,
          the [940]$TEXCOM command line is used. If the file is a LaTeX
          file, the DVI builder method will also examine the contents of
          the .aux file and invoke the [941]$BIBTEX command line if the
          string bibdata is found, start [942]$MAKEINDEX to generate an
          index if a .ind file is found and will examine the contents .log
          file and re-run the [943]$LATEXCOM command if the log file says
          it is necessary.

          The suffix .dvi (hard-coded within TeX itself) is automatically
          added to the target if it is not already present. Examples:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.DVI(target = 'aaa.dvi', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.dvi
env.DVI(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.ltx')
# builds from ccc.latex
env.DVI(target = 'ccc.dvi', source = 'ccc.latex')

   Gs() , env.Gs()
          A Builder for explicitly calling the gs executable. Depending on
          the underlying OS, the different names gs, gsos2 and gswin32c
          are tried.

env = Environment(tools=['gs'])
env.Gs('cover.jpg','scons-scons.pdf',
       GSFLAGS='-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=jpeg -dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=1 -q')
       )

   Install() , env.Install()
          Installs one or more source files or directories in the
          specified target, which must be a directory. The names of the
          specified source files or directories remain the same within the
          destination directory. The sources may be given as a string or
          as a node returned by a builder.

env.Install('/usr/local/bin', source = ['foo', 'bar'])

          If the --install-sandbox command line option is given, the
          target directory will be prefixed by the directory path
          specified. This is useful to test installs without installing to
          a "live" location in the system.

          See also FindInstalledFiles. For more thoughts on installation,
          see the User Guide (particularly the section on Command-Line
          Targets and the chapters on Installing Files and on Alias
          Targets).

   InstallAs() , env.InstallAs()
          Installs one or more source files or directories to specific
          names, allowing changing a file or directory name as part of the
          installation. It is an error if the target and source arguments
          list different numbers of files or directories.

env.InstallAs(target = '/usr/local/bin/foo',
              source = 'foo_debug')
env.InstallAs(target = ['../lib/libfoo.a', '../lib/libbar.a'],
              source = ['libFOO.a', 'libBAR.a'])

   InstallVersionedLib() , env.InstallVersionedLib()
          Installs a versioned shared library. The symlinks appropriate to
          the architecture will be generated based on symlinks of the
          source library.

env.InstallVersionedLib(target = '/usr/local/bin/foo',
              source = 'libxyz.1.5.2.so')

   Jar() , env.Jar()
          Builds a Java archive (.jar) file from the specified list of
          sources. Any directories in the source list will be searched for
          .class files). Any .java files in the source list will be
          compiled to .class files by calling the [944]Java Builder.

          If the [945]$JARCHDIR value is set, the jar command will change
          to the specified directory using the -C option. If $JARCHDIR is
          not set explicitly, SCons will use the top of any subdirectory
          tree in which Java .class were built by the [946]Java Builder.

          If the contents any of the source files begin with the string
          Manifest-Version, the file is assumed to be a manifest and is
          passed to the jar command with the m option set.

env.Jar(target = 'foo.jar', source = 'classes')

env.Jar(target = 'bar.jar',
        source = ['bar1.java', 'bar2.java'])

   Java() , env.Java()
          Builds one or more Java class files. The sources may be any
          combination of explicit .java files, or directory trees which
          will be scanned for .java files.

          SCons will parse each source .java file to find the classes
          (including inner classes) defined within that file, and from
          that figure out the target .class files that will be created.
          The class files will be placed underneath the specified target
          directory.

          SCons will also search each Java file for the Java package name,
          which it assumes can be found on a line beginning with the
          string package in the first column; the resulting .class files
          will be placed in a directory reflecting the specified package
          name. For example, the file Foo.java defining a single public
          Foo class and containing a package name of sub.dir will generate
          a corresponding sub/dir/Foo.class class file.

          Examples:

                env.Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
                env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['src1', 'src2'])
                env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['File1.java', 'File2.java
'])

          Java source files can use the native encoding for the underlying
          OS. Since SCons compiles in simple ASCII mode by default, the
          compiler will generate warnings about unmappable characters,
          which may lead to errors as the file is processed further. In
          this case, the user must specify the LANG environment variable
          to tell the compiler what encoding is used. For portibility,
          it's best if the encoding is hard-coded so that the compile will
          work if it is done on a system with a different encoding.

                env = Environment()
                env['ENV']['LANG'] = 'en_GB.UTF-8'

   JavaH() , env.JavaH()
          Builds C header and source files for implementing Java native
          methods. The target can be either a directory in which the
          header files will be written, or a header file name which will
          contain all of the definitions. The source can be the names of
          .class files, the names of .java files to be compiled into
          .class files by calling the [947]Java builder method, or the
          objects returned from the Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [948]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the JavaH builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

          Examples:

# builds java_native.h
classes = env.Java(target = 'classdir', source = 'src')
env.JavaH(target = 'java_native.h', source = classes)

# builds include/package_foo.h and include/package_bar.h
env.JavaH(target = 'include',
          source = ['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'])

# builds export/foo.h and export/bar.h
env.JavaH(target = 'export',
          source = ['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
          JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes')

   Library() , env.Library()
          A synonym for the StaticLibrary builder method.

   LoadableModule() , env.LoadableModule()
          On most systems, this is the same as SharedLibrary. On Mac OS X
          (Darwin) platforms, this creates a loadable module bundle.

   M4() , env.M4()
          Builds an output file from an M4 input file. This uses a default
          [949]$M4FLAGS value of -E, which considers all warnings to be
          fatal and stops on the first warning when using the GNU version
          of m4. Example:

env.M4(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.c.m4')

   Moc() , env.Moc()
          Builds an output file from a moc input file. Moc input files are
          either header files or cxx files. This builder is only available
          after using the tool 'qt'. See the [950]$QTDIR variable for more
          information. Example:

env.Moc('foo.h') # generates moc_foo.cc
env.Moc('foo.cpp') # generates foo.moc

   MOFiles() , env.MOFiles()
          This builder belongs to [951]msgfmt tool. The builder compiles
          PO files to MO files.

          Example 1. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po:

  # ...
  env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'])

          Example 2. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

  # ...
  env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 3. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po
          plus files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

  # ...
  env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 4. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file
          (another version):

  # ...
  env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
  env.MOFiles()

   MSVSProject() , env.MSVSProject()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio project file, and by default
          builds a solution file as well.

          This builds a Visual Studio project file, based on the version
          of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [952]$MSVS_VERSION in the
          Environment constructor). For Visual Studio 6, it will generate
          a .dsp file. For Visual Studio 7, 8, and 9, it will generate a
          .vcproj file. For Visual Studio 10 and later, it will generate a
          .vcxproj file.

          By default, this also generates a solution file for the
          specified project, a .dsw file for Visual Studio 6 or a .sln
          file for Visual Studio 7 and later. This behavior may be
          disabled by specifying auto_build_solution=0 when you call
          MSVSProject, in which case you presumably want to build the
          solution file(s) by calling the MSVSSolution Builder (see
          below).

          The MSVSProject builder takes several lists of filenames to be
          placed into the project file. These are currently limited to
          srcs, incs, localincs, resources, and misc. These are pretty
          self-explanatory, but it should be noted that these lists are
          added to the [953]$SOURCES construction variable as strings, NOT
          as SCons File Nodes. This is because they represent file names
          to be added to the project file, not the source files used to
          build the project file.

          The above filename lists are all optional, although at least one
          must be specified for the resulting project file to be
          non-empty.

          In addition to the above lists of values, the following values
          may be specified:

        target
                The name of the target .dsp or .vcproj file. The correct
                suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but
                the [954]$MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX construction variable will be
                defined to the correct value (see example below).

        variant
                The name of this particular variant. For Visual Studio 7
                projects, this can also be a list of variant names. These
                are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really
                can be anything you want. For Visual Studio 7 projects,
                they may also specify a target platform separated from the
                variant name by a | (vertical pipe) character: Debug|Xbox.
                The default target platform is Win32. Multiple calls to
                MSVSProject with different variants are allowed; all
                variants will be added to the project file with their
                appropriate build targets and sources.

        cmdargs
                Additional command line arguments for the different
                variants. The number of cmdargs entries must match the
                number of variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If
                you give only one, it will automatically be propagated to
                all variants.

        cppdefines
                Preprocessor definitions for the different variants. The
                number of cppdefines entries must match the number of
                variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give
                only one, it will automatically be propagated to all
                variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use
                the invoking environment's CPPDEFINES entry for all
                variants.

        cpppaths
                Compiler include paths for the different variants. The
                number of cpppaths entries must match the number of
                variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give
                only one, it will automatically be propagated to all
                variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use
                the invoking environment's CPPPATH entry for all variants.

        buildtarget
                An optional string, node, or list of strings or nodes (one
                per build variant), to tell the Visual Studio debugger
                what output target to use in what build variant. The
                number of buildtarget entries must match the number of
                variant entries.

        runfile
                The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later will
                run and debug. This appears as the value of the Output
                field in the resulting Visual Studio project file. If this
                is not specified, the default is the same as the specified
                buildtarget value.

          Note that because SCons always executes its build commands from
          the directory in which the SConstruct file is located, if you
          generate a project file in a different directory than the
          SConstruct directory, users will not be able to double-click on
          the file name in compilation error messages displayed in the
          Visual Studio console output window. This can be remedied by
          adding the Visual C/C++ /FC compiler option to the [955]$CCFLAGS
          variable so that the compiler will print the full path name of
          any files that cause compilation errors.

          Example usage:

barsrcs = ['bar.cpp']
barincs = ['bar.h']
barlocalincs = ['StdAfx.h']
barresources = ['bar.rc','resource.h']
barmisc = ['bar_readme.txt']

dll = env.SharedLibrary(target='bar.dll',
                        source=barsrcs)
buildtarget = [s for s in dll if str(s).endswith('dll')]
env.MSVSProject(target='Bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX'],
                srcs=barsrcs,
                incs=barincs,
                localincs=barlocalincs,
                resources=barresources,
                misc=barmisc,
                buildtarget=buildtarget,
                variant='Release')

          Starting with version 2.4 of SCons it is also possible to
          specify the optional argument DebugSettings, which creates files
          for debugging under Visual Studio:

        DebugSettings
                A dictionary of debug settings that get written to the
                .vcproj.user or the .vcxproj.user file, depending on the
                version installed. As it is done for cmdargs (see above),
                you can specify a DebugSettings dictionary per variant. If
                you give only one, it will be propagated to all variants.

          Currently, only Visual Studio v9.0 and Visual Studio version v11
          are implemented, for other versions no file is generated. To
          generate the user file, you just need to add a DebugSettings
          dictionary to the environment with the right parameters for your
          MSVS version. If the dictionary is empty, or does not contain
          any good value, no file will be generated.

          Following is a more contrived example, involving the setup of a
          project for variants and DebugSettings:

# Assuming you store your defaults in a file
vars = Variables('variables.py')
msvcver = vars.args.get('vc', '9')

# Check command args to force one Microsoft Visual Studio version
if msvcver == '9' or msvcver == '11':
  env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION=msvcver+'.0', MSVC_BATCH=False)
else:
  env = Environment()

   MSVSSolution() , env.MSVSSolution()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio solution file.

          This builds a Visual Studio solution file, based on the version
          of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed
          version, or the version specified by [956]$MSVS_VERSION in the
          construction environment). For Visual Studio 6, it will generate
          a .dsw file. For Visual Studio 7 (.NET), it will generate a .sln
          file.

          The following values must be specified:

        target
                The name of the target .dsw or .sln file. The correct
                suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but
                the value [957]$MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX will be defined to the
                correct value (see example below).

        variant
                The name of this particular variant, or a list of variant
                names (the latter is only supported for MSVS 7 solutions).
                These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but
                really can be anything you want. For MSVS 7 they may also
                specify target platform, like this "Debug|Xbox". Default
                platform is Win32.

        projects
                A list of project file names, or Project nodes returned by
                calls to the MSVSProject Builder, to be placed into the
                solution file. It should be noted that these file names
                are NOT added to the $SOURCES environment variable in form
                of files, but rather as strings. This is because they
                represent file names to be added to the solution file, not
                the source files used to build the solution file.

          Example Usage:

env.MSVSSolution(target='Bar' + env['MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX'], projects=['bar' + env
['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX']], variant='Release')

   Object() , env.Object()
          A synonym for the StaticObject builder method.

   Package() , env.Package()
          Builds a Binary Package of the given source files.

env.Package(source = FindInstalledFiles())

          Builds software distribution packages. Packages consist of files
          to install and packaging information. The former may be
          specified with the source parameter and may be left out, in
          which case the FindInstalledFiles function will collect all
          files that have an Install or InstallAs Builder attached. If the
          target is not specified it will be deduced from additional
          information given to this Builder.

          The packaging information is specified with the help of
          construction variables documented below. This information is
          called a tag to stress that some of them can also be attached to
          files with the Tag function. The mandatory ones will complain if
          they were not specified. They vary depending on chosen target
          packager.

          The target packager may be selected with the "PACKAGETYPE"
          command line option or with the $PACKAGETYPE construction
          variable. Currently the following packagers available:

          * msi - Microsoft Installer * rpm - RPM Package Manger * ipkg -
          Itsy Package Management System * tarbz2 - bzip2 compressed tar *
          targz - gzip compressed tar * tarxz - xz compressed tar * zip -
          zip file * src_tarbz2 - bzip2 compressed tar source * src_targz
          - gzip compressed tar source * src_tarxz - xz compressed tar
          source * src_zip - zip file source

          An updated list is always available under the "package_type"
          option when running "scons --help" on a project that has
          packaging activated.

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'packaging'])
env.Install('/bin/', 'my_program')
env.Package( NAME           = 'foo',
             VERSION        = '1.2.3',
             PACKAGEVERSION = 0,
             PACKAGETYPE    = 'rpm',
             LICENSE        = 'gpl',
             SUMMARY        = 'balalalalal',
             DESCRIPTION    = 'this should be really really long',
             X_RPM_GROUP    = 'Application/fu',
             SOURCE_URL     = 'http://foo.org/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz'
        )

   PCH() , env.PCH()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header. Calling this
          builder method returns a list of two targets: the PCH as the
          first element, and the object file as the second element.
          Normally the object file is ignored. This builder method is only
          provided when Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the
          compiler. The PCH builder method is generally used in
          conjunction with the PCH construction variable to force object
          files to use the precompiled header:

env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]

   PDF() , env.PDF()
          Builds a .pdf file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [958]$PDFSUFFIX construction variable (.pdf by default) is added
          automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PDF(target = 'aaa.pdf', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.pdf from bbb.dvi
env.PDF(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   POInit() , env.POInit()
          This builder belongs to [959]msginit tool. The builder
          initializes missing PO file(s) if [960]$POAUTOINIT is set. If
          [961]$POAUTOINIT is not set (default), POInit prints instruction
          for user (that is supposed to be a translator), telling how the
          PO file should be initialized. In normal projects you should not
          use POInit and use [962]POUpdate instead. [963]POUpdate chooses
          intelligently between msgmerge(1) and msginit(1). POInit always
          uses msginit(1) and should be regarded as builder for special
          purposes or for temporary use (e.g. for quick, one time
          initialization of a bunch of PO files) or for tests.

          Target nodes defined through POInit are not built by default
          (they're Ignored from '.' node) but are added to special Alias
          ('po-create' by default). The alias name may be changed through
          the [964]$POCREATE_ALIAS construction variable. All PO files
          defined through POInit may be easily initialized by scons
          po-create.

          Example 1. Initialize en.po and pl.po from messages.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl']) # messages.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 2. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], ['foo']) # foo.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 3. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot but using
          [965]$POTDOMAIN construction variable:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo') # foo.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 4. Initialize PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS
          file. The files will be initialized from template messages.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(LINGUAS_FILE = 1) # needs 'LINGUAS' file

          Example 5. Initialize en.po and pl.pl PO files plus files for
          languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files will be initialized
          from template messages.pot:

  # ...
  env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 6. You may preconfigure your environment first, and then
          initialize PO files:

  # ...
  env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
  env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
  env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
  env.POInit()

          which has same efect as:

  # ...
  env.POInit(POAUTOINIT = 1, LINGUAS_FILE = 1, POTDOMAIN = 'foo')

   PostScript() , env.PostScript()
          Builds a .ps file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a
          .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the
          [966]$PSSUFFIX construction variable (.ps by default) is added
          automatically to the target if it is not already present.
          Example:

# builds from aaa.tex
env.PostScript(target = 'aaa.ps', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.ps from bbb.dvi
env.PostScript(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

   POTUpdate() , env.POTUpdate()
          The builder belongs to [967]xgettext tool. The builder updates
          target POT file if exists or creates one if it doesn't. The node
          is not built by default (i.e. it is Ignored from '.'), but only
          on demand (i.e. when given POT file is required or when special
          alias is invoked). This builder adds its targe node
          (messages.pot, say) to a special alias (pot-update by default,
          see [968]$POTUPDATE_ALIAS) so you can update/create them easily
          with scons pot-update. The file is not written until there is no
          real change in internationalized messages (or in comments that
          enter POT file).

Note

          You may see xgettext(1) being invoked by the [969]xgettext tool
          even if there is no real change in internationalized messages
          (so the POT file is not being updated). This happens every time
          a source file has changed. In such case we invoke xgettext(1)
          and compare its output with the content of POT file to decide
          whether the file should be updated or not.

          Example 1. Let's create po/ directory and place following
          SConstruct script there:

  # SConstruct in 'po/' subdir
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(['foo'], ['../a.cpp', '../b.cpp'])
  env.POTUpdate(['bar'], ['../c.cpp', '../d.cpp'])

          Then invoke scons few times:

  user@host:$ scons             # Does not create foo.pot nor bar.pot
  user@host:$ scons foo.pot     # Updates or creates foo.pot
  user@host:$ scons pot-update  # Updates or creates foo.pot and bar.pot
  user@host:$ scons -c          # Does not clean foo.pot nor bar.pot.

          the results shall be as the comments above say.

          Example 2. The POTUpdate builder may be used with no target
          specified, in which case default target messages.pot will be
          used. The default target may also be overridden by setting
          [970]$POTDOMAIN construction variable or providing it as an
          override to POTUpdate builder:


  # SConstruct script
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env['POTDOMAIN'] = "foo"
  env.POTUpdate(source = ["a.cpp", "b.cpp"]) # Creates foo.pot ...
  env.POTUpdate(POTDOMAIN = "bar", source = ["c.cpp", "d.cpp"]) # and bar.pot

          Example 3. The sources may be specified within separate file,
          for example POTFILES.in:


  # POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory
  ../a.cpp
  ../b.cpp
  # end of file

          The name of the file (POTFILES.in) containing the list of
          sources is provided via [971]$XGETTEXTFROM:


  # SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in')

          Example 4. You may use [972]$XGETTEXTPATH to define source
          search path. Assume, for example, that you have files a.cpp,
          b.cpp, po/SConstruct, po/POTFILES.in. Then your POT-related
          files could look as below:

  # POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory
  a.cpp
  b.cpp
  # end of file

  # SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH='../')

          Example 5. Multiple search directories may be defined within a
          list, i.e. XGETTEXTPATH = ['dir1', 'dir2', ...]. The order in
          the list determines the search order of source files. The path
          to the first file found is used.

          Let's create 0/1/po/SConstruct script:

  # SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../', '../../'])

          and 0/1/po/POTFILES.in:

  # POTFILES.in in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
  a.cpp
  # end of file

          Write two *.cpp files, the first one is 0/a.cpp:

  /* 0/a.cpp */
  gettext("Hello from ../../a.cpp")

          and the second is 0/1/a.cpp:

  /* 0/1/a.cpp */
  gettext("Hello from ../a.cpp")

          then run scons. You'll obtain 0/1/po/messages.pot with the
          message "Hello from ../a.cpp". When you reverse order in
          $XGETTEXTFOM, i.e. when you write SConscript as

  # SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
  env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
  env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../../', '../'])

          then the messages.pot will contain msgid "Hello from
          ../../a.cpp" line and not msgid "Hello from ../a.cpp".

   POUpdate() , env.POUpdate()
          The builder belongs to [973]msgmerge tool. The builder updates
          PO files with msgmerge(1), or initializes missing PO files as
          described in documentation of [974]msginit tool and [975]POInit
          builder (see also [976]$POAUTOINIT). Note, that POUpdate does
          not add its targets to po-create alias as [977]POInit does.

          Target nodes defined through POUpdate are not built by default
          (they're Ignored from '.' node). Instead, they are added
          automatically to special Alias ('po-update' by default). The
          alias name may be changed through the [978]$POUPDATE_ALIAS
          construction variable. You can easily update PO files in your
          project by scons po-update.

          Example 1. Update en.po and pl.po from messages.pot template
          (see also [979]$POTDOMAIN), assuming that the later one exists
          or there is rule to build it (see [980]POTUpdate):

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(['en','pl']) # messages.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

          Example 2. Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot template:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], ['foo']) # foo.pot -->  [en.po, pl.pl]

          Example 3. Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot (another
          version):

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo') # foo.pot -- > [en.po, pl.pl]

          Example 4. Update files for languages defined in LINGUAS file.
          The files are updated from messages.pot template:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1) # needs 'LINGUAS' file

          Example 5. Same as above, but update from foo.pot template:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, source = ['foo'])

          Example 6. Update en.po and pl.po plus files for languages
          defined in LINGUAS file. The files are updated from messages.pot
          template:

  # produce 'en.po', 'pl.po' + files defined in 'LINGUAS':
  env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl' ], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Example 7. Use [981]$POAUTOINIT to automatically initialize PO
          file if it doesn't exist:

  # ...
  env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, POAUTOINIT = 1)

          Example 8. Update PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS
          file. The files are updated from foo.pot template. All necessary
          settings are pre-configured via environment.

  # ...
  env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
  env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
  env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
  env.POUpdate()

   Program() , env.Program()
          Builds an executable given one or more object files or C, C++,
          D, or Fortran source files. If any C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files are specified, then they will be automatically compiled to
          object files using the Object builder method; see that builder
          method's description for a list of legal source file suffixes
          and how they are interpreted. The target executable file prefix
          (specified by the [982]$PROGPREFIX construction variable;
          nothing by default) and suffix (specified by the
          [983]$PROGSUFFIX construction variable; by default, .exe on
          Windows systems, nothing on POSIX systems) are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.Program(target = 'foo', source = ['foo.o', 'bar.c', 'baz.f'])

   ProgramAllAtOnce() , env.ProgramAllAtOnce()
          Builds an executable from D sources without first creating
          individual objects for each file.

          D sources can be compiled file-by-file as C and C++ source are,
          and D is integrated into the scons Object and Program builders
          for this model of build. D codes can though do whole source
          meta-programming (some of the testing frameworks do this). For
          this it is imperative that all sources are compiled and linked
          in a single call to the D compiler. This builder serves that
          purpose.

    env.ProgramAllAtOnce('executable', ['mod_a.d, mod_b.d', 'mod_c.d'])

          This command will compile the modules mod_a, mod_b, and mod_c in
          a single compilation process without first creating object files
          for the modules. Some of the D compilers will create
          executable.o others will not.

   RES() , env.RES()
          Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ resource file. This builder method
          is only provided when Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW is being
          used as the compiler. The .res (or .o for MinGW) suffix is added
          to the target name if no other suffix is given. The source file
          is scanned for implicit dependencies as though it were a C file.
          Example:

env.RES('resource.rc')

   RMIC() , env.RMIC()
          Builds stub and skeleton class files for remote objects from
          Java .class files. The target is a directory relative to which
          the stub and skeleton class files will be written. The source
          can be the names of .class files, or the objects return from the
          Java builder method.

          If the construction variable [984]$JAVACLASSDIR is set, either
          in the environment or in the call to the RMIC builder method
          itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the
          beginning of any .class file names.

classes = env.Java(target = 'classdir', source = 'src')
env.RMIC(target = 'outdir1', source = classes)

env.RMIC(target = 'outdir2',
         source = ['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'])

env.RMIC(target = 'outdir3',
         source = ['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
         JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes')

   RPCGenClient() , env.RPCGenClient()
          Generates an RPC client stub (_clnt.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_clnt.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenHeader() , env.RPCGenHeader()
          Generates an RPC header (.h) file from a specified RPC (.x)
          source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif.h
env.RPCGenHeader('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenService() , env.RPCGenService()
          Generates an RPC server-skeleton (_svc.c) file from a specified
          RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in
          the local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_svc.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   RPCGenXDR() , env.RPCGenXDR()
          Generates an RPC XDR routine (_xdr.c) file from a specified RPC
          (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the
          local directory, the command will be executed in the source
          file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_xdr.c
env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

   SharedLibrary() , env.SharedLibrary()
          Builds a shared library (.so on a POSIX system, .dll on Windows)
          given one or more object files or C, C++, D or Fortran source
          files. If any source files are given, then they will be
          automatically compiled to object files. The static library
          prefix and suffix (if any) are automatically added to the
          target. The target library file prefix (specified by the
          [985]$SHLIBPREFIX construction variable; by default, lib on
          POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems) and suffix (specified
          by the [986]$SHLIBSUFFIX construction variable; by default, .dll
          on Windows systems, .so on POSIX systems) are automatically
          added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          On Windows systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always
          build an import (.lib) library in addition to the shared (.dll)
          library, adding a .lib library with the same basename if there
          is not already a .lib file explicitly listed in the targets.

          On Cygwin systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always
          build an import (.dll.a) library in addition to the shared
          (.dll) library, adding a .dll.a library with the same basename
          if there is not already a .dll.a file explicitly listed in the
          targets.

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          shared library (that is, using the SharedObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

          On some platforms, there is a distinction between a shared
          library (loaded automatically by the system to resolve external
          references) and a loadable module (explicitly loaded by user
          action). For maximum portability, use the LoadableModule builder
          for the latter.

          When the [987]$SHLIBVERSION construction variable is defined a
          versioned shared library is created. This modifies the
          [988]$SHLINKFLAGS as required, adds the version number to the
          library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed.

env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'], SHLIBVERSION='1.5
.2')

          On a POSIX system, versions with a single token create exactly
          one symlink: libbar.so.6 would have symlinks libbar.so only. On
          a POSIX system, versions with two or more tokens create exactly
          two symlinks: libbar.so.2.3.1 would have symlinks libbar.so and
          libbar.so.2; on a Darwin (OSX) system the library would be
          libbar.2.3.1.dylib and the link would be libbar.dylib.

          On Windows systems, specifying register=1 will cause the .dll to
          be registered after it is built using REGSVR32. The command that
          is run ("regsvr32" by default) is determined by [989]$REGSVR
          construction variable, and the flags passed are determined by
          [990]$REGSVRFLAGS. By default, [991]$REGSVRFLAGS includes the /s
          option, to prevent dialogs from popping up and requiring user
          attention when it is run. If you change [992]$REGSVRFLAGS, be
          sure to include the /s option. For example,

env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar',
                  source = ['bar.cxx', 'foo.obj'],
                  register=1)

          will register bar.dll as a COM object when it is done linking
          it.

   SharedObject() , env.SharedObject()
          Builds an object file for inclusion in a shared library. Source
          files must have one of the same set of extensions specified
          above for the StaticObject builder method. On some platforms
          building a shared object requires additional compiler option
          (e.g. -fPIC for gcc) in addition to those needed to build a
          normal (static) object, but on some platforms there is no
          difference between a shared object and a normal (static) one.
          When there is a difference, SCons will only allow shared objects
          to be linked into a shared library, and will use a different
          suffix for shared objects. On platforms where there is no
          difference, SCons will allow both normal (static) and shared
          objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use the
          same suffix for shared and normal (static) objects. The target
          object file prefix (specified by the [993]$SHOBJPREFIX
          construction variable; by default, the same as [994]$OBJPREFIX)
          and suffix (specified by the [995]$SHOBJSUFFIX construction
          variable) are automatically added to the target if not already
          present. Examples:

env.SharedObject(target = 'ddd', source = 'ddd.c')
env.SharedObject(target = 'eee.o', source = 'eee.cpp')
env.SharedObject(target = 'fff.obj', source = 'fff.for')

          Note that the source files will be scanned according to the
          suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner object. See the section
          "Scanner Objects," below, for more information.

   StaticLibrary() , env.StaticLibrary()
          Builds a static library given one or more object files or C,
          C++, D or Fortran source files. If any source files are given,
          then they will be automatically compiled to object files. The
          static library prefix and suffix (if any) are automatically
          added to the target. The target library file prefix (specified
          by the [996]$LIBPREFIX construction variable; by default, lib on
          POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems) and suffix (specified
          by the [997]$LIBSUFFIX construction variable; by default, .lib
          on Windows systems, .a on POSIX systems) are automatically added
          to the target if not already present. Example:

env.StaticLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

          Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a
          static library (that is, using the StaticObject builder method).
          scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

   StaticObject() , env.StaticObject()
          Builds a static object file from one or more C, C++, D, or
          Fortran source files. Source files must have one of the
          following extensions:

  .asm    assembly language file
  .ASM    assembly language file
  .c      C file
  .C      Windows:  C file
          POSIX:  C++ file
  .cc     C++ file
  .cpp    C++ file
  .cxx    C++ file
  .cxx    C++ file
  .c++    C++ file
  .C++    C++ file
  .d      D file
  .f      Fortran file
  .F      Windows:  Fortran file
          POSIX:  Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .for    Fortran file
  .FOR    Fortran file
  .fpp    Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .FPP    Fortran file + C pre-processor
  .m      Object C file
  .mm     Object C++ file
  .s      assembly language file
  .S      Windows:  assembly language file
          ARM: CodeSourcery Sourcery Lite
  .sx     assembly language file + C pre-processor
          POSIX:  assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .spp    assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .SPP    assembly language file + C pre-processor

          The target object file prefix (specified by the [998]$OBJPREFIX
          construction variable; nothing by default) and suffix (specified
          by the [999]$OBJSUFFIX construction variable; .obj on Windows
          systems, .o on POSIX systems) are automatically added to the
          target if not already present. Examples:

env.StaticObject(target = 'aaa', source = 'aaa.c')
env.StaticObject(target = 'bbb.o', source = 'bbb.c++')
env.StaticObject(target = 'ccc.obj', source = 'ccc.f')

          Note that the source files will be scanned according to the
          suffix mappings in SourceFileScanner object. See the section
          "Scanner Objects," below, for more information.

   Substfile() , env.Substfile()
          The Substfile builder creates a single text file from another
          file or set of files by concatenating them with $LINESEPARATOR
          and replacing text using the $SUBST_DICT construction variable.
          Nested lists of source files are flattened. See also Textfile.

          If a single source file is present with an .in suffix, the
          suffix is stripped and the remainder is used as the default
          target name.

          The prefix and suffix specified by the $SUBSTFILEPREFIX and
          $SUBSTFILESUFFIX construction variables (the null string by
          default in both cases) are automatically added to the target if
          they are not already present.

          If a construction variable named $SUBST_DICT is present, it may
          be either a Python dictionary or a sequence of (key,value)
          tuples. If it is a dictionary it is converted into a list of
          tuples in an arbitrary order, so if one key is a prefix of
          another key or if one substitution could be further expanded by
          another subsitition, it is unpredictable whether the expansion
          will occur.

          Any occurrences of a key in the source are replaced by the
          corresponding value, which may be a Python callable function or
          a string. If the value is a callable, it is called with no
          arguments to get a string. Strings are subst-expanded and the
          result replaces the key.

env = Environment(tools=['default'])

env['prefix'] = '/usr/bin'
script_dict = {'@prefix@': '/bin', '@exec_prefix@': '$prefix'}
env.Substfile('script.in', SUBST_DICT = script_dict)

conf_dict = {'%VERSION%': '1.2.3', '%BASE%': 'MyProg'}
env.Substfile('config.h.in', conf_dict, SUBST_DICT = conf_dict)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one key is a prefix of another
bad_foo = {'$foo': '$foo', '$foobar': '$foobar'}
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT = bad_foo)

# PREDICTABLE - keys are applied longest first
good_foo = [('$foobar', '$foobar'), ('$foo', '$foo')]
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT = good_foo)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one substitution could be futher expanded
bad_bar = {'@bar@': '@soap@', '@soap@': 'lye'}
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT = bad_bar)

# PREDICTABLE - substitutions are expanded in order
good_bar = (('@bar@', '@soap@'), ('@soap@', 'lye'))
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT = good_bar)

# the SUBST_DICT may be in common (and not an override)
substutions = {}
subst = Environment(tools=['textfile'], SUBST_DICT=substitutions)
substitutions['@foo@'] = 'foo'
subst['SUBST_DICT']['@bar@'] = 'bar'
subst.Substfile('pgm1.c', [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'),
                           Value('#include "@bar@.h"'),
                           "common.in",
                           "pgm1.in"
                          ])
subst.Substfile('pgm2.c', [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'),
                           Value('#include "@bar@.h"'),
                           "common.in",
                           "pgm2.in"
                          ])


   Tar() , env.Tar()
          Builds a tar archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Tar builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Tar('src.tar', 'src')

# Create the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', 'another')

# Set TARFLAGS to create a gzip-filtered archive.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z')
env.Tar('foo.tar.gz', 'foo')

# Also set the suffix to .tgz.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z',
                  TARSUFFIX = '.tgz')
env.Tar('foo')

   Textfile() , env.Textfile()
          The Textfile builder generates a single text file. The source
          strings constitute the lines; nested lists of sources are
          flattened. $LINESEPARATOR is used to separate the strings.

          If present, the $SUBST_DICT construction variable is used to
          modify the strings before they are written; see the Substfile
          description for details.

          The prefix and suffix specified by the $TEXTFILEPREFIX and
          $TEXTFILESUFFIX construction variables (the null string and .txt
          by default, respectively) are automatically added to the target
          if they are not already present. Examples:

# builds/writes foo.txt
env.Textfile(target = 'foo.txt', source = ['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'])

# builds/writes bar.txt
env.Textfile(target = 'bar',
             source = ['lalala', 'tanteratei'],
             LINESEPARATOR='|*')

# nested lists are flattened automatically
env.Textfile(target = 'blob',
             source = ['lalala', ['Goethe', 42 'Schiller'], 'tanteratei'])

# files may be used as input by wraping them in File()
env.Textfile(target = 'concat',  # concatenate files with a marker between
             source = [File('concat1'), File('concat2')],
             LINESEPARATOR = '====================\n')

Results are:
foo.txt
  ....8<----
  Goethe
  42
  Schiller
  ....8<---- (no linefeed at the end)

bar.txt:
  ....8<----
  lalala|*tanteratei
  ....8<---- (no linefeed at the end)

blob.txt
  ....8<----
  lalala
  Goethe
  42
  Schiller
  tanteratei
  ....8<---- (no linefeed at the end)

   Translate() , env.Translate()
          This pseudo-builder belongs to [1000]gettext toolset. The
          builder extracts internationalized messages from source files,
          updates POT template (if necessary) and then updates PO
          translations (if necessary). If [1001]$POAUTOINIT is set,
          missing PO files will be automatically created (i.e. without
          translator person intervention). The variables
          [1002]$LINGUAS_FILE and [1003]$POTDOMAIN are taken into acount
          too. All other construction variables used by [1004]POTUpdate,
          and [1005]POUpdate work here too.

          Example 1. The simplest way is to specify input files and output
          languages inline in a SCons script when invoking Translate

# SConscript in 'po/' directory
env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
env.Translate(['en','pl'], ['../a.cpp','../b.cpp'])

          Example 2. If you wish, you may also stick to conventional style
          known from autotools, i.e. using POTFILES.in and LINGUAS files

# LINGUAS
en pl
#end

# POTFILES.in
a.cpp
b.cpp
# end

# SConscript
env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
env['XGETTEXTPATH'] = ['../']
env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in')

          The last approach is perhaps the recommended one. It allows
          easily split internationalization/localization onto separate
          SCons scripts, where a script in source tree is responsible for
          translations (from sources to PO files) and script(s) under
          variant directories are responsible for compilation of PO to MO
          files to and for installation of MO files. The "gluing factor"
          synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of LINGUAS
          file. Note, that the updated POT and PO files are usually going
          to be committed back to the repository, so they must be updated
          within the source directory (and not in variant directories).
          Additionaly, the file listing of po/ directory contains LINGUAS
          file, so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they
          may work with the project in their usual way.

          Example 3. Let's prepare a development tree as below

 project/
  + SConstruct
  + build/
  + src/
      + po/
          + SConscript
          + SConscript.i18n
          + POTFILES.in
          + LINGUAS

          with build being variant directory. Write the top-level
          SConstruct script as follows

  # SConstruct
  env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
  VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate = 0)
  env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
  SConscript('src/po/SConscript.i18n', exports = 'env')
  SConscript('build/po/SConscript', exports = 'env')

          the src/po/SConscript.i18n as

  # src/po/SConscript.i18n
  Import('env')
  env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE=1, XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../']
)

          and the src/po/SConscript

  # src/po/SConscript
  Import('env')
  env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

          Such setup produces POT and PO files under source tree in
          src/po/ and binary MO files under variant tree in build/po/.
          This way the POT and PO files are separated from other output
          files, which must not be committed back to source repositories
          (e.g. MO files).

Note

          In above example, the PO files are not updated, nor created
          automatically when you issue scons '.' command. The files must
          be updated (created) by hand via scons po-update and then MO
          files can be compiled by running scons '.'.

   TypeLibrary() , env.TypeLibrary()
          Builds a Windows type library (.tlb) file from an input IDL file
          (.idl). In addition, it will build the associated interface stub
          and proxy source files, naming them according to the base name
          of the .idl file. For example,

env.TypeLibrary(source="foo.idl")

          Will create foo.tlb, foo.h, foo_i.c, foo_p.c and foo_data.c
          files.

   Uic() , env.Uic()
          Builds a header file, an implementation file and a moc file from
          an ui file. and returns the corresponding nodes in the above
          order. This builder is only available after using the tool 'qt'.
          Note: you can specify .ui files directly as source files to the
          Program, Library and SharedLibrary builders without using this
          builder. Using this builder lets you override the standard
          naming conventions (be careful: prefixes are always prepended to
          names of built files; if you don't want prefixes, you may set
          them to ``). See the [1006]$QTDIR variable for more information.
          Example:

env.Uic('foo.ui') # -> ['foo.h', 'uic_foo.cc', 'moc_foo.cc']
env.Uic(target = Split('include/foo.h gen/uicfoo.cc gen/mocfoo.cc'),
        source = 'foo.ui') # -> ['include/foo.h', 'gen/uicfoo.cc', 'gen/mocfoo.c
c']

   Zip() , env.Zip()
          Builds a zip archive of the specified files and/or directories.
          Unlike most builder methods, the Zip builder method may be
          called multiple times for a given target; each additional call
          adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive.
          Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any
          on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about
          them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Zip('src.zip', 'src')

# Create the stuff.zip file.
env.Zip('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
env.Zip('stuff', 'another')

   All targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources.
   An explicit dependency can be specified using the Depends method of a
   construction environment (see below).

   In addition, scons automatically scans source files for various
   programming languages, so the dependencies do not need to be specified
   explicitly. By default, SCons can C source files, C++ source files,
   Fortran source files with .F (POSIX systems only), .fpp, or .FPP file
   extensions, and assembly language files with .S (POSIX systems only),
   .spp, or .SPP files extensions for C preprocessor dependencies. SCons
   also has default support for scanning D source files, You can also
   write your own Scanners to add support for additional source file
   types. These can be added to the default Scanner object used by the
   Object(), StaticObject(), and SharedObject() Builders by adding them to
   the SourceFileScanner object. See the section "Scanner Objects" below,
   for more information about defining your own Scanner objects and using
   the SourceFileScanner object.

Methods and Functions to Do Things

   In addition to Builder methods, scons provides a number of other
   construction environment methods and global functions to manipulate the
   build configuration.

   Usually, a construction environment method and global function with the
   same name both exist so that you don't have to remember whether to a
   specific bit of functionality must be called with or without a
   construction environment. In the following list, if you call something
   as a global function it looks like:
Function(arguments)

   and if you call something through a construction environment it looks
   like:
env.Function(arguments)

   If you can call the functionality in both ways, then both forms are
   listed.

   Global functions may be called from custom Python modules that you
   import into an SConscript file by adding the following to the Python
   module:
from SCons.Script import *

   Except where otherwise noted, the same-named construction environment
   method and global function provide the exact same functionality. The
   only difference is that, where appropriate, calling the functionality
   through a construction environment will substitute construction
   variables into any supplied strings. For example:
env = Environment(FOO = 'foo')
Default('$FOO')
env.Default('$FOO')

   In the above example, the first call to the global Default() function
   will actually add a target named $FOO to the list of default targets,
   while the second call to the env.Default() construction environment
   method will expand the value and add a target named foo to the list of
   default targets. For more on construction variable expansion, see the
   next section on construction variables.

   Construction environment methods and global functions supported by
   scons include:

   Action(action, [cmd/str/fun, [var, ...]] [option=value, ...]) ,
          env.Action(action, [cmd/str/fun, [var, ...]] [option=value,
          ...])
          Creates an Action object for the specified action. See the
          manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation of
          the arguments and behavior.

          Note that the env.Action() form of the invocation will expand
          construction variables in any argument strings, including the
          action argument, at the time it is called using the construction
          variables in the env construction environment through which
          env.Action() was called. The Action() form delays all variable
          expansion until the Action object is actually used.

   AddMethod(object, function, [name]) , env.AddMethod(function, [name])
          When called with the AddMethod() form, adds the specified
          function to the specified object as the specified method name.
          When called with the env.AddMethod() form, adds the specified
          function to the construction environment env as the specified
          method name. In both cases, if name is omitted or None, the name
          of the specified function itself is used for the method name.

          Examples:

# Note that the first argument to the function to
# be attached as a method must be the object through
# which the method will be called; the Python
# convention is to call it 'self'.
def my_method(self, arg):
    print("my_method() got", arg)

# Use the global AddMethod() function to add a method
# to the Environment class.  This
AddMethod(Environment, my_method)
env = Environment()
env.my_method('arg')

# Add the function as a method, using the function
# name for the method call.
env = Environment()
env.AddMethod(my_method, 'other_method_name')
env.other_method_name('another arg')

   AddOption(arguments)
          This function adds a new command-line option to be recognized.
          The specified arguments are the same as supported by the
          add_option method in the standard Python library module
          optparse, with a few additional capabilities noted below; see
          the documentation for optparse for a thorough discussion of its
          option-processing capabities.

          In addition to the arguments and values supported by the
          optparse.add_option() method, the SCons AddOption function
          allows you to set the nargs keyword value to '?' (a string with
          just the question mark) to indicate that the specified long
          option(s) take(s) an optional argument. When nargs = '?' is
          passed to the AddOption function, the const keyword argument may
          be used to supply the "default" value that should be used when
          the option is specified on the command line without an explicit
          argument.

          If no default= keyword argument is supplied when calling
          AddOption, the option will have a default value of None.

          Unlike regular optparse, option names added via AddOption must
          be matched exactly, the automatic matching of abbreviations on
          the command line for long options is not supported. To allow
          specific abbreviations, include them in the AddOption call.

          Once a new command-line option has been added with AddOption,
          the option value may be accessed using GetOption or
          env.GetOption(). SetOption is not currently supported for
          options added with AddOption.

          Any specified help= strings for the new option(s) will be
          displayed by the -H or -h options (the latter only if no other
          help text is specified in the SConscript files). The help text
          for the local options specified by AddOption will appear below
          the SCons options themselves, under a separate Local Options
          heading. The options will appear in the help text in the order
          in which the AddOption calls occur.

          Example:

AddOption('--prefix',
          dest='prefix',
          nargs=1, type='string',
          action='store',
          metavar='DIR',
          help='installation prefix')
env = Environment(PREFIX = GetOption('prefix'))

Note

          While AddOption behaves like add_option, from the optparse
          module, the behavior of options added by AddOption which take
          arguments is underfined in scons if whitespace (rather than an =
          sign) is used as the separator on the command line when the
          option is invoked. Such usage should be avoided.

   AddPostAction(target, action) , env.AddPostAction(target, action)
          Arranges for the specified action to be performed after the
          specified target has been built. The specified action(s) may be
          an Action object, or anything that can be converted into an
          Action object See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a
          complete explanation.

          When multiple targets are supplied, the action may be called
          multiple times, once after each action that generates one or
          more targets in the list.

   AddPreAction(target, action) , env.AddPreAction(target, action)
          Arranges for the specified action to be performed before the
          specified target is built. The specified action(s) may be an
          Action object, or anything that can be converted into an Action
          object See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete
          explanation.

          When multiple targets are specified, the action(s) may be called
          multiple times, once before each action that generates one or
          more targets in the list.

          Note that if any of the targets are built in multiple steps, the
          action will be invoked just before the "final" action that
          specifically generates the specified target(s). For example,
          when building an executable program from a specified source .c
          file via an intermediate object file:

foo = Program('foo.c')
AddPreAction(foo, 'pre_action')

          The specified pre_action would be executed before scons calls
          the link command that actually generates the executable program
          binary foo, not before compiling the foo.c file into an object
          file.

   Alias(alias, [targets, [action]]) , env.Alias(alias, [targets,
          [action]])
          Creates one or more phony targets that expand to one or more
          other targets. An optional action (command) or list of actions
          can be specified that will be executed whenever the any of the
          alias targets are out-of-date. Returns the Node object
          representing the alias, which exists outside of any file system.
          This Node object, or the alias name, may be used as a dependency
          of any other target, including another alias. Alias can be
          called multiple times for the same alias to add additional
          targets to the alias, or additional actions to the list for this
          alias.

          Examples:

Alias('install')
Alias('install', '/usr/bin')
Alias(['install', 'install-lib'], '/usr/local/lib')

env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/lib'])
env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/man'])

env.Alias('update', ['file1', 'file2'], "update_database $SOURCES")

   AllowSubstExceptions([exception, ...])
          Specifies the exceptions that will be allowed when expanding
          construction variables. By default, any construction variable
          expansions that generate a NameError or IndexError exception
          will expand to a '' (a null string) and not cause scons to fail.
          All exceptions not in the specified list will generate an error
          message and terminate processing.

          If AllowSubstExceptions is called multiple times, each call
          completely overwrites the previous list of allowed exceptions.

          Example:

# Requires that all construction variable names exist.
# (You may wish to do this if you want to enforce strictly
# that all construction variables must be defined before use.)
AllowSubstExceptions()

# Also allow a string containing a zero-division expansion
# like '${1 / 0}' to evalute to ''.
AllowSubstExceptions(IndexError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError)

   AlwaysBuild(target, ...) , env.AlwaysBuild(target, ...)
          Marks each given target so that it is always assumed to be out
          of date, and will always be rebuilt if needed. Note, however,
          that AlwaysBuild does not add its target(s) to the default
          target list, so the targets will only be built if they are
          specified on the command line, or are a dependent of a target
          specified on the command line--but they will always be built if
          so specified. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call
          to AlwaysBuild.

   env.Append(key=val, [...])
          Appends the specified keyword arguments to the end of
          construction variables in the environment. If the Environment
          does not have the specified construction variable, it is simply
          added to the environment. If the values of the construction
          variable and the keyword argument are the same type, then the
          two values will be simply added together. Otherwise, the
          construction variable and the value of the keyword argument are
          both coerced to lists, and the lists are added together. (See
          also the Prepend method).

          Example:

env.Append(CCFLAGS = ' -g', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

   env.AppendENVPath(name, newpath, [envname, sep, delete_existing])
          This appends new path elements to the given path in the
          specified external environment (ENV by default). This will only
          add any particular path once (leaving the last one it encounters
          and ignoring the rest, to preserve path order), and to help
          assure this, will normalize all paths (using os.path.normpath
          and os.path.normcase). This can also handle the case where the
          given old path variable is a list instead of a string, in which
          case a list will be returned instead of a string.

          If delete_existing is 0, then adding a path that already exists
          will not move it to the end; it will stay where it is in the
          list.

          Example:

print 'before:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.AppendENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print 'after:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']

yields:
before: /foo:/biz
after: /biz:/foo/bar:/foo

   env.AppendUnique(key=val, [...], delete_existing=0)
          Appends the specified keyword arguments to the end of
          construction variables in the environment. If the Environment
          does not have the specified construction variable, it is simply
          added to the environment. If the construction variable being
          appended to is a list, then any value(s) that already exist in
          the construction variable will not be added again to the list.
          However, if delete_existing is 1, existing matching values are
          removed first, so existing values in the arg list move to the
          end of the list.

          Example:

env.AppendUnique(CCFLAGS = '-g', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

   Builder(action, [arguments]) , env.Builder(action, [arguments])
          Creates a Builder object for the specified action. See the
          manpage section "Builder Objects" for a complete explanation of
          the arguments and behavior.

          Note that the env.Builder() form of the invocation will expand
          construction variables in any arguments strings, including the
          action argument, at the time it is called using the construction
          variables in the env construction environment through which
          env.Builder() was called. The Builder form delays all variable
          expansion until after the Builder object is actually called.

   CacheDir(cache_dir) , env.CacheDir(cache_dir)
          Specifies that scons will maintain a cache of derived files in
          cache_dir. The derived files in the cache will be shared among
          all the builds using the same CacheDir call. Specifying a
          cache_dir of None disables derived file caching.

          Calling env.CacheDir() will only affect targets built through
          the specified construction environment. Calling CacheDir sets a
          global default that will be used by all targets built through
          construction environments that do not have an env.CacheDir()
          specified.

          When a CacheDir() is being used and scons finds a derived file
          that needs to be rebuilt, it will first look in the cache to see
          if a derived file has already been built from identical input
          files and an identical build action (as incorporated into the
          MD5 build signature). If so, scons will retrieve the file from
          the cache. If the derived file is not present in the cache,
          scons will rebuild it and then place a copy of the built file in
          the cache (identified by its MD5 build signature), so that it
          may be retrieved by other builds that need to build the same
          derived file from identical inputs.

          Use of a specified CacheDir may be disabled for any invocation
          by using the --cache-disable option.

          If the --cache-force option is used, scons will place a copy of
          all derived files in the cache, even if they already existed and
          were not built by this invocation. This is useful to populate a
          cache the first time CacheDir is added to a build, or after
          using the --cache-disable option.

          When using CacheDir, scons will report, "Retrieved `file' from
          cache," unless the --cache-show option is being used. When the
          --cache-show option is used, scons will print the action that
          would have been used to build the file, without any indication
          that the file was actually retrieved from the cache. This is
          useful to generate build logs that are equivalent regardless of
          whether a given derived file has been built in-place or
          retrieved from the cache.

          The [1007]NoCache method can be used to disable caching of
          specific files. This can be useful if inputs and/or outputs of
          some tool are impossible to predict or prohibitively large.

   Clean(targets, files_or_dirs) , env.Clean(targets, files_or_dirs)
          This specifies a list of files or directories which should be
          removed whenever the targets are specified with the -c command
          line option. The specified targets may be a list or an
          individual target. Multiple calls to Clean are legal, and create
          new targets or add files and directories to the clean list for
          the specified targets.

          Multiple files or directories should be specified either as
          separate arguments to the Clean method, or as a list. Clean will
          also accept the return value of any of the construction
          environment Builder methods. Examples:

          The related [1008]NoClean function overrides calling Clean for
          the same target, and any targets passed to both functions will
          not be removed by the -c option.

          Examples:

Clean('foo', ['bar', 'baz'])
Clean('dist', env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))
Clean(['foo', 'bar'], 'something_else_to_clean')

          In this example, installing the project creates a subdirectory
          for the documentation. This statement causes the subdirectory to
          be removed if the project is deinstalled.

Clean(docdir, os.path.join(docdir, projectname))

   env.Clone([key=val, ...])
          Returns a separate copy of a construction environment. If there
          are any keyword arguments specified, they are added to the
          returned copy, overwriting any existing values for the keywords.

          Example:

env2 = env.Clone()
env3 = env.Clone(CCFLAGS = '-g')

          Additionally, a list of tools and a toolpath may be specified,
          as in the Environment constructor:

def MyTool(env): env['FOO'] = 'bar'
env4 = env.Clone(tools = ['msvc', MyTool])

          The parse_flags keyword argument is also recognized to allow
          merging command-line style arguments into the appropriate
          construction variables (see [1009]env.MergeFlags).

# create an environment for compiling programs that use wxWidgets
wx_env = env.Clone(parse_flags='!wx-config --cflags --cxxflags')

   Command(target, source, action, [key=val, ...]) , env.Command(target,
          source, action, [key=val, ...])
          Executes a specific action (or list of actions) to build a
          target file or files. This is more convenient than defining a
          separate Builder object for a single special-case build.

          Command builder accepts source_scanner, target_scanner,
          source_factory, and target_factory keyword arguments. The
          *_scanner args can be used to specify a Scanner object that will
          be used to apply a custom scanner for a source or target. For
          example, the global DirScanner object can be used if any of the
          sources will be directories that must be scanned on-disk for
          changes to files that aren't already specified in other Builder
          of function calls. The *_factory args take a factory function
          that the Command will use to turn any sources or targets
          specified as strings into SCons Nodes. See the sections "Builder
          Objects" below, for more information about how these args work
          in a Builder.

          Any other keyword arguments specified override any same-named
          existing construction variables.

          An action can be an external command, specified as a string, or
          a callable Python object; see the manpage section "Action
          Objects" for more complete information. Also note that a string
          specifying an external command may be preceded by an @ (at-sign)
          to suppress printing the command in question, or by a - (hyphen)
          to ignore the exit status of the external command.

          Examples:

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            "$FOO_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET")

env.Command('bar.out', 'bar.in',
            ["rm -f $TARGET",
             "$BAR_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET"],
            ENV={'PATH': '/usr/local/bin/'})

def rename(env, target, source):
    import os
    os.rename('.tmp', str(target[0]))

env.Command('baz.out', 'baz.in',
            ["$BAZ_BUILD < $SOURCES > .tmp",
             rename])

          Note that the Command function will usually assume, by default,
          that the specified targets and/or sources are Files, if no other
          part of the configuration identifies what type of entries they
          are. If necessary, you can explicitly specify that targets or
          source nodes should be treated as directories by using the
          [1010]Dir or env.Dir functions.

          Examples:

env.Command('ddd.list', Dir('ddd'), 'ls -l $SOURCE > $TARGET')

env['DISTDIR'] = 'destination/directory'
env.Command(env.Dir('$DISTDIR')), None, make_distdir)

          Also note that SCons will usually automatically create any
          directory necessary to hold a target file, so you normally don't
          need to create directories by hand.

   Configure(env, [custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h]) ,
          env.Configure([custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h])
          Creates a Configure object for integrated functionality similar
          to GNU autoconf. See the manpage section "Configure Contexts"
          for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

   env.Copy([key=val, ...])
          A now-deprecated synonym for env.Clone().

   Decider(function) , env.Decider(function)
          Specifies that all up-to-date decisions for targets built
          through this construction environment will be handled by the
          specified function. The function can be one of the following
          strings that specify the type of decision function to be
          performed:

        timestamp-newer
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp is newer than
                the target file's timestamp. This is the behavior of the
                classic Make utility, and make can be used a synonym for
                timestamp-newer.

        timestamp-match
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp is different
                than the timestamp recorded the last time the target was
                built. This provides behavior very similar to the classic
                Make utility (in particular, files are not opened up so
                that their contents can be checksummed) except that the
                target will also be rebuilt if a dependency file has been
                restored to a version with an earlier timestamp, such as
                can happen when restoring files from backup archives.

        MD5
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's content has changed since
                the last time the target was built, as determined be
                performing an MD5 checksum on the dependency's contents
                and comparing it to the checksum recorded the last time
                the target was built. content can be used as a synonym for
                MD5.

        MD5-timestamp
                Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date
                and rebuilt if the dependency's content has changed since
                the last time the target was built, except that
                dependencies with a timestamp that matches the last time
                the target was rebuilt will be assumed to be up-to-date
                and not rebuilt. This provides behavior very similar to
                the MD5 behavior of always checksumming file contents,
                with an optimization of not checking the contents of files
                whose timestamps haven't changed. The drawback is that
                SCons will not detect if a file's content has changed but
                its timestamp is the same, as might happen in an automated
                script that runs a build, updates a file, and runs the
                build again, all within a single second.

          Examples:

# Use exact timestamp matches by default.
Decider('timestamp-match')

# Use MD5 content signatures for any targets built
# with the attached construction environment.
env.Decider('content')

          In addition to the above already-available functions, the
          function argument may be an actual Python function that takes
          the following three arguments:

        dependency
                The Node (file) which should cause the target to be
                rebuilt if it has "changed" since the last tme target was
                built.

        target
                The Node (file) being built. In the normal case, this is
                what should get rebuilt if the dependency has "changed."

        prev_ni
                Stored information about the state of the dependency the
                last time the target was built. This can be consulted to
                match various file characteristics such as the timestamp,
                size, or content signature.

        repo_node
                Use this node instead of the one specified by dependency
                to determine if the dependency has changed.

          The function should return a True (non-zero) value if the
          dependency has "changed" since the last time the target was
          built (indicating that the target should be rebuilt), and False
          (zero) otherwise (indicating that the target should not be
          rebuilt). Note that the decision can be made using whatever
          criteria are appopriate. Ignoring some or all of the function
          arguments is perfectly normal.

          Example:

def my_decider(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
    return not os.path.exists(str(target))

env.Decider(my_decider)

   Default(targets) , env.Default(targets)
          This specifies a list of default targets, which will be built by
          scons if no explicit targets are given on the command line.
          Multiple calls to Default are legal, and add to the list of
          default targets. As noted above, both forms of this call affect
          the same global list of default targets; the construction
          environment method applies construction variable expansion to
          the targets.

          Multiple targets should be specified as separate arguments to
          the Default method, or as a list. Default will also accept the
          Node returned by any of a construction environment's builder
          methods.

          Examples:

Default('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
env.Default(['a', 'b', 'c'])
hello = env.Program('hello', 'hello.c')
env.Default(hello)

          An argument to Default of None will clear all default targets.
          Later calls to Default will add to the (now empty)
          default-target list like normal.

          The current list of targets added using the Default function or
          method is available in the DEFAULT_TARGETS list; see below.

   DefaultEnvironment([**kwargs])
          Creates and returns the default construction environment object.
          The default construction environment is used internally by SCons
          in order to execute many of the global functions in this list
          (i.e. those not called as methods of a specific construction
          environment), and to fetch source files transparently from
          source code management systems. The default environment is a
          singleton, so the keyword arguments affect it only on the first
          call, on subsequent calls the already-constructed object is
          returned. The default environment can be modified in the same
          way as any construction environment.

   Depends(target, dependency) , env.Depends(target, dependency)
          Specifies an explicit dependency; the target will be rebuilt
          whenever the dependency has changed. Both the specified target
          and dependency can be a string (usually the path name of a file
          or directory) or Node objects, or a list of strings or Node
          objects (such as returned by a Builder call). This should only
          be necessary for cases where the dependency is not caught by a
          Scanner for the file.

          Example:

env.Depends('foo', 'other-input-file-for-foo')

mylib = env.Library('mylib.c')
installed_lib = env.Install('lib', mylib)
bar = env.Program('bar.c')

# Arrange for the library to be copied into the installation
# directory before trying to build the "bar" program.
# (Note that this is for example only.  A "real" library
# dependency would normally be configured through the $LIBS
# and $LIBPATH variables, not using an env.Depends() call.)

env.Depends(bar, installed_lib)

   env.Dictionary([vars])
          Returns a dictionary object containing the construction
          variables in the construction environment. If there are any
          arguments specified, the values of the specified construction
          variables are returned as a string (if one argument) or as a
          list of strings.

          Example:

cvars = env.Dictionary()
cc_values = env.Dictionary('CC', 'CCFLAGS', 'CCCOM')

   Dir(name, [directory]) , env.Dir(name, [directory])
          This returns a Directory Node, an object that represents the
          specified directory name. name can be a relative or absolute
          path. directory is an optional directory that will be used as
          the parent directory. If no directory is specified, the current
          script's directory is used as the parent.

          If name is a list, SCons returns a list of Dir nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in name.

          Directory Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string
          as a directory name to a Builder method or function. Directory
          Nodes have attributes and methods that are useful in many
          situations; see manpage section "File and Directory Nodes" for
          more information.

   env.Dump([key])
          Returns a pretty printable representation of the environment.
          key, if not None, should be a string containing the name of the
          variable of interest.

          This SConstruct:

env=Environment()
print(env.Dump('CCCOM'))

          will print:

'$CC -c -o $TARGET $CCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPDEFFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS $SOURCES'

          While this SConstruct:

env=Environment()
print(env.Dump())

          will print:

{ 'AR': 'ar',
  'ARCOM': '$AR $ARFLAGS $TARGET $SOURCES\n$RANLIB $RANLIBFLAGS $TARGET',
  'ARFLAGS': ['r'],
  'AS': 'as',
  'ASCOM': '$AS $ASFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCES',
  'ASFLAGS': [],
  ...

   EnsurePythonVersion(major, minor) , env.EnsurePythonVersion(major,
          minor)
          Ensure that the Python version is at least major.minor. This
          function will print out an error message and exit SCons with a
          non-zero exit code if the actual Python version is not late
          enough.

          Example:

EnsurePythonVersion(2,2)

   EnsureSConsVersion(major, minor, [revision]) ,
          env.EnsureSConsVersion(major, minor, [revision])
          Ensure that the SCons version is at least major.minor, or
          major.minor.revision. if revision is specified. This function
          will print out an error message and exit SCons with a non-zero
          exit code if the actual SCons version is not late enough.

          Examples:

EnsureSConsVersion(0,14)

EnsureSConsVersion(0,96,90)

   Environment([key=value, ...]) , env.Environment([key=value, ...])
          Return a new construction environment initialized with the
          specified key=value pairs.

   Execute(action, [strfunction, varlist]) , env.Execute(action,
          [strfunction, varlist])
          Executes an Action object. The specified action may be an Action
          object (see manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete
          explanation of the arguments and behavior), or it may be a
          command-line string, list of commands, or executable Python
          function, each of which will be converted into an Action object
          and then executed. The exit value of the command or return value
          of the Python function will be returned.

          Note that scons will print an error message if the executed
          action fails--that is, exits with or returns a non-zero value.
          scons will not, however, automatically terminate the build if
          the specified action fails. If you want the build to stop in
          response to a failed Execute call, you must explicitly check for
          a non-zero return value:

Execute(Copy('file.out', 'file.in'))

if Execute("mkdir sub/dir/ectory"):
    # The mkdir failed, don't try to build.
    Exit(1)

   Exit([value]) , env.Exit([value])
          This tells scons to exit immediately with the specified value. A
          default exit value of 0 (zero) is used if no value is specified.

   Export(vars) , env.Export(vars)
          This tells scons to export a list of variables from the current
          SConscript file to all other SConscript files. The exported
          variables are kept in a global collection, so subsequent calls
          to Export will over-write previous exports that have the same
          name. Multiple variable names can be passed to Export as
          separate arguments or as a list. Keyword arguments can be used
          to provide names and their values. A dictionary can be used to
          map variables to a different name when exported. Both local
          variables and global variables can be exported.

          Examples:

env = Environment()
# Make env available for all SConscript files to Import().
Export("env")

package = 'my_name'
# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:.
Export("env", "package")

# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:
Export(["env", "package"])

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export(debug = env)

# Make env available using the name debug:
Export({"debug":env})

          Note that the SConscript function supports an exports argument
          that makes it easier to to export a variable or set of variables
          to a single SConscript file. See the description of the
          SConscript function, below.

   File(name, [directory]) , env.File(name, [directory])
          This returns a File Node, an object that represents the
          specified file name. name can be a relative or absolute path.
          directory is an optional directory that will be used as the
          parent directory.

          If name is a list, SCons returns a list of File nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in name.

          File Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string as a
          file name to a Builder method or function. File Nodes have
          attributes and methods that are useful in many situations; see
          manpage section "File and Directory Nodes" for more information.

   FindFile(file, dirs) , env.FindFile(file, dirs)
          Search for file in the path specified by dirs. dirs may be a
          list of directory names or a single directory name. In addition
          to searching for files that exist in the filesystem, this
          function also searches for derived files that have not yet been
          built.

          Example:

foo = env.FindFile('foo', ['dir1', 'dir2'])

   FindInstalledFiles() , env.FindInstalledFiles()
          Returns the list of targets set up by the [1011]Install or
          [1012]InstallAs builders.

          This function serves as a convenient method to select the
          contents of a binary package.

          Example:

Install( '/bin', [ 'executable_a', 'executable_b' ] )

# will return the file node list
# [ '/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b' ]
FindInstalledFiles()

Install( '/lib', [ 'some_library' ] )

# will return the file node list
# [ '/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b', '/lib/some_library' ]
FindInstalledFiles()

   FindPathDirs(variable)
          Returns a function (actually a callable Python object) intended
          to be used as the path_function of a Scanner object. The
          returned object will look up the specified variable in a
          construction environment and treat the construction variable's
          value as a list of directory paths that should be searched (like
          [1013]$CPPPATH, [1014]$LIBPATH, etc.).

          Note that use of FindPathDirs is generally preferable to writing
          your own path_function for the following reasons: 1) The
          returned list will contain all appropriate directories found in
          source trees (when [1015]VariantDir is used) or in code
          repositories (when Repository or the -Y option are used). 2)
          scons will identify expansions of variable that evaluate to the
          same list of directories as, in fact, the same list, and avoid
          re-scanning the directories for files, when possible.

          Example:

def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    # Code to scan file contents goes here...
    return include_files

scanner = Scanner(name = 'myscanner',
                  function = my_scan,
                  path_function = FindPathDirs('MYPATH'))

   FindSourceFiles(node='"."') , env.FindSourceFiles(node='"."')
          Returns the list of nodes which serve as the source of the built
          files. It does so by inspecting the dependency tree starting at
          the optional argument node which defaults to the '"."'-node. It
          will then return all leaves of node. These are all children
          which have no further children.

          This function is a convenient method to select the contents of a
          Source Package.

          Example:

Program( 'src/main_a.c' )
Program( 'src/main_b.c' )
Program( 'main_c.c' )

# returns ['main_c.c', 'src/main_a.c', 'SConstruct', 'src/main_b.c']
FindSourceFiles()

# returns ['src/main_b.c', 'src/main_a.c' ]
FindSourceFiles( 'src' )

          As you can see build support files (SConstruct in the above
          example) will also be returned by this function.

   Flatten(sequence) , env.Flatten(sequence)
          Takes a sequence (that is, a Python list or tuple) that may
          contain nested sequences and returns a flattened list containing
          all of the individual elements in any sequence. This can be
          helpful for collecting the lists returned by calls to Builders;
          other Builders will automatically flatten lists specified as
          input, but direct Python manipulation of these lists does not.

          Examples:

foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')

# Because `foo' and `bar' are lists returned by the Object() Builder,
# `objects' will be a list containing nested lists:
objects = ['f1.o', foo, 'f2.o', bar, 'f3.o']

# Passing such a list to another Builder is all right because
# the Builder will flatten the list automatically:
Program(source = objects)

# If you need to manipulate the list directly using Python, you need to
# call Flatten() yourself, or otherwise handle nested lists:
for object in Flatten(objects):
    print str(object)

   GetBuildFailures()
          Returns a list of exceptions for the actions that failed while
          attempting to build targets. Each element in the returned list
          is a BuildError object with the following attributes that record
          various aspects of the build failure:

          .node The node that was being built when the build failure
          occurred.

          .status The numeric exit status returned by the command or
          Python function that failed when trying to build the specified
          Node.

          .errstr The SCons error string describing the build failure.
          (This is often a generic message like "Error 2" to indicate that
          an executed command exited with a status of 2.)

          .filename The name of the file or directory that actually caused
          the failure. This may be different from the .node attribute. For
          example, if an attempt to build a target named sub/dir/target
          fails because the sub/dir directory could not be created, then
          the .node attribute will be sub/dir/target but the .filename
          attribute will be sub/dir.

          .executor The SCons Executor object for the target Node being
          built. This can be used to retrieve the construction environment
          used for the failed action.

          .action The actual SCons Action object that failed. This will be
          one specific action out of the possible list of actions that
          would have been executed to build the target.

          .command The actual expanded command that was executed and
          failed, after expansion of [1016]$TARGET, [1017]$SOURCE, and
          other construction variables.

          Note that the GetBuildFailures function will always return an
          empty list until any build failure has occurred, which means
          that GetBuildFailures will always return an empty list while the
          SConscript files are being read. Its primary intended use is for
          functions that will be executed before SCons exits by passing
          them to the standard Python atexit.register() function. Example:

import atexit

def print_build_failures():
    from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
    for bf in GetBuildFailures():
        print("%s failed: %s" % (bf.node, bf.errstr))

atexit.register(print_build_failures)

   GetBuildPath(file, [...]) , env.GetBuildPath(file, [...])
          Returns the scons path name (or names) for the specified file
          (or files). The specified file or files may be scons Nodes or
          strings representing path names.

   GetLaunchDir() , env.GetLaunchDir()
          Returns the absolute path name of the directory from which scons
          was initially invoked. This can be useful when using the -u, -U
          or -D options, which internally change to the directory in which
          the SConstruct file is found.

   GetOption(name) , env.GetOption(name)
          This function provides a way to query the value of SCons options
          set on scons command line (or set using the [1018]SetOption
          function). The options supported are:

        cache_debug
                which corresponds to --cache-debug;

        cache_disable
                which corresponds to --cache-disable;

        cache_force
                which corresponds to --cache-force;

        cache_show
                which corresponds to --cache-show;

        clean
                which corresponds to -c, --clean and --remove;

        config

        directory
                which corresponds to -C and --directory;

        diskcheck
                which corresponds to --diskcheck

        duplicate
                which corresponds to --duplicate;

        file
                which corresponds to -f, --file, --makefile and
                --sconstruct;

        help
                which corresponds to -h and --help;

        ignore_errors
                which corresponds to --ignore-errors;

        implicit_cache
                which corresponds to --implicit-cache;

        implicit_deps_changed
                which corresponds to --implicit-deps-changed;

        implicit_deps_unchanged
                which corresponds to --implicit-deps-unchanged;

        interactive
                which corresponds to --interact and --interactive;

        keep_going
                which corresponds to -k and --keep-going;

        max_drift
                which corresponds to --max-drift;

        no_exec
                which corresponds to -n, --no-exec, --just-print,
                --dry-run and --recon;

        no_site_dir
                which corresponds to --no-site-dir;

        num_jobs
                which corresponds to -j and --jobs;

        profile_file
                which corresponds to --profile;

        question
                which corresponds to -q and --question;

        random
                which corresponds to --random;

        repository
                which corresponds to -Y, --repository and --srcdir;

        silent
                which corresponds to -s, --silent and --quiet;

        site_dir
                which corresponds to --site-dir;

        stack_size
                which corresponds to --stack-size;

        taskmastertrace_file
                which corresponds to --taskmastertrace; and

        warn
                which corresponds to --warn and --warning.

          See the documentation for the corresponding command line object
          for information about each specific option.

   Glob(pattern, [ondisk, source, strings, exclude]) , env.Glob(pattern,
          [ondisk, source, strings, exclude])
          Returns Nodes (or strings) that match the specified pattern,
          relative to the directory of the current SConscript file. The
          env.Glob() form performs string substition on pattern and
          returns whatever matches the resulting expanded pattern.

          The specified pattern uses Unix shell style metacharacters for
          matching:

  *       matches everything
  ?       matches any single character
  [seq]   matches any character in seq
  [!seq]  matches any char not in seq

          If the first character of a filename is a dot, it must be
          matched explicitly. Character matches do not span directory
          separators.

          The Glob knows about repositories (see the [1019]Repository
          function) and source directories (see the [1020]VariantDir
          function) and returns a Node (or string, if so configured) in
          the local (SConscript) directory if matching Node is found
          anywhere in a corresponding repository or source directory.

          The ondisk argument may be set to False (or any other non-true
          value) to disable the search for matches on disk, thereby only
          returning matches among already-configured File or Dir Nodes.
          The default behavior is to return corresponding Nodes for any
          on-disk matches found.

          The source argument may be set to True (or any equivalent value)
          to specify that, when the local directory is a VariantDir, the
          returned Nodes should be from the corresponding source
          directory, not the local directory.

          The strings argument may be set to True (or any equivalent
          value) to have the Glob function return strings, not Nodes, that
          represent the matched files or directories. The returned strings
          will be relative to the local (SConscript) directory. (Note that
          This may make it easier to perform arbitrary manipulation of
          file names, but if the returned strings are passed to a
          different SConscript file, any Node translation will be relative
          to the other SConscript directory, not the original SConscript
          directory.)

          The exclude argument may be set to a pattern or a list of
          patterns (following the same Unix shell semantics) which must be
          filtered out of returned elements. Elements matching a least one
          pattern of this list will be excluded.

          Examples:

Program('foo', Glob('*.c'))
Zip('/tmp/everything', Glob('.??*') + Glob('*'))
sources = Glob('*.cpp', exclude=['os_*_specific_*.cpp']) + Glob('os_%s_specific_
*.cpp'%currentOS)

   Help(text, append=False) , env.Help(text, append=False)
          This specifies help text to be printed if the -h argument is
          given to scons. If Help is called multiple times, the text is
          appended together in the order that Help is called. With append
          set to False, any Help text generated with AddOption is
          clobbered. If append is True, the AddOption help is prepended to
          the help string, thus preserving the -h message.

   Ignore(target, dependency) , env.Ignore(target, dependency)
          The specified dependency file(s) will be ignored when deciding
          if the target file(s) need to be rebuilt.

          You can also use Ignore to remove a target from the default
          build. In order to do this you must specify the directory the
          target will be built in as the target, and the file you want to
          skip building as the dependency.

          Note that this will only remove the dependencies listed from the
          files built by default. It will still be built if that
          dependency is needed by another object being built. See the
          third and forth examples below.

          Examples:

env.Ignore('foo', 'foo.c')
env.Ignore('bar', ['bar1.h', 'bar2.h'])
env.Ignore('.','foobar.obj')
env.Ignore('bar','bar/foobar.obj')

   Import(vars) , env.Import(vars)
          This tells scons to import a list of variables into the current
          SConscript file. This will import variables that were exported
          with Export or in the exports argument to [1021]SConscript.
          Variables exported by SConscript have precedence. Multiple
          variable names can be passed to Import as separate arguments or
          as a list. The variable "*" can be used to import all variables.

          Examples:

Import("env")
Import("env", "variable")
Import(["env", "variable"])
Import("*")

   Literal(string) , env.Literal(string)
          The specified string will be preserved as-is and not have
          construction variables expanded.

   Local(targets) , env.Local(targets)
          The specified targets will have copies made in the local tree,
          even if an already up-to-date copy exists in a repository.
          Returns a list of the target Node or Nodes.

   env.MergeFlags(arg, [unique])
          Merges the specified arg values to the construction
          environment's construction variables. If the arg argument is not
          a dictionary, it is converted to one by calling
          [1022]env.ParseFlags on the argument before the values are
          merged. Note that arg must be a single value, so multiple
          strings must be passed in as a list, not as separate arguments
          to env.MergeFlags.

          By default, duplicate values are eliminated; you can, however,
          specify unique=0 to allow duplicate values to be added. When
          eliminating duplicate values, any construction variables that
          end with the string PATH keep the left-most unique value. All
          other construction variables keep the right-most unique value.

          Examples:

# Add an optimization flag to $CCFLAGS.
env.MergeFlags('-O3')

# Combine the flags returned from running pkg-config with an optimization
# flag and merge the result into the construction variables.
env.MergeFlags(['!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags', '-O3'])

# Combine an optimization flag with the flags returned from running pkg-config
# twice and merge the result into the construction variables.
env.MergeFlags(['-O3',
               '!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags --libs',
               '!pkg-config libpng12 --cflags --libs'])

   NoCache(target, ...) , env.NoCache(target, ...)
          Specifies a list of files which should not be cached whenever
          the [1023]CacheDir method has been activated. The specified
          targets may be a list or an individual target.

          Multiple files should be specified either as separate arguments
          to the NoCache method, or as a list. NoCache will also accept
          the return value of any of the construction environment Builder
          methods.

          Calling NoCache on directories and other non-File Node types has
          no effect because only File Nodes are cached.

          Examples:

NoCache('foo.elf')
NoCache(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

   NoClean(target, ...) , env.NoClean(target, ...)
          Specifies a list of files or directories which should not be
          removed whenever the targets (or their dependencies) are
          specified with the -c command line option. The specified targets
          may be a list or an individual target. Multiple calls to NoClean
          are legal, and prevent each specified target from being removed
          by calls to the -c option.

          Multiple files or directories should be specified either as
          separate arguments to the NoClean method, or as a list. NoClean
          will also accept the return value of any of the construction
          environment Builder methods.

          Calling NoClean for a target overrides calling [1024]Clean for
          the same target, and any targets passed to both functions will
          not be removed by the -c option.

          Examples:

NoClean('foo.elf')
NoClean(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

   env.ParseConfig(command, [function, unique])
          Calls the specified function to modify the environment as
          specified by the output of command. The default function is
          [1025]env.MergeFlags, which expects the output of a typical
          *-config command (for example, gtk-config) and adds the options
          to the appropriate construction variables. By default, duplicate
          values are not added to any construction variables; you can
          specify unique=0 to allow duplicate values to be added.

          Interpreted options and the construction variables they affect
          are as specified for the [1026]env.ParseFlags method (which this
          method calls). See that method's description for a table of
          options and construction variables.

   ParseDepends(filename, [must_exist, only_one]) ,
          env.ParseDepends(filename, [must_exist, only_one])
          Parses the contents of the specified filename as a list of
          dependencies in the style of Make or mkdep, and explicitly
          establishes all of the listed dependencies.

          By default, it is not an error if the specified filename does
          not exist. The optional must_exist argument may be set to a
          non-zero value to have scons throw an exception and generate an
          error if the file does not exist, or is otherwise inaccessible.

          The optional only_one argument may be set to a non-zero value to
          have scons thrown an exception and generate an error if the file
          contains dependency information for more than one target. This
          can provide a small sanity check for files intended to be
          generated by, for example, the gcc -M flag, which should
          typically only write dependency information for one output file
          into a corresponding .d file.

          The filename and all of the files listed therein will be
          interpreted relative to the directory of the SConscript file
          which calls the ParseDepends function.

   env.ParseFlags(flags, ...)
          Parses one or more strings containing typical command-line flags
          for GCC tool chains and returns a dictionary with the flag
          values separated into the appropriate SCons construction
          variables. This is intended as a companion to the
          [1027]env.MergeFlags method, but allows for the values in the
          returned dictionary to be modified, if necessary, before merging
          them into the construction environment. (Note that
          env.MergeFlags will call this method if its argument is not a
          dictionary, so it is usually not necessary to call
          [1028]env.ParseFlags directly unless you want to manipulate the
          values.)

          If the first character in any string is an exclamation mark (!),
          the rest of the string is executed as a command, and the output
          from the command is parsed as GCC tool chain command-line flags
          and added to the resulting dictionary.

          Flag values are translated accordig to the prefix found, and
          added to the following construction variables:

-arch                   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-D                      CPPDEFINES
-framework              FRAMEWORKS
-frameworkdir=          FRAMEWORKPATH
-fmerge-all-constants   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-fopenmp                CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-include                CCFLAGS
-imacros                CCFLAGS
-isysroot               CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-isystem                CCFLAGS
-iquote                 CCFLAGS
-idirafter              CCFLAGS
-I                      CPPPATH
-l                      LIBS
-L                      LIBPATH
-mno-cygwin             CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-mwindows               LINKFLAGS
-openmp                 CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-pthread                CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-std=                   CFLAGS
-Wa,                    ASFLAGS, CCFLAGS
-Wl,-rpath=             RPATH
-Wl,-R,                 RPATH
-Wl,-R                  RPATH
-Wl,                    LINKFLAGS
-Wp,                    CPPFLAGS
-                       CCFLAGS
+                       CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS

          Any other strings not associated with options are assumed to be
          the names of libraries and added to the $LIBS construction
          variable.

          Examples (all of which produce the same result):

dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2 -Dfoo -Dbar=1')
dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '-Dfoo', '-Dbar=1')
dict = env.ParseFlags(['-O2', '-Dfoo -Dbar=1'])
dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '!echo -Dfoo -Dbar=1')

   Platform(string)
          The Platform form returns a callable object that can be used to
          initialize a construction environment using the platform keyword
          of the Environment function.

          Example:

env = Environment(platform = Platform('win32'))

          The env.Platform form applies the callable object for the
          specified platform string to the environment through which the
          method was called.

env.Platform('posix')

          Note that the win32 platform adds the SystemDrive and SystemRoot
          variables from the user's external environment to the
          construction environment's [1029]$ENV dictionary. This is so
          that any executed commands that use sockets to connect with
          other systems (such as fetching source files from external CVS
          repository specifications like
          :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/scons) will work
          on Windows systems.

   Precious(target, ...) , env.Precious(target, ...)
          Marks each given target as precious so it is not deleted before
          it is rebuilt. Normally scons deletes a target before building
          it. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call to
          Precious.

   env.Prepend(key=val, [...])
          Appends the specified keyword arguments to the beginning of
          construction variables in the environment. If the Environment
          does not have the specified construction variable, it is simply
          added to the environment. If the values of the construction
          variable and the keyword argument are the same type, then the
          two values will be simply added together. Otherwise, the
          construction variable and the value of the keyword argument are
          both coerced to lists, and the lists are added together. (See
          also the Append method, above.)

          Example:

env.Prepend(CCFLAGS = '-g ', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

   env.PrependENVPath(name, newpath, [envname, sep, delete_existing])
          This appends new path elements to the given path in the
          specified external environment ($ENV by default). This will only
          add any particular path once (leaving the first one it
          encounters and ignoring the rest, to preserve path order), and
          to help assure this, will normalize all paths (using
          os.path.normpath and os.path.normcase). This can also handle the
          case where the given old path variable is a list instead of a
          string, in which case a list will be returned instead of a
          string.

          If delete_existing is 0, then adding a path that already exists
          will not move it to the beginning; it will stay where it is in
          the list.

          Example:

print 'before:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.PrependENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print 'after:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']

          The above example will print:

before: /biz:/foo
after: /foo/bar:/foo:/biz

   env.PrependUnique(key=val, delete_existing=0, [...])
          Appends the specified keyword arguments to the beginning of
          construction variables in the environment. If the Environment
          does not have the specified construction variable, it is simply
          added to the environment. If the construction variable being
          appended to is a list, then any value(s) that already exist in
          the construction variable will not be added again to the list.
          However, if delete_existing is 1, existing matching values are
          removed first, so existing values in the arg list move to the
          front of the list.

          Example:

env.PrependUnique(CCFLAGS = '-g', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

   Progress(callable, [interval]) , Progress(string, [interval, file,
          overwrite]) , Progress(list_of_strings, [interval, file,
          overwrite])
          Allows SCons to show progress made during the build by
          displaying a string or calling a function while evaluating Nodes
          (e.g. files).

          If the first specified argument is a Python callable (a function
          or an object that has a __call__() method), the function will be
          called once every interval times a Node is evaluated. The
          callable will be passed the evaluated Node as its only argument.
          (For future compatibility, it's a good idea to also add *args
          and **kw as arguments to your function or method. This will
          prevent the code from breaking if SCons ever changes the
          interface to call the function with additional arguments in the
          future.)

          An example of a simple custom progress function that prints a
          string containing the Node name every 10 Nodes:

def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kw):
    print('Evaluating node %s!' % node)
Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)

          A more complicated example of a custom progress display object
          that prints a string containing a count every 100 evaluated
          Nodes. Note the use of \r (a carriage return) at the end so that
          the string will overwrite itself on a display:

import sys
class ProgressCounter(object):
    count = 0
    def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
        self.count += 100
        sys.stderr.write('Evaluated %s nodes\r' % self.count)
Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)

          If the first argument [1030]Progress is a string, the string
          will be displayed every interval evaluated Nodes. The default is
          to print the string on standard output; an alternate output
          stream may be specified with the file= argument. The following
          will print a series of dots on the error output, one dot for
          every 100 evaluated Nodes:

import sys
Progress('.', interval=100, file=sys.stderr)

          If the string contains the verbatim substring $TARGET, it will
          be replaced with the Node. Note that, for performance reasons,
          this is not a regular SCons variable substition, so you can not
          use other variables or use curly braces. The following example
          will print the name of every evaluated Node, using a \r
          (carriage return) to cause each line to overwritten by the next
          line, and the overwrite= keyword argument to make sure the
          previously-printed file name is overwritten with blank spaces:

import sys
Progress('$TARGET\r', overwrite=True)

          If the first argument to Progress is a list of strings, then
          each string in the list will be displayed in rotating fashion
          every interval evaluated Nodes. This can be used to implement a
          "spinner" on the user's screen as follows:

Progress(['-\r', '\\\r', '|\r', '/\r'], interval=5)

   Pseudo(target, ...) , env.Pseudo(target, ...)
          This indicates that each given target should not be created by
          the build rule, and if the target is created, an error will be
          generated. This is similar to the gnu make .PHONY target.
          However, in the vast majority of cases, an Alias is more
          appropriate. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call
          to Pseudo.

   PyPackageDir(modulename) , env.PyPackageDir(modulename)
          This returns a Directory Node similar to Dir. The python module
          / package is looked up and if located the directory is returned
          for the location. modulename Is a named python package / module
          to lookup the directory for it's location.

          If modulename is a list, SCons returns a list of Dir nodes.
          Construction variables are expanded in modulename.

   env.Replace(key=val, [...])
          Replaces construction variables in the Environment with the
          specified keyword arguments.

          Example:

env.Replace(CCFLAGS = '-g', FOO = 'foo.xxx')

   Repository(directory) , env.Repository(directory)
          Specifies that directory is a repository to be searched for
          files. Multiple calls to Repository are legal, and each one adds
          to the list of repositories that will be searched.

          To scons, a repository is a copy of the source tree, from the
          top-level directory on down, which may contain both source files
          and derived files that can be used to build targets in the local
          source tree. The canonical example would be an official source
          tree maintained by an integrator. If the repository contains
          derived files, then the derived files should have been built
          using scons, so that the repository contains the necessary
          signature information to allow scons to figure out when it is
          appropriate to use the repository copy of a derived file,
          instead of building one locally.

          Note that if an up-to-date derived file already exists in a
          repository, scons will not make a copy in the local directory
          tree. In order to guarantee that a local copy will be made, use
          the [1031]Local method.

   Requires(target, prerequisite) , env.Requires(target, prerequisite)
          Specifies an order-only relationship between the specified
          target file(s) and the specified prerequisite file(s). The
          prerequisite file(s) will be (re)built, if necessary, before the
          target file(s), but the target file(s) do not actually depend on
          the prerequisites and will not be rebuilt simply because the
          prerequisite file(s) change.

          Example:

env.Requires('foo', 'file-that-must-be-built-before-foo')

   Return([vars..., stop=])
          By default, this stops processing the current SConscript file
          and returns to the calling SConscript file the values of the
          variables named in the vars string arguments. Multiple strings
          contaning variable names may be passed to Return. Any strings
          that contain white space

          The optional stop= keyword argument may be set to a false value
          to continue processing the rest of the SConscript file after the
          Return call. This was the default behavior prior to SCons 0.98.
          However, the values returned are still the values of the
          variables in the named vars at the point Return is called.

          Examples:

# Returns without returning a value.
Return()

# Returns the value of the 'foo' Python variable.
Return("foo")

# Returns the values of the Python variables 'foo' and 'bar'.
Return("foo", "bar")

# Returns the values of Python variables 'val1' and 'val2'.
Return('val1 val2')

   Scanner(function, [argument, keys, path_function, node_class,
          node_factory, scan_check, recursive]) , env.Scanner(function,
          [argument, keys, path_function, node_class, node_factory,
          scan_check, recursive])
          Creates a Scanner object for the specified function. See manpage
          section "Scanner Objects" for a complete explanation of the
          arguments and behavior.

   SConscript(scripts, [exports, variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist]) ,
          env.SConscript(scripts, [exports, variant_dir, duplicate,
          must_exist]) , SConscript(dirs=subdirs, [name=script, exports,
          variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist]) ,
          env.SConscript(dirs=subdirs, [name=script, exports, variant_dir,
          duplicate, must_exist])
          This tells scons to execute one or more subsidiary SConscript
          (configuration) files. Any variables returned by a called script
          using [1032]Return will be returned by the call to SConscript.
          There are two ways to call the SConscript function.

          The first way you can call SConscript is to explicitly specify
          one or more scripts as the first argument. A single script may
          be specified as a string; multiple scripts must be specified as
          a list (either explicitly or as created by a function like
          Split). Examples:

SConscript('SConscript')      # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript('src/SConscript')  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(['src/SConscript', 'doc/SConscript'])
config = SConscript('MyConfig.py')

          The second way you can call SConscript is to specify a list of
          (sub)directory names as a dirs=subdirs keyword argument. In this
          case, scons will, by default, execute a subsidiary configuration
          file named SConscript in each of the specified directories. You
          may specify a name other than SConscript by supplying an
          optional name=script keyword argument. The first three examples
          below have the same effect as the first three examples above:

SConscript(dirs='.')      # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(dirs='src')    # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(dirs=['src', 'doc'])
SConscript(dirs=['sub1', 'sub2'], name='MySConscript')

          The optional exports argument provides a list of variable names
          or a dictionary of named values to export to the script(s).
          These variables are locally exported only to the specified
          script(s), and do not affect the global pool of variables used
          by the Export function. The subsidiary script(s) must use the
          [1033]Import function to import the variables. Examples:

foo = SConscript('sub/SConscript', exports='env')
SConscript('dir/SConscript', exports=['env', 'variable'])
SConscript(dirs='subdir', exports='env variable')
SConscript(dirs=['one', 'two', 'three'], exports='shared_info')

          If the optional variant_dir argument is present, it causes an
          effect equivalent to the [1034]VariantDir method described
          below. (If variant_dir is not present, the duplicate argument is
          ignored.) The variant_dir argument is interpreted relative to
          the directory of the calling SConscript file. See the
          description of the VariantDir function below for additional
          details and restrictions.

          If variant_dir is present, the source directory is the directory
          in which the SConscript file resides and the SConscript file is
          evaluated as if it were in the variant_dir directory:

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir = 'build')

          is equivalent to

VariantDir('build', 'src')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

          This later paradigm is often used when the sources are in the
          same directory as the SConstruct:

SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir = 'build')

          is equivalent to

VariantDir('build', '.')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

          The optional must_exist argument, if true, causes an exception
          to be raised if a requested SConscript file is not found. The
          current default is false, causing only a warning to be omitted,
          but this behavior is deprecated. For scripts which truly intend
          to be optional, transition to explicty supplying
          must_exist=False to the call.

          Here are some composite examples:

# collect the configuration information and use it to build src and doc
shared_info = SConscript('MyConfig.py')
SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='shared_info')
SConscript('doc/SConscript', exports='shared_info')

# build debugging and production versions.  SConscript
# can use Dir('.').path to determine variant.
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0)
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0)

# build debugging and production versions.  SConscript
# is passed flags to use.
opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['DEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-pgdb' }
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0, exports=opts)
opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['NODEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-O' }
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0, exports=opts)

# build common documentation and compile for different architectures
SConscript('doc/SConscript', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/x86', duplicate=0)
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/ppc', duplicate=0)

   SConscriptChdir(value) , env.SConscriptChdir(value)
          By default, scons changes its working directory to the directory
          in which each subsidiary SConscript file lives. This behavior
          may be disabled by specifying either:

SConscriptChdir(0)
env.SConscriptChdir(0)

          in which case scons will stay in the top-level directory while
          reading all SConscript files. (This may be necessary when
          building from repositories, when all the directories in which
          SConscript files may be found don't necessarily exist locally.)
          You may enable and disable this ability by calling
          SConscriptChdir() multiple times.

          Example:

env = Environment()
SConscriptChdir(0)
SConscript('foo/SConscript')    # will not chdir to foo
env.SConscriptChdir(1)
SConscript('bar/SConscript')    # will chdir to bar

   SConsignFile([file, dbm_module]) , env.SConsignFile([file, dbm_module])
          This tells scons to store all file signatures in the specified
          database file. If the file name is omitted, .sconsign is used by
          default. (The actual file name(s) stored on disk may have an
          appropriated suffix appended by the dbm_module.) If file is not
          an absolute path name, the file is placed in the same directory
          as the top-level SConstruct file.

          If file is None, then scons will store file signatures in a
          separate .sconsign file in each directory, not in one global
          database file. (This was the default behavior prior to SCons
          0.96.91 and 0.97.)

          The optional dbm_module argument can be used to specify which
          Python database module The default is to use a custom
          SCons.dblite module that uses pickled Python data structures,
          and which works on all Python versions.

          Examples:

# Explicitly stores signatures in ".sconsign.dblite"
# in the top-level SConstruct directory (the
# default behavior).
SConsignFile()

# Stores signatures in the file "etc/scons-signatures"
# relative to the top-level SConstruct directory.
SConsignFile("etc/scons-signatures")

# Stores signatures in the specified absolute file name.
SConsignFile("/home/me/SCons/signatures")

# Stores signatures in a separate .sconsign file
# in each directory.
SConsignFile(None)

   env.SetDefault(key=val, [...])
          Sets construction variables to default values specified with the
          keyword arguments if (and only if) the variables are not already
          set. The following statements are equivalent:

env.SetDefault(FOO = 'foo')

if 'FOO' not in env: env['FOO'] = 'foo'

   SetOption(name, value) , env.SetOption(name, value)
          This function provides a way to set a select subset of the scons
          command line options from a SConscript file. The options
          supported are:

        clean
                which corresponds to -c, --clean and --remove;

        duplicate
                which corresponds to --duplicate;

        help
                which corresponds to -h and --help;

        implicit_cache
                which corresponds to --implicit-cache;

        max_drift
                which corresponds to --max-drift;

        no_exec
                which corresponds to -n, --no-exec, --just-print,
                --dry-run and --recon;

        num_jobs
                which corresponds to -j and --jobs;

        random
                which corresponds to --random; and

        silent
                which corresponds to --silent.

        stack_size
                which corresponds to --stack-size.

          See the documentation for the corresponding command line object
          for information about each specific option.

          Example:

SetOption('max_drift', 1)

   SideEffect(side_effect, target) , env.SideEffect(side_effect, target)
          Declares side_effect as a side effect of building target. Both
          side_effect and target can be a list, a file name, or a node. A
          side effect is a target file that is created or updated as a
          side effect of building other targets. For example, a Windows
          PDB file is created as a side effect of building the .obj files
          for a static library, and various log files are created updated
          as side effects of various TeX commands. If a target is a side
          effect of multiple build commands, scons will ensure that only
          one set of commands is executed at a time. Consequently, you
          only need to use this method for side-effect targets that are
          built as a result of multiple build commands.

          Because multiple build commands may update the same side effect
          file, by default the side_effect target is not automatically
          removed when the target is removed by the -c option. (Note,
          however, that the side_effect might be removed as part of
          cleaning the directory in which it lives.) If you want to make
          sure the side_effect is cleaned whenever a specific target is
          cleaned, you must specify this explicitly with the [1035]Clean
          or env.Clean function.

   SourceCode(entries, builder) , env.SourceCode(entries, builder)
          This function and its associate factory functions are
          deprecated. There is no replacement. The intended use was to
          keep a local tree in sync with an archive, but in actuality the
          function only causes the archive to be fetched on the first run.
          Synchronizing with the archive is best done external to SCons.

          Arrange for non-existent source files to be fetched from a
          source code management system using the specified builder. The
          specified entries may be a Node, string or list of both, and may
          represent either individual source files or directories in which
          source files can be found.

          For any non-existent source files, scons will search up the
          directory tree and use the first SourceCode builder it finds.
          The specified builder may be None, in which case scons will not
          use a builder to fetch source files for the specified entries,
          even if a SourceCode builder has been specified for a directory
          higher up the tree.

          scons will, by default, fetch files from SCCS or RCS
          subdirectories without explicit configuration. This takes some
          extra processing time to search for the necessary source code
          management files on disk. You can avoid these extra searches and
          speed up your build a little by disabling these searches as
          follows:

env.SourceCode('.', None)

          Note that if the specified builder is one you create by hand, it
          must have an associated construction environment to use when
          fetching a source file.

          scons provides a set of canned factory functions that return
          appropriate Builders for various popular source code management
          systems. Canonical examples of invocation include:

env.SourceCode('.', env.BitKeeper('/usr/local/BKsources'))
env.SourceCode('src', env.CVS('/usr/local/CVSROOT'))
env.SourceCode('/', env.RCS())
env.SourceCode(['f1.c', 'f2.c'], env.SCCS())
env.SourceCode('no_source.c', None)

   Split(arg) , env.Split(arg)
          Returns a list of file names or other objects. If arg is a
          string, it will be split on strings of white-space characters
          within the string, making it easier to write long lists of file
          names. If arg is already a list, the list will be returned
          untouched. If arg is any other type of object, it will be
          returned as a list containing just the object.

          Example:

files = Split("f1.c f2.c f3.c")
files = env.Split("f4.c f5.c f6.c")
files = Split("""
        f7.c
        f8.c
        f9.c
""")

   env.subst(input, [raw, target, source, conv])
          Performs construction variable interpolation on the specified
          string or sequence argument input.

          By default, leading or trailing white space will be removed from
          the result. and all sequences of white space will be compressed
          to a single space character. Additionally, any $( and $)
          character sequences will be stripped from the returned string,
          The optional raw argument may be set to 1 if you want to
          preserve white space and $(-$) sequences. The raw argument may
          be set to 2 if you want to strip all characters between any $(
          and $) pairs (as is done for signature calculation).

          If the input is a sequence (list or tuple), the individual
          elements of the sequence will be expanded, and the results will
          be returned as a list.

          The optional target and source keyword arguments must be set to
          lists of target and source nodes, respectively, if you want the
          $TARGET, $TARGETS, $SOURCE and $SOURCES to be available for
          expansion. This is usually necessary if you are calling
          env.subst from within a Python function used as an SCons action.

          Returned string values or sequence elements are converted to
          their string representation by default. The optional conv
          argument may specify a conversion function that will be used in
          place of the default. For example, if you want Python objects
          (including SCons Nodes) to be returned as Python objects, you
          can use the Python L idiom to pass in an unnamed function that
          simply returns its unconverted argument.

          Example:

print(env.subst("The C compiler is: $CC"))

def compile(target, source, env):
    sourceDir = env.subst("${SOURCE.srcdir}",
                          target=target,
                          source=source)

source_nodes = env.subst('$EXPAND_TO_NODELIST',
                         conv=lambda x: x)

   Tag(node, tags)
          Annotates file or directory Nodes with information about how the
          [1036]Package Builder should package those files or directories.
          All tags are optional.

          Examples:

# makes sure the built library will be installed with 0o644 file
# access mode
Tag( Library( 'lib.c' ), UNIX_ATTR="0o644" )

# marks file2.txt to be a documentation file
Tag( 'file2.txt', DOC )

   Tool(string, [toolpath, **kw]) , env.Tool(string, [toolpath, **kw])
          The Tool form of the function returns a callable object that can
          be used to initialize a construction environment using the tools
          keyword of the Environment() method. The object may be called
          with a construction environment as an argument, in which case
          the object will add the necessary variables to the construction
          environment and the name of the tool will be added to the
          [1037]$TOOLS construction variable.

          Additional keyword arguments are passed to the tool's generate()
          method.

          Examples:

env = Environment(tools = [ Tool('msvc') ])

env = Environment()
t = Tool('msvc')
t(env)  # adds 'msvc' to the TOOLS variable
u = Tool('opengl', toolpath = ['tools'])
u(env)  # adds 'opengl' to the TOOLS variable

          The env.Tool form of the function applies the callable object
          for the specified tool string to the environment through which
          the method was called.

          Additional keyword arguments are passed to the tool's generate()
          method.

env.Tool('gcc')
env.Tool('opengl', toolpath = ['build/tools'])

   Value(value, [built_value]) , env.Value(value, [built_value])
          Returns a Node object representing the specified Python value.
          Value Nodes can be used as dependencies of targets. If the
          result of calling str(value) changes between SCons runs, any
          targets depending on Value(value) will be rebuilt. (This is true
          even when using timestamps to decide if files are up-to-date.)
          When using timestamp source signatures, Value Nodes' timestamps
          are equal to the system time when the Node is created.

          The returned Value Node object has a write() method that can be
          used to "build" a Value Node by setting a new value. The
          optional built_value argument can be specified when the Value
          Node is created to indicate the Node should already be
          considered "built." There is a corresponding read() method that
          will return the built value of the Node.

          Examples:

env = Environment()

def create(target, source, env):
    # A function that will write a 'prefix=$SOURCE'
    # string into the file name specified as the
    # $TARGET.
    f = open(str(target[0]), 'wb')
    f.write('prefix=' + source[0].get_contents())

# Fetch the prefix= argument, if any, from the command
# line, and use /usr/local as the default.
prefix = ARGUMENTS.get('prefix', '/usr/local')

# Attach a .Config() builder for the above function action
# to the construction environment.
env['BUILDERS']['Config'] = Builder(action = create)
env.Config(target = 'package-config', source = Value(prefix))

def build_value(target, source, env):
    # A function that "builds" a Python Value by updating
    # the the Python value with the contents of the file
    # specified as the source of the Builder call ($SOURCE).
    target[0].write(source[0].get_contents())

output = env.Value('before')
input = env.Value('after')

# Attach a .UpdateValue() builder for the above function
# action to the construction environment.
env['BUILDERS']['UpdateValue'] = Builder(action = build_value)
env.UpdateValue(target = Value(output), source = Value(input))

   VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate]) ,
          env.VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])
          Use the VariantDir function to create a copy of your sources in
          another location: if a name under variant_dir is not found but
          exists under src_dir, the file or directory is copied to
          variant_dir. Target files can be built in a different directory
          than the original sources by simply refering to the sources (and
          targets) within the variant tree.

          VariantDir can be called multiple times with the same src_dir to
          set up multiple builds with different options (variants). The
          src_dir location must be in or underneath the SConstruct file's
          directory, and variant_dir may not be underneath src_dir.

          The default behavior is for scons to physically duplicate the
          source files in the variant tree. Thus, a build performed in the
          variant tree is guaranteed to be identical to a build performed
          in the source tree even if intermediate source files are
          generated during the build, or preprocessors or other scanners
          search for included files relative to the source file, or
          individual compilers or other invoked tools are hard-coded to
          put derived files in the same directory as source files.

          If possible on the platform, the duplication is performed by
          linking rather than copying; see also the --duplicate
          command-line option. Moreover, only the files needed for the
          build are duplicated; files and directories that are not used
          are not present in variant_dir.

          Duplicating the source tree may be disabled by setting the
          duplicate argument to 0 (zero). This will cause scons to invoke
          Builders using the path names of source files in src_dir and the
          path names of derived files within variant_dir. This is always
          more efficient than duplicate=1, and is usually safe for most
          builds (but see above for cases that may cause problems).

          Note that VariantDir works most naturally with a subsidiary
          SConscript file. However, you would then call the subsidiary
          SConscript file not in the source directory, but in the
          variant_dir, regardless of the value of duplicate. This is how
          you tell scons which variant of a source tree to build:

# run src/SConscript in two variant directories
VariantDir('build/variant1', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant1/SConscript')
VariantDir('build/variant2', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant2/SConscript')

          See also the [1038]SConscript function, described above, for
          another way to specify a variant directory in conjunction with
          calling a subsidiary SConscript file.

          Examples:

# use names in the build directory, not the source directory
VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=0)
Program('build/prog', 'build/source.c')

# this builds both the source and docs in a separate subtree
VariantDir('build', '.', duplicate=0)
SConscript(dirs=['build/src','build/doc'])

# same as previous example, but only uses SConscript
SConscript(dirs='src', variant_dir='build/src', duplicate=0)
SConscript(dirs='doc', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)

   WhereIs(program, [path, pathext, reject]) , env.WhereIs(program, [path,
          pathext, reject])
          Searches for the specified executable program, returning the
          full path name to the program if it is found, else None.
          Searches the value of the path keyword argument, or if None (the
          default) the value of the calling environment's PATH
          (env['ENV']['PATH']). If path is None and the env['ENV']['PATH']
          key does not exist, the user's current external PATH
          (os.environ['PATH']) is used as fallback.

          On Windows systems, searches for executable programs with any of
          the file extensions listed in the pathext keyword argument, or
          if None (the default) the calling environment's PATHEXT
          (env['ENV']['PATHEXT']). The user's current external PATHEXT
          (os.environ['PATHEXT']) is used as a fallback if pathext is None
          and the key env['ENV']['PATHEXT'] does not exist.

          Will not select any path name or names in the specified reject
          list, if any.

Note

          If you would prefer to search the user's current external PATH
          (os.environ['PATH']) by default, consider using the function
          SCons.Util.WhereIs instead. Note that SCons.Util.WhereIs does
          not expand environment variables automatically (no implicit
          env.subst for its arguments).

SConscript Variables

   In addition to the global functions and methods, scons supports a
   number of Python variables that can be used in SConscript files to
   affect how you want the build to be performed. These variables may be
   accessed from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript
   file by adding the following to the Python module:
from SCons.Script import *

   ARGLIST
          A list keyword=value arguments specified on the command line.
          Each element in the list is a tuple containing the
          (keyword,value) of the argument. The separate keyword and value
          elements of the tuple can be accessed by subscripting for
          element [0] and [1] of the tuple, respectively.

          Example:

print("first keyword, value =", ARGLIST[0][0], ARGLIST[0][1])
print("second keyword, value =", ARGLIST[1][0], ARGLIST[1][1])
third_tuple = ARGLIST[2]
print("third keyword, value =", third_tuple[0], third_tuple[1])
for key, value in ARGLIST:
    # process key and value

   ARGUMENTS
          A dictionary of all the keyword=value arguments specified on the
          command line. The dictionary is not in order, and if a given
          keyword has more than one value assigned to it on the command
          line, the last (right-most) value is the one in the ARGUMENTS
          dictionary.

          Example:

if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')
else:
    env = Environment()

   BUILD_TARGETS
          A list of the targets which scons will actually try to build,
          regardless of whether they were specified on the command line or
          via the Default() function or method. The elements of this list
          may be strings or nodes, so you should run the list through the
          Python str function to make sure any Node path names are
          converted to strings.

          Because this list may be taken from the list of targets
          specified using the Default() function or method, the contents
          of the list may change on each successive call to Default(). See
          the DEFAULT_TARGETS list, below, for additional information.

          Example:

if 'foo' in BUILD_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
if 'special/program' in BUILD_TARGETS:
    SConscript('special')

   Note that the BUILD_TARGETS list only contains targets expected listed
   on the command line or via calls to the Default() function or method.
   It does not contain all dependent targets that will be built as a
   result of making the sure the explicitly-specified targets are up to
   date.

   COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS
          A list of the targets explicitly specified on the command line.
          If there are no targets specified on the command line, the list
          is empty. This can be used, for example, to take specific
          actions only when a certain target or targets is explicitly
          being built.

          Example:

if 'foo' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
if 'special/program' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    SConscript('special')

   DEFAULT_TARGETS
          A list of the target nodes that have been specified using the
          Default() function or method. The elements of the list are
          nodes, so you need to run them through the Python str function
          to get at the path name for each Node.

          Example:

print(str(DEFAULT_TARGETS[0]))
if 'foo' in [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS]:
    print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")

   The contents of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list change on on each successive
   call to the Default() function:
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # originally []
Default('foo')
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo']
Default('bar')
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo', 'bar']
Default(None)
print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # back to []

   Consequently, be sure to use DEFAULT_TARGETS only after you've made all
   of your Default() calls, or else simply be careful of the order of
   these statements in your SConscript files so that you don't look for a
   specific default target before it's actually been added to the list.

Construction Variables

   A construction environment has an associated dictionary of construction
   variables that are used by built-in or user-supplied build rules.
   Construction variables must follow the same rules for Python
   identifiers: the initial character must be an underscore or letter,
   followed by any number of underscores, letters, or digits.

   A number of useful construction variables are automatically defined by
   scons for each supported platform, and additional construction
   variables can be defined by the user. The following is a list of the
   automatically defined construction variables:

   __LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          This construction variable automatically introduces
          [1039]$_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS if [1040]$LDMODULEVERSION is set.
          Othervise it evaluates to an empty string.

   __SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          This construction variable automatically introduces
          [1041]$_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS if [1042]$SHLIBVERSION is set.
          Othervise it evaluates to an empty string.

   _APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the
          linker flags to specify apple's linker's -compatibility_version
          flag. The default generator uses
          [1043]$APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and
          [1044]$APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and
          [1045]$SHLIBVERSION to determine the correct flag.

   APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag:
          -compatibility_version

          The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and
          65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and 255, Z can be omitted
          or between 1 and 255. This value will be derived from
          [1046]$SHLIBVERSION if not specified. The lowest digit will be
          dropped and replaced by a 0.

          If the [1047]$APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION is set then no
          -compatibility_version will be output.

          See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

   _APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION
          A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the
          linker flags to specify apple's linker's -current_version flag.
          The default generator uses [1048]$APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION and
          [1049]$APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION and [1050]$SHLIBVERSION to
          determine the correct flag.

   APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION
          On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag:
          -current_version

          The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and
          65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and 255, Z can be omitted
          or between 1 and 255. This value will be set to
          [1051]$SHLIBVERSION if not specified.

          If the [1052]$APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION is set then no
          -current_version will be output.

          See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

   APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION
          Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable
          adding -compatibility_version flag when generating versioned
          shared libraries.

          This overrides [1053]$APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION.

   APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION
          Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable
          adding -current_version flag when generating versioned shared
          libraries.

          This overrides [1054]$APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION.

   AR
          The static library archiver.

   ARCHITECTURE
          Specifies the system architecture for which the package is being
          built. The default is the system architecture of the machine on
          which SCons is running. This is used to fill in the
          Architecture: field in an Ipkg control file, and the BuildArch:
          field in the RPM .spec file, as well as forming part of the name
          of a generated RPM package file.

   ARCOM
          The command line used to generate a static library from object
          files.

   ARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file. If this is not set, then
          [1055]$ARCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   ARFLAGS
          General options passed to the static library archiver.

   AS
          The assembler.

   ASCOM
          The command line used to generate an object file from an
          assembly-language source file.

   ASCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file. If this is not set, then
          [1056]$ASCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

   ASFLAGS
          General options passed to the assembler.

   ASPPCOM
          The command line used to assemble an assembly-language source
          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1057]$ASFLAGS
          and [1058]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line.

   ASPPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when an object file is generated from an
          assembly-language source file after first running the file
          through the C preprocessor. If this is not set, then
          [1059]$ASPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASPPCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

   ASPPFLAGS
          General options when an assembling an assembly-language source
          file into an object file after first running the file through
          the C preprocessor. The default is to use the value of
          [1060]$ASFLAGS.

   BIBTEX
          The bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter
          and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   BIBTEXCOM
          The command line used to call the bibliography generator for the
          TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter.

   BIBTEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a bibliography for TeX or
          LaTeX. If this is not set, then [1061]$BIBTEXCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(BIBTEXCOMSTR = "Generating bibliography $TARGET")

   BIBTEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the bibliography generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   BUILDERS
          A dictionary mapping the names of the builders available through
          this environment to underlying Builder objects. Builders named
          Alias, CFile, CXXFile, DVI, Library, Object, PDF, PostScript,
          and Program are available by default. If you initialize this
          variable when an Environment is created:

env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'NewBuilder' : foo})

          the default Builders will no longer be available. To use a new
          Builder object in addition to the default Builders, add your new
          Builder object like this:

env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'NewBuilder' : foo})

          or this:

env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS']['NewBuilder'] = foo

   CC
          The C compiler.

   CCCOM
          The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static)
          object file. Any options specified in the [1062]$CFLAGS,
          [1063]$CCFLAGS and [1064]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are
          included on this command line.

   CCCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a C source file is compiled to a
          (static) object file. If this is not set, then [1065]$CCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CCFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C and C++ compilers.

   CCPCHFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support building
          with precompiled headers. The default value expands expands to
          the appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options when
          the [1066]$PCH construction variable is set.

   CCPDBFLAGS
          Options added to the compiler command line to support storing
          debugging information in a Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file. The
          default value expands expands to appropriate Microsoft Visual
          C++ command-line options when the [1067]$PDB construction
          variable is set.

          The Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by default to
          generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with
          parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in
          the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single
          PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only
          way to get debug information embedded into a static library.
          Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance,
          although parallel builds will no longer work.

          You can generate PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the
          default [1068]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = ['${(PDB and "/Zi /Fd%s" % File(PDB)) or ""}']

          An alternative would be to use the /Zi to put the debugging
          information in a separate .pdb file for each object file by
          overriding the [1069]$CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = '/Zi /Fd${TARGET}.pdb'

   CCVERSION
          The version number of the C compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C compiler being used.

   CFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C source files. This is used by the internal
          CFile builder when generating C files from Lex (.l) or YACC (.y)
          input files. The default suffix, of course, is .c (lower case).
          On case-insensitive systems (like Windows), SCons also treats .C
          (upper case) files as C files.

   CFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C compiler (C only; not
          C++).

   CHANGE_SPECFILE
          A hook for modifying the file that controls the packaging build
          (the .spec for RPM, the control for Ipkg, the .wxs for MSI). If
          set, the function will be called after the SCons template for
          the file has been written.

   CHANGED_SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   CHANGED_TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   CHANGELOG
          The name of a file containing the change log text to be included
          in the package. This is included as the %changelog section of
          the RPM .spec file.

   _concat
          A function used to produce variables like $_CPPINCFLAGS. It
          takes four or five arguments: a prefix to concatenate onto each
          element, a list of elements, a suffix to concatenate onto each
          element, an environment for variable interpolation, and an
          optional function that will be called to transform the list
          before concatenation.

env['_CPPINCFLAGS'] = '$( ${_concat(INCPREFIX, CPPPATH, INCSUFFIX, __env__, RDir
s)} $)',

   CONFIGUREDIR
          The name of the directory in which Configure context test files
          are written. The default is .sconf_temp in the top-level
          directory containing the SConstruct file.

   CONFIGURELOG
          The name of the Configure context log file. The default is
          config.log in the top-level directory containing the SConstruct
          file.

   _CPPDEFFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options to define values. The value
          of $_CPPDEFFLAGS is created by respectively prepending and
          appending $CPPDEFPREFIX and $CPPDEFSUFFIX to the beginning and
          end of each definition in $CPPDEFINES.

   CPPDEFINES
          A platform independent specification of C preprocessor
          definitions. The definitions will be added to command lines
          through the automatically-generated $_CPPDEFFLAGS construction
          variable (see above), which is constructed according to the type
          of value of $CPPDEFINES:

          If $CPPDEFINES is a string, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be respectively
          prepended and appended to the beginning and end of each
          definition in $CPPDEFINES.

# Will add -Dxyz to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /Dxyz to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES='xyz')

          If $CPPDEFINES is a list, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and
          $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be respectively
          prepended and appended to the beginning and end of each element
          in the list. If any element is a list or tuple, then the first
          item is the name being defined and the second item is its value:

# Will add -DB=2 -DA to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DB=2 /DA to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('B', 2), 'A'])

          If $CPPDEFINES is a dictionary, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX
          and $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables will be respectively
          prepended and appended to the beginning and end of each item
          from the dictionary. The key of each dictionary item is a name
          being defined to the dictionary item's corresponding value; if
          the value is None, then the name is defined without an explicit
          value. Note that the resulting flags are sorted by keyword to
          ensure that the order of the options on the command line is
          consistent each time scons is run.

# Will add -DA -DB=2 to POSIX compiler command lines,
# and /DA /DB=2 to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES={'B':2, 'A':None})

   CPPDEFPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify preprocessor definitions on the C
          compiler command line. This will be prepended to the beginning
          of each definition in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable when
          the $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPDEFSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify preprocessor definitions on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          definition in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable when the
          $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   CPPFLAGS
          User-specified C preprocessor options. These will be included in
          any command that uses the C preprocessor, including not just
          compilation of C and C++ source files via the [1070]$CCCOM,
          [1071]$SHCCCOM, [1072]$CXXCOM and [1073]$SHCXXCOM command lines,
          but also the [1074]$FORTRANPPCOM, [1075]$SHFORTRANPPCOM,
          [1076]$F77PPCOM and [1077]$SHF77PPCOM command lines used to
          compile a Fortran source file, and the [1078]$ASPPCOM command
          line used to assemble an assembly language source file, after
          first running each file through the C preprocessor. Note that
          this variable does not contain -I (or similar) include search
          path options that scons generates automatically from
          [1079]$CPPPATH. See [1080]$_CPPINCFLAGS, below, for the variable
          that expands to those options.

   _CPPINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          C preprocessor command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files. The value of $_CPPINCFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending $INCPREFIX and
          $INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $CPPPATH.

   CPPPATH
          The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for
          include directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in CCFLAGS or CXXFLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          CPPPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory
          when they are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a
          directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(CPPPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(CPPPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_CPPINCFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending
          the value of the $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX construction
          variables to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $CPPPATH. Any command lines you define that need the CPPPATH
          directory list should include $_CPPINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(CCCOM="my_compiler $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   CPPSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for C
          preprocessor implicit dependencies (#include lines). The default
          list is:

[".c", ".C", ".cxx", ".cpp", ".c++", ".cc",
 ".h", ".H", ".hxx", ".hpp", ".hh",
 ".F", ".fpp", ".FPP",
 ".m", ".mm",
 ".S", ".spp", ".SPP"]

   CXX
          The C++ compiler.

   CXXCOM
          The command line used to compile a C++ source file to an object
          file. Any options specified in the [1081]$CXXFLAGS and
          [1082]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line.

   CXXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a C++ source file is compiled to a
          (static) object file. If this is not set, then [1083]$CXXCOM
          (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(CXXCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

   CXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix for C++ source files. This is used by the internal
          CXXFile builder when generating C++ files from Lex (.ll) or YACC
          (.yy) input files. The default suffix is .cc. SCons also treats
          files with the suffixes .cpp, .cxx, .c++, and .C++ as C++ files,
          and files with .mm suffixes as Objective C++ files. On
          case-sensitive systems (Linux, UNIX, and other POSIX-alikes),
          SCons also treats .C (upper case) files as C++ files.

   CXXFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the C++ compiler. By default,
          this includes the value of [1084]$CCFLAGS, so that setting
          $CCFLAGS affects both C and C++ compilation. If you want to add
          C++-specific flags, you must set or override the value of
          [1085]$CXXFLAGS.

   CXXVERSION
          The version number of the C++ compiler. This may or may not be
          set, depending on the specific C++ compiler being used.

   DC
          The D compiler to use.

   DCOM
          The command line used to compile a D file to an object file. Any
          options specified in the [1086]$DFLAGS construction variable is
          included on this command line.

   DDEBUG
          List of debug tags to enable when compiling.

   DDEBUGPREFIX
          DDEBUGPREFIX.

   DDEBUGSUFFIX
          DDEBUGSUFFIX.

   DESCRIPTION
          A long description of the project being packaged. This is
          included in the relevant section of the file that controls the
          packaging build.

   DESCRIPTION_lang
          A language-specific long description for the specified lang.
          This is used to populate a %description -l section of an RPM
          .spec file.

   DFILESUFFIX
          DFILESUFFIX.

   DFLAGPREFIX

          DFLAGSUFFIX.

   DINCPREFIX
          DINCPREFIX.

   DINCSUFFIX

          to the target being built.

          A function that converts a string into a Dir instance relative
          to the target being built.

   Dirs
          A function that converts a list of strings into a list of Dir
          instances relative to the target being built.

   DLIB
          Name of the lib tool to use for D codes.

   ENV
          A dictionary of environment variables to use when invoking
          commands. When $ENV is used in a command all list values will be
          joined using the path separator and any other non-string values
          will simply be coerced to a string. Note that, by default, scons
          does not propagate the environment in force when you execute
          scons to the commands used to build target files. This is so
          that builds will be guaranteed repeatable regardless of the
          environment variables set at the time scons is invoked.

          If you want to propagate your environment variables to the
          commands executed to build target files, you must do so
          explicitly:

import os
env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)

          Note that you can choose only to propagate certain environment
          variables. A common example is the system PATH environment
          variable, so that scons uses the same utilities as the invoking
          shell (or other process):

import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})

   ESCAPE
          A function that will be called to escape shell special
          characters in command lines. The function should take one
          argument: the command line string to escape; and should return
          the escaped command line.

   F03
          The Fortran 03 compiler. You should normally set the
          [1096]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [1097]$F03 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 03 files.

   F03COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 03 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1098]$F03COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 03 files. You should
          normally set the [1099]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F03COMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 03 source file is compiled
          to an object file. If this is not set, then [1100]$F03COM or
          [1101]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F03FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F03 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f03']

   F03FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 03
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [1102]$F03PATH. See [1103]$_F03INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1104]$F03FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 03 files. You should normally set the
          [1105]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F03INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 03 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [1106]$_F03INCFLAGS is created by appending [1107]$INCPREFIX and
          [1108]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1109]$F03PATH.

   F03PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 03 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1110]$F03FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1111]$F03PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use
          #: You only need to set [1112]$F03PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 03 files. You should normally
          set the [1113]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F03PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F03PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1114]$_F03INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [1115]$INCPREFIX and [1116]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [1117]$F03PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F03PATH directory list
          should include [1118]$_F03INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F03COM="my_compiler $_F03INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F03PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 03 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1119]$F03FLAGS and
          [1120]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [1121]$F03PPCOM if you need
          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 03
          files. You should normally set the [1122]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,
          which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F03PPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 03 source file is compiled
          to an object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [1123]$F03PPCOM or
          [1124]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F03PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F03 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty

          The Fortran 08 compiler. You should normally set the
          [1125]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [1126]$F08 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 08 files.

   F08COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 08 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1127]$F08COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 08 files. You should
          normally set the [1128]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F08COMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 08 source file is compiled
          to an object file. If this is not set, then [1129]$F08COM or

          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [1131]$F08PATH. See [1132]$_F08INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1133]$F08FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 08 files. You should normally set the
          [1134]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F08INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 08 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [1135]$_F08INCFLAGS is created by appending [1136]$INCPREFIX and
          [1137]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1138]$F08PATH.

   F08PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 08 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1139]$F08FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1140]$F08PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use
          #: You only need to set [1141]$F08PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 08 files. You should normally
          set the [1142]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F08PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')

          [1149]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [1150]$F08PPCOM if you need
          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 08
          files. You should normally set the [1151]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,

          Fortran versions.

   F77PPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 77 source file is compiled
          to an object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [1181]$F77PPCOM or
          [1182]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F77PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F77 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty

   F90
          The Fortran 90 compiler. You should normally set the
          [1183]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [1184]$F90 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 90 files.

   F90COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 90 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1185]$F90COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 90 files. You should
          normally set the [1186]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F90COMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 90 source file is compiled
          to an object file. If this is not set, then [1187]$F90COM or
          [1188]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F90FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F90 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f90']

   F90FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 90
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [1189]$F90PATH. See [1190]$_F90INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1191]$F90FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 90 files. You should normally set the
          [1192]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F90INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 90 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [1193]$_F90INCFLAGS is created by appending [1194]$INCPREFIX and
          [1195]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1196]$F90PATH.

   F90PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 90 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1197]$F90FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1198]$F90PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use
          #: You only need to set [1199]$F90PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 90 files. You should normally
          set the [1200]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F90PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F90PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1201]$_F90INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [1202]$INCPREFIX and [1203]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [1204]$F90PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F90PATH directory list
          should include [1205]$_F90INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F90COM="my_compiler $_F90INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F90PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 90 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1206]$F90FLAGS and
          [1207]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [1208]$F90PPCOM if you need
          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 90
          files. You should normally set the [1209]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,
          which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F90PPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 90 source file is compiled
          after first running the file through the C preprocessor. If this
          is not set, then [1210]$F90PPCOM or [1211]$FORTRANPPCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   F90PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F90 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty

   F95
          The Fortran 95 compiler. You should normally set the
          [1212]$FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran
          compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set
          [1213]$F95 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler
          version for Fortran 95 files.

   F95COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 95 source file to an
          object file. You only need to set [1214]$F95COM if you need to
          use a specific command line for Fortran 95 files. You should
          normally set the [1215]$FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the
          default command line for all Fortran versions.

   F95COMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is compiled
          to an object file. If this is not set, then [1216]$F95COM or
          [1217]$FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F95FILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the F95 dialect will be
          used. By default, this is ['.f95']

   F95FLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 95
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include search path options that scons generates
          automatically from [1218]$F95PATH. See [1219]$_F95INCFLAGS
          below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only
          need to set [1220]$F95FLAGS if you need to define specific user
          options for Fortran 95 files. You should normally set the
          [1221]$FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified
          options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions.

   _F95INCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran 95 compiler command-line options for specifying
          directories to be searched for include files. The value of
          [1222]$_F95INCFLAGS is created by appending [1223]$INCPREFIX and
          [1224]$INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          [1225]$F95PATH.

   F95PATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran 95 compiler will search
          for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
          include directory arguments in [1226]$F95FLAGS because the
          result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          [1227]$F95PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
          directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to
          look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use
          #: You only need to set [1228]$F95PATH if you need to define a
          specific include path for Fortran 95 files. You should normally
          set the [1229]$FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include
          path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F95PATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F95PATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1230]$_F95INCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the
          [1231]$INCPREFIX and [1232]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to
          the beginning and end of each directory in [1233]$F95PATH. Any
          command lines you define that need the F95PATH directory list
          should include [1234]$_F95INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F95COM="my_compiler $_F95INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

   F95PPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 95 source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. Any options specified in the [1235]$F95FLAGS and
          [1236]$CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this
          command line. You only need to set [1237]$F95PPCOM if you need
          to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 95
          files. You should normally set the [1238]$FORTRANPPCOM variable,
          which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all
          Fortran versions.

   F95PPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is compiled
          to an object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [1239]$F95PPCOM or
          [1240]$FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   F95PPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for F95 dialect will be used. By default, this
          is empty

          to the target being built.

          A function that converts a string into a File instance relative
          to the target being built.

   FORTRAN
          The default Fortran compiler for all versions of Fortran.

   FORTRANCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file. By default, any options specified in the
          [1241]$FORTRANFLAGS, [1242]$CPPFLAGS, [1243]$_CPPDEFFLAGS,
          [1244]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and [1245]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variables are included on this command line.

   FORTRANCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran source file is compiled to
          an object file. If this is not set, then [1246]$FORTRANCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the FORTRAN dialect will
          be used. By default, this is ['.f', '.for', '.ftn']

   FORTRANFLAGS
          General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran
          compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or
          similar) include or module search path options that scons
          generates automatically from [1247]$FORTRANPATH. See
          [1248]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS and [1249]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, below, for
          the variables that expand those options.

   _FORTRANINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line options for specifying directories
          to be searched for include files and module files. The value of
          [1250]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS is created by respectively prepending
          and appending [1251]$INCPREFIX and [1252]$INCSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each directory in [1253]$FORTRANPATH.

   FORTRANMODDIR
          Directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files it generates. This variable is empty, by default.
          Some Fortran compilers will internally append this directory in
          the search path for module files, as well.

   FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be prepended to the beginning
          of the directory in the [1254]$FORTRANMODDIR construction
          variables when the [1255]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is
          automatically generated.

   FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of the
          directory in the [1256]$FORTRANMODDIR construction variables
          when the [1257]$_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is automatically
          generated.

   _FORTRANMODFLAG
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          Fortran compiler command-line option for specifying the
          directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any
          module files that happen to get generated during compilation.
          The value of [1258]$_FORTRANMODFLAG is created by respectively
          prepending and appending [1259]$FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX and
          [1260]$FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and end of the
          directory in [1261]$FORTRANMODDIR.

   FORTRANMODPREFIX
          The module file prefix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is left empty, by default. For situations
          in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal
          convention, the user may use this variable. Its value will be
          appended to every module file name as scons attempts to resolve
          dependencies.

   FORTRANMODSUFFIX
          The module file suffix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons
          assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard
          naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a
          result, this variable is set to ".mod", by default. For
          situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the
          normal convention, the user may use this variable. Its value
          will be appended to every module file name as scons attempts to
          resolve dependencies.

   FORTRANPATH
          The list of directories that the Fortran compiler will search
          for include files and (for some compilers) module files. The
          Fortran implicit dependency scanner will search these
          directories for include files (but not module files since they
          are autogenerated and, as such, may not actually exist at the
          time the scan takes place). Don't explicitly put include
          directory arguments in FORTRANFLAGS because the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. Note: directory names in FORTRANPATH will be
          looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are
          used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(FORTRANPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(FORTRANPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated [1262]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and
          appending the values of the [1263]$INCPREFIX and
          [1264]$INCSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end
          of each directory in [1265]$FORTRANPATH. Any command lines you
          define that need the FORTRANPATH directory list should include
          [1266]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(FORTRANCOM="my_compiler $_FORTRANINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURC
E")

   FORTRANPPCOM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an
          object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. By default, any options specified in the
          [1267]$FORTRANFLAGS, [1268]$CPPFLAGS, [1269]$_CPPDEFFLAGS,
          [1270]$_FORTRANMODFLAG, and [1271]$_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction
          variables are included on this command line.

   FORTRANPPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran source file is compiled to
          an object file after first running the file through the C
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [1272]$FORTRANPPCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

   FORTRANPPFILESUFFIXES
          The list of file extensions for which the compilation +
          preprocessor pass for FORTRAN dialect will be used. By default,
          this is ['.fpp', '.FPP']

   FORTRANSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for Fortran
          implicit dependencies (INCLUDE lines and USE statements). The
          default list is:

[".f", ".F", ".for", ".FOR", ".ftn", ".FTN", ".fpp", ".FPP",
".f77", ".F77", ".f90", ".F90", ".f95", ".F95"]

   FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list containing the paths to search for
          frameworks. Used by the compiler to find framework-style
          includes like #include <Fmwk/Header.h>. Used by the linker to
          find user-specified frameworks when linking (see
          [1273]$FRAMEWORKS). For example:

                env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKPATH='#myframeworkdir')

          will add

                ... -Fmyframeworkdir

          to the compiler and linker command lines.

   _FRAMEWORKPATH
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options
          corresponding to [1274]$FRAMEWORKPATH.

   FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for the
          FRAMEWORKPATH entries. (see [1275]$FRAMEWORKPATH). The default
          value is -F.

   FRAMEWORKPREFIX
          On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for linking in
          frameworks (see [1276]$FRAMEWORKS). The default value is
          -framework.

   _FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction
          variable containing the linker command-line options for linking
          with FRAMEWORKS.

   FRAMEWORKS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, a list of the framework names to be linked
          into a program or shared library or bundle. The default value is
          the empty list. For example:

                env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKS=Split('System Cocoa SystemConfigurat
ion'))

   FRAMEWORKSFLAGS
          On Mac OS X with gcc, general user-supplied frameworks options
          to be added at the end of a command line building a loadable
          module. (This has been largely superseded by the
          [1277]$FRAMEWORKPATH, [1278]$FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX,
          [1279]$FRAMEWORKPREFIX and [1280]$FRAMEWORKS variables described
          above.)

   GS
          The Ghostscript program used, e.g. to convert PostScript to PDF
          files.

   GSCOM
          The full Ghostscript command line used for the conversion
          process. Its default value is "$GS $GSFLAGS -sOutputFile=$TARGET
          $SOURCES".

   GSCOMSTR
          The string displayed when Ghostscript is called for the
          conversion process. If this is not set (the default), then
          [1281]$GSCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   GSFLAGS
          General options passed to the Ghostscript program, when
          converting PostScript to PDF files for example. Its default
          value is "-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite"

   HOST_ARCH
          The name of the host hardware architecture used to create the
          Environment. If a platform is specified when creating the
          Environment, then that Platform's logic will handle setting this
          value. This value is immutable, and should not be changed by the
          user after the Environment is initialized. Currently only set
          for Win32.

          Sets the host architecture for Visual Studio compiler. If not
          set, default to the detected host architecture: note that this
          may depend on the python you are using. This variable must be
          passed as an argument to the Environment() constructor; setting
          it later has no effect.

          Valid values are the same as for $TARGET_ARCH.

          This is currently only used on Windows, but in the future it
          will be used on other OSes as well.

   HOST_OS
          The name of the host operating system used to create the
          Environment. If a platform is specified when creating the
          Environment, then that Platform's logic will handle setting this
          value. This value is immutable, and should not be changed by the
          user after the Environment is initialized. Currently only set
          for Win32.

   IDLSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for IDL
          implicit dependencies (#include or import lines). The default
          list is:

[".idl", ".IDL"]

   IMPLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          Used to override
          [1282]$SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS/[1283]$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          when creating versioned import library for a shared
          library/loadable module. If not defined, then
          [1284]$SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS/[1285]$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          is used to determine whether to disable symlink generation or
          not.

   IMPLIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for import library names. For example, cygwin
          uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in pair with dynamic
          libraries (cygfoo.dll). The [1286]cyglink linker sets
          [1287]$IMPLIBPREFIX to 'lib' and [1288]$SHLIBPREFIX to 'cyg'.

   IMPLIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for import library names. For example, cygwin
          uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in pair with dynamic
          libraries (cygfoo.dll). The [1289]cyglink linker sets
          [1290]$IMPLIBSUFFIX to '.dll.a' and [1291]$SHLIBSUFFIX to
          '.dll'.

   IMPLIBVERSION
          Used to override [1292]$SHLIBVERSION/[1293]$LDMODULEVERSION when
          generating versioned import library for a shared
          library/loadable module. If undefined, the
          [1294]$SHLIBVERSION/[1295]$LDMODULEVERSION is used to determine
          the version of versioned import library.

   IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES
          Controls whether or not SCons will add implicit dependencies for
          the commands executed to build targets.

          By default, SCons will add to each target an implicit dependency
          on the command represented by the first argument on any command
          line it executes. The specific file for the dependency is found
          by searching the PATH variable in the ENV environment used to
          execute the command.

          If the construction variable $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is
          set to a false value (None, False, 0, etc.), then the implicit
          dependency will not be added to the targets built with that
          construction environment.

env = Environment(IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES = 0)

   INCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be prepended to the beginning
          of each directory in the $CPPPATH and $FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the $_CPPINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables
          are automatically generated.

   INCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the C
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          directory in the $CPPPATH and $FORTRANPATH construction
          variables when the $_CPPINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables
          are automatically generated.

   INSTALL
          A function to be called to install a file into a destination
          file name. The default function copies the file into the
          destination (and sets the destination file's mode and permission
          bits to match the source file's). The function takes the
          following arguments:

def install(dest, source, env):

          dest is the path name of the destination file. source is the
          path name of the source file. env is the construction
          environment (a dictionary of construction values) in force for
          this file installation.

   INSTALLSTR
          The string displayed when a file is installed into a destination
          file name. The default is:

Install file: "$SOURCE" as "$TARGET"

   INTEL_C_COMPILER_VERSION
          Set by the "intelc" Tool to the major version number of the
          Intel C compiler selected for use.

   JAR
          The Java archive tool.

          The Java archive tool.

   JARCHDIR
          The directory to which the Java archive tool should change
          (using the -C option).

          The directory to which the Java archive tool should change
          (using the -C option).

   JARCOM
          The command line used to call the Java archive tool.

          The command line used to call the Java archive tool.

   JARCOMSTR
          The string displayed when the Java archive tool is called If
          this is not set, then $JARCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JARCOMSTR = "JARchiving $SOURCES into $TARGET")

          The string displayed when the Java archive tool is called If
          this is not set, then [1296]$JARCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

env = Environment(JARCOMSTR = "JARchiving $SOURCES into $TARGET")

   JARFLAGS
          General options passed to the Java archive tool. By default this
          is set to cf to create the necessary jar file.

          General options passed to the Java archive tool. By default this
          is set to cf to create the necessary jar file.

   JARSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java archives: .jar by default.

          The suffix for Java archives: .jar by default.

   JAVABOOTCLASSPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be added to the
          javac command line via the -bootclasspath option. The individual
          directory names will be separated by the operating system's path
          separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on Windows).

   JAVAC
          The Java compiler.

   JAVACCOM
          The command line used to compile a directory tree containing
          Java source files to corresponding Java class files. Any options
          specified in the [1297]$JAVACFLAGS construction variable are
          included on this command line.

   JAVACCOMSTR
          The string displayed when compiling a directory tree of Java
          source files to corresponding Java class files. If this is not
          set, then [1298]$JAVACCOM (the command line) is displayed.

                env = Environment(JAVACCOMSTR = "Compiling class files $TARGETS
from $SOURCES")

   JAVACFLAGS
          General options that are passed to the Java compiler.

   JAVACLASSDIR
          The directory in which Java class files may be found. This is
          stripped from the beginning of any Java .class file names
          supplied to the JavaH builder.

   JAVACLASSPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for Java
          .class file. The directories in this list will be added to the
          javac and javah command lines via the -classpath option. The
          individual directory names will be separated by the operating
          system's path separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on
          Windows).

          Note that this currently just adds the specified directory via
          the -classpath option. SCons does not currently search the
          $JAVACLASSPATH directories for dependency .class files.

   JAVACLASSSUFFIX
          The suffix for Java class files; .class by default.

   JAVAH
          The Java generator for C header and stub files.

   JAVAHCOM
          The command line used to generate C header and stub files from
          Java classes. Any options specified in the [1299]$JAVAHFLAGS
          construction variable are included on this command line.

   JAVAHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when C header and stub files are generated
          from Java classes. If this is not set, then [1300]$JAVAHCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVAHCOMSTR = "Generating header/stub file(s) $TARGETS from $S
OURCES")

   JAVAHFLAGS
          General options passed to the C header and stub file generator
          for Java classes.

   JAVAINCLUDES
          Include path for Java header files (such as jni.h)

   JAVASOURCEPATH
          Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for
          input .java file. The directories in this list will be added to
          the javac command line via the -sourcepath option. The
          individual directory names will be separated by the operating
          system's path separate character (: on UNIX/Linux/POSIX, ; on
          Windows).

          Note that this currently just adds the specified directory via
          the -sourcepath option. SCons does not currently search the
          $JAVASOURCEPATH directories for dependency .java files.

   JAVASUFFIX
          The suffix for Java files; .java by default.

   JAVAVERSION
          Specifies the Java version being used by the Java builder. This
          is not currently used to select one version of the Java compiler
          vs. another. Instead, you should set this to specify the version
          of Java supported by your javac compiler. The default is 1.4.

          This is sometimes necessary because Java 1.5 changed the file
          names that are created for nested anonymous inner classes, which
          can cause a mismatch with the files that SCons expects will be
          generated by the javac compiler. Setting $JAVAVERSION to 1.5 (or
          1.6, as appropriate) can make SCons realize that a Java 1.5 or
          1.6 build is actually up to date.

   LATEX
          The LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   LATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the LaTeX structured formatter
          and typesetter. If this is not set, then [1301]$LATEXCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LATEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES")

   LATEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   LATEXRETRIES
          The maximum number of times that LaTeX will be re-run if the
          .log generated by the [1302]$LATEXCOM command indicates that
          there are undefined references. The default is to try to resolve
          undefined references by re-running LaTeX up to three times.

   LATEXSUFFIXES
          The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for LaTeX
          implicit dependencies (\include or \import files). The default
          list is:

[".tex", ".ltx", ".latex"]

   LDMODULE
          The linker for building loadable modules. By default, this is
          the same as [1303]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOM
          The command line for building loadable modules. On Mac OS X,
          this uses the [1304]$LDMODULE, [1305]$LDMODULEFLAGS and
          [1306]$FRAMEWORKSFLAGS variables. On other systems, this is the
          same as [1307]$SHLINK.

   LDMODULECOMSTR
          The string displayed when building loadable modules. If this is
          not set, then [1308]$LDMODULECOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   LDMODULEEMITTER
          Contains the emitter specification for the [1309]LoadableModule
          builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general
          information on specifying emitters.

   LDMODULEFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker for building loadable
          modules.

   LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS
          Instructs the [1310]LoadableModule builder to not automatically
          create symlinks for versioned modules. Defaults to
          $SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS

   LDMODULEPREFIX
          The prefix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          [1311]$SHLIBPREFIX.

   _LDMODULESONAME
          A macro that automatically generates loadable module's SONAME
          based on $TARGET, $LDMODULEVERSION and $LDMODULESUFFIX. Used by
          [1312]LoadableModule builder when the linker tool supports
          SONAME (e.g. [1313]gnulink).

   LDMODULESUFFIX
          The suffix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X,
          this is null; on other systems, this is the same as
          $SHLIBSUFFIX.

   LDMODULEVERSION
          When this construction variable is defined, a versioned loadable
          module is created by [1314]LoadableModule builder. This
          activates the [1315]$_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS and thus modifies the
          [1316]$LDMODULECOM as required, adds the version number to the
          library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed.
          [1317]$LDMODULEVERSION versions should exist in the same format
          as [1318]$SHLIBVERSION.

   LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          Extra flags added to [1319]$LDMODULECOM when building versioned
          [1320]LoadableModule. These flags are only used when
          [1321]$LDMODULEVERSION is set.

   _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS
          This macro automatically introduces extra flags to
          [1322]$LDMODULECOM when building versioned [1323]LoadableModule
          (that is when [1324]$LDMODULEVERSION is set).
          _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS usually adds [1325]$SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and
          some extra dynamically generated options (such as
          -Wl,-soname=$_LDMODULESONAME). It is unused by plain
          (unversioned) loadable modules.

   LEX
          The lexical analyzer generator.

   LEXCOM
          The command line used to call the lexical analyzer generator to
          generate a source file.

   LEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          lexical analyzer generator. If this is not set, then
          [1326]$LEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LEXCOMSTR = "Lex'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   LEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the lexical analyzer generator.

   LEXUNISTD
          Used only on windows environments to set a lex flag to prevent
          'unistd.h' from being included. The default value is
          '--nounistd'.

   _LIBDIRFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for library. The value of $_LIBDIRFLAGS is created by
          respectively prepending and appending $LIBDIRPREFIX and
          $LIBDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $LIBPATH.

   LIBDIRPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be prepended to the beginning of each
          directory in the $LIBPATH construction variable when the
          $_LIBDIRFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   LIBDIRSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library directory on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each directory
          in the $LIBPATH construction variable when the $_LIBDIRFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBEMITTER
          Contains the emitter specification for the [1327]StaticLibrary
          builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general
          information on specifying emitters.

   _LIBFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          linker command-line options for specifying libraries to be
          linked with the resulting target. The value of $_LIBFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending $LIBLINKPREFIX
          and $LIBLINKSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each filename in
          $LIBS.

   LIBLINKPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be prepended to the beginning of each
          library in the $LIBS construction variable when the $_LIBFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   LIBLINKSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a library to link on the linker
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each library
          in the $LIBS construction variable when the $_LIBFLAGS variable
          is automatically generated.

   LIBPATH
          The list of directories that will be searched for libraries. The
          implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for
          include files. Don't explicitly put include directory arguments
          in $LINKFLAGS or $SHLINKFLAGS because the result will be
          non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the
          dependency scanner. Note: directory names in LIBPATH will be
          looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are
          used in a command. To force scons to look-up a directory
          relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(LIBPATH='#/libs')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

libs = Dir('libs')
env = Environment(LIBPATH=libs)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_LIBDIRFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending
          the values of the $LIBDIRPREFIX and $LIBDIRSUFFIX construction
          variables to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $LIBPATH. Any command lines you define that need the LIBPATH
          directory list should include $_LIBDIRFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

   LIBPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBPREFIXES
          A list of all legal prefixes for library file names. When
          searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files
          with these prefixes, the base library name, and suffixes in the
          $LIBSUFFIXES list.

   LIBS
          A list of one or more libraries that will be linked with any
          executable programs created by this environment.

          The library list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_LIBFLAGS construction variable, which
          is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the
          values of the $LIBLINKPREFIX and $LIBLINKSUFFIX construction
          variables to the beginning and end of each filename in $LIBS.
          Any command lines you define that need the LIBS library list
          should include $_LIBFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE
")

          If you add a File object to the $LIBS list, the name of that
          file will be added to $_LIBFLAGS, and thus the link line, as is,
          without $LIBLINKPREFIX or $LIBLINKSUFFIX. For example:

env.Append(LIBS=File('/tmp/mylib.so'))

          In all cases, scons will add dependencies from the executable
          program to all the libraries in this list.

   LIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) library file names. A default value
          is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the
          value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar,
          sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they
          create.

   LIBSUFFIXES
          A list of all legal suffixes for library file names. When
          searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files
          with prefixes, in the $LIBPREFIXES list, the base library name,
          and these suffixes.

   LICENSE
          The abbreviated name, preferably the SPDX code, of the license
          under which this project is released (GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1,
          BSD-2-Clause etc.). See
          http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical for a list of
          license names and SPDX codes.

   LINESEPARATOR
          The separator used by the Substfile and Textfile builders. This
          value is used between sources when constructing the target. It
          defaults to the current system line separator.

   LINGUAS_FILE
          The $LINGUAS_FILE defines file(s) containing list of additional
          linguas to be processed by [1328]POInit, [1329]POUpdate or
          [1330]MOFiles builders. It also affects [1331]Translate builder.
          If the variable contains a string, it defines name of the list
          file. The $LINGUAS_FILE may be a list of file names as well. If
          $LINGUAS_FILE is set to True (or non-zero numeric value), the
          list will be read from default file named LINGUAS.

   LINK
          The linker.

   LINKCOM
          The command line used to link object files into an executable.

   LINKCOMSTR
          The string displayed when object files are linked into an
          executable. If this is not set, then [1332]$LINKCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LINKCOMSTR = "Linking $TARGET")

   LINKFLAGS
          General user options passed to the linker. Note that this
          variable should not contain -l (or similar) options for linking
          with the libraries listed in [1333]$LIBS, nor -L (or similar)
          library search path options that scons generates automatically
          from [1334]$LIBPATH. See [1335]$_LIBFLAGS above, for the
          variable that expands to library-link options, and
          [1336]$_LIBDIRFLAGS above, for the variable that expands to
          library search path options.

   M4
          The M4 macro preprocessor.

   M4COM
          The command line used to pass files through the M4 macro
          preprocessor.

   M4COMSTR
          The string displayed when a file is passed through the M4 macro
          preprocessor. If this is not set, then [1337]$M4COM (the command
          line) is displayed.

   M4FLAGS
          General options passed to the M4 macro preprocessor.

   MAKEINDEX
          The makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and
          the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

   MAKEINDEXCOM

          [1338]$MAKEINDEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

   MAKEINDEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the makeindex generator for the TeX
          formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
          typesetter.

   MAXLINELENGTH
          The maximum number of characters allowed on an external command
          line. On Win32 systems, link lines longer than this many
          characters are linked via a temporary file name.

   MSSDK_DIR
          The directory containing the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK
          or Windows SDK) to be used for compilation.

   MSSDK_VERSION
          The version string of the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK or
          Windows SDK) to be used for compilation. Supported versions
          include 6.1, 6.0A, 6.0, 2003R2 and 2003R1.

   MSVC_BATCH
          When set to any true value, specifies that SCons should batch
          compilation of object files when calling the Microsoft Visual
          C/C++ compiler. All compilations of source files from the same
          source directory that generate target files in a same output
          directory and were configured in SCons using the same
          construction environment will be built in a single call to the
          compiler. Only source files that have changed since their object
          files were built will be passed to each compiler invocation (via
          the [1371]$CHANGED_SOURCES construction variable). Any
          compilations where the object (target) file base name (minus the
          .obj) does not match the source file base name will be compiled
          separately.

   MSVC_USE_SCRIPT
          Use a batch script to set up Microsoft Visual Studio compiler

          $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT overrides $MSVC_VERSION and $TARGET_ARCH. If
          set to the name of a Visual Studio .bat file (e.g. vcvars.bat),
          SCons will run that bat file and extract the relevant variables
          from the result (typically %INCLUDE%, %LIB%, and %PATH%).
          Setting MSVC_USE_SCRIPT to None bypasses the Visual Studio
          autodetection entirely; use this if you are running SCons in a
          Visual Studio cmd window and importing the shell's environment
          variables.

   MSVC_UWP_APP
          Build libraries for a Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
          Application.

          If $MSVC_UWP_APP is set, the Visual Studio environment will be
          set up to point to the Windows Store compatible libraries and
          Visual Studio runtimes. In doing so, any libraries that are
          built will be able to be used in a UWP App and published to the
          Windows Store. This flag will only have an effect with Visual
          Studio 2015+. This variable must be passed as an argument to the
          Environment() constructor; setting it later has no effect.

          Valid values are '1' or '0'

   MSVC_VERSION
          Sets the preferred version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ to use.

          If $MSVC_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the
          latest version of Visual C/C++ installed on your system. If the
          specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will
          fail. This variable must be passed as an argument to the
          Environment() constructor; setting it later has no effect.

          Valid values for Windows are 14.2, 14.1, 14.0, 14.0Exp, 12.0,
          12.0Exp, 11.0, 11.0Exp, 10.0, 10.0Exp, 9.0, 9.0Exp, 8.0, 8.0Exp,
          7.1, 7.0, and 6.0. Versions ending in Exp refer to "Express" or
          "Express for Desktop" editions.

   MSVS
          When the Microsoft Visual Studio tools are initialized, they set
          up this dictionary with the following keys:

        VERSION
                the version of MSVS being used (can be set via
                [1372]$MSVS_VERSION)

        VERSIONS
                the available versions of MSVS installed

        VCINSTALLDIR
                installed directory of Visual C++

        VSINSTALLDIR
                installed directory of Visual Studio

        FRAMEWORKDIR
                installed directory of the .NET framework

        FRAMEWORKVERSIONS
                list of installed versions of the .NET framework, sorted
                latest to oldest.

        FRAMEWORKVERSION
                latest installed version of the .NET framework

        FRAMEWORKSDKDIR
                installed location of the .NET SDK.

        PLATFORMSDKDIR
                installed location of the Platform SDK.

        PLATFORMSDK_MODULES
                dictionary of installed Platform SDK modules, where the
                dictionary keys are keywords for the various modules, and
                the values are 2-tuples where the first is the release
                date, and the second is the version number.

          If a value is not set, it was not available in the registry.

   MSVS_ARCH
          Sets the architecture for which the generated project(s) should
          build.

          The default value is x86. amd64 is also supported by SCons for
          most Visual Studio versions. Since Visual Studio 2015 arm is
          supported, and since Visual Studio 2017 arm64 is supported.
          Trying to set $MSVS_ARCH to an architecture that's not supported
          for a given Visual Studio version will generate an error.

   MSVS_PROJECT_GUID
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          file as the value of the ProjectGUID attribute. There is no
          default value. If not defined, a new GUID is generated.

   MSVS_SCC_AUX_PATH
          The path name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccAuxPath attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. There is no
          default value.

   MSVS_SCC_CONNECTION_ROOT
          The root path of projects in your SCC workspace, i.e the path
          under which all project and solution files will be generated. It
          is used as a reference path from which the relative paths of the
          generated Microsoft Visual Studio project and solution files are
          computed. The relative project file path is placed as the value
          of the SccLocalPath attribute of the project file and as the
          values of the SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection[i]
          (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of projects in the
          solution) attributes of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl)
          section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. Similarly
          the relative solution file path is placed as the values of the
          SccLocalPath[i] (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of
          projects in the solution) attributes of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. This is used only if the MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER
          construction variable is also set. The default value is the
          current working directory.

   MSVS_SCC_PROJECT_NAME
          The project name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project file as the value of the SccProjectName attribute if the
          MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. In this
          case the string is also placed in the SccProjectName0 attribute
          of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft
          Visual Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER
          The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          file as the value of the SccProvider attribute. The string is
          also placed in the SccProvider0 attribute of the
          GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
          Studio solution file. There is no default value.

   MSVS_VERSION
          Sets the preferred version of Microsoft Visual Studio to use.

          If $MSVS_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the
          latest version of Visual Studio installed on your system. So, if
          you have version 6 and version 7 (MSVS .NET) installed, it will
          prefer version 7. You can override this by specifying the
          MSVS_VERSION variable in the Environment initialization, setting
          it to the appropriate version ('6.0' or '7.0', for example). If
          the specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will
          fail.

          This is obsolete: use $MSVC_VERSION instead. If $MSVS_VERSION is
          set and $MSVC_VERSION is not, $MSVC_VERSION will be set
          automatically to $MSVS_VERSION. If both are set to different
          values, scons will raise an error.

   MSVSBUILDCOM
          The build command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified build targets.

   MSVSCLEANCOM
          The clean command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with the -c option to remove any specified targets.

   MSVSENCODING
          The encoding string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is encoding Windows-1252.

   MSVSPROJECTCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files.

   MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio project (DSP) files.
          The default value is .vcproj when using Visual Studio version
          7.x (.NET) or later version, and .dsp when using earlier
          versions of Visual Studio.

   MSVSREBUILDCOM
          The rebuild command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke
          SCons with any specified rebuild targets.

   MSVSSCONS
          The SCons used in generated Microsoft Visual Studio project
          files. The default is the version of SCons being used to
          generate the project file.

   MSVSSCONSCOM
          The default SCons command used in generated Microsoft Visual
          Studio project files.

   MSVSSCONSCRIPT
          The sconscript file (that is, SConstruct or SConscript file)
          that will be invoked by Visual Studio project files (through the
          [1373]$MSVSSCONSCOM variable). The default is the same
          sconscript file that contains the call to MSVSProject to build
          the project file.

   MSVSSCONSFLAGS
          The SCons flags used in generated Microsoft Visual Studio
          project files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONCOM
          The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio solution
          files.

   MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX
          The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio solution (DSW)
          files. The default value is .sln when using Visual Studio
          version 7.x (.NET), and .dsw when using earlier versions of
          Visual Studio.

   MT
          The program used on Windows systems to embed manifests into DLLs
          and EXEs. See also [1374]$WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST.

   MTEXECOM

          (Windows only).

   MTSHLIBCOM
          The Windows command line used to embed manifests into shared
          libraries (DLLs). See also [1377]$MTEXECOM.

   MWCW_VERSION
          The version number of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C compiler to
          be used.

   MWCW_VERSIONS
          A list of installed versions of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C
          compiler on this system.

   NAME
          Specfies the name of the project to package.

   no_import_lib
          When set to non-zero, suppresses creation of a corresponding
          Windows static import lib by the SharedLibrary builder when used
          with MinGW, Microsoft Visual Studio or Metrowerks. This also
          suppresses creation of an export (.exp) file when using
          Microsoft Visual Studio.

   OBJPREFIX
          The prefix used for (static) object file names.

   OBJSUFFIX
          The suffix used for (static) object file names.

   PACKAGEROOT
          Specifies the directory where all files in resulting archive
          will be placed if applicable. The default value is
          "$NAME-$VERSION".

   PACKAGETYPE
          Selects the package type to build. Currently these are
          available:

          * msi - Microsoft Installer * rpm - Redhat Package Manger * ipkg
          - Itsy Package Management System * tarbz2 - compressed tar *
          targz - compressed tar * zip - zip file * src_tarbz2 -
          compressed tar source * src_targz - compressed tar source *
          src_zip - zip file source

          This may be overridden with the "package_type" command line
          option.

   PACKAGEVERSION
          The version of the package (not the underlying project). This is
          currently only used by the rpm packager and should reflect
          changes in the packaging, not the underlying project code
          itself.

   PCH
          The Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header that will be used
          when compiling object files. This variable is ignored by tools
          other than Microsoft Visual C++. When this variable is defined
          SCons will add options to the compiler command line to cause it
          to use the precompiled header, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PCH file. Example:

env['PCH'] = 'StdAfx.pch'

   PCHCOM
          The command line used by the PCH builder to generated a
          precompiled header.

   PCHCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a precompiled header. If
          this is not set, then [1378]$PCHCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   PCHPDBFLAGS
          A construction variable that, when expanded, adds the /yD flag
          to the command line only if the $PDB construction variable is
          set.

   PCHSTOP
          This variable specifies how much of a source file is
          precompiled. This variable is ignored by tools other than
          Microsoft Visual C++, or when the PCH variable is not being
          used. When this variable is define it must be a string that is
          the name of the header that is included at the end of the
          precompiled portion of the source files, or the empty string if
          the "#pragma hrdstop" construct is being used:

env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'

   PDB
          The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging
          information for object files, shared libraries, and programs.
          This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual
          C++. When this variable is defined SCons will add options to the
          compiler and linker command line to cause them to generate
          external debugging information, and will also set up the
          dependencies for the PDB file. Example:

env['PDB'] = 'hello.pdb'

          The Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default to
          generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with
          parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in
          the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single
          PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only
          way to get debug information embedded into a static library.
          Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance,
          although parallel builds will no longer work. You can generate
          PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the default
          [1379]$CCPDBFLAGS variable; see the entry for that variable for
          specific examples.

   PDFCOM
          A deprecated synonym for [1380]$DVIPDFCOM.

   PDFLATEX
          The pdflatex utility.

   PDFLATEXCOM
          The command line used to call the pdflatex utility.

   PDFLATEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the pdflatex utility. If this
          is not set, then [1381]$PDFLATEXCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

env = Environment(PDFLATEX;COMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES"
)

   PDFLATEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the pdflatex utility.

   PDFPREFIX
          The prefix used for PDF file names.

   PDFSUFFIX
          The suffix used for PDF file names.

   PDFTEX
          The pdftex utility.

   PDFTEXCOM
          The command line used to call the pdftex utility.

   PDFTEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the pdftex utility. If this is
          not set, then [1382]$PDFTEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(PDFTEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

   PDFTEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the pdftex utility.

   PKGCHK
          On Solaris systems, the package-checking program that will be
          used (along with $PKGINFO) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is /usr/sbin/pgkchk.

   PKGINFO
          On Solaris systems, the package information program that will be
          used (along with $PKGCHK) to look for installed versions of the
          Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is pkginfo.

   PLATFORM
          The name of the platform used to create the Environment. If no
          platform is specified when the Environment is created, scons
          autodetects the platform.

env = Environment(tools = [])
if env['PLATFORM'] == 'cygwin':
    Tool('mingw')(env)
else:
    Tool('msvc')(env)

   POAUTOINIT
          The $POAUTOINIT variable, if set to True (on non-zero numeric
          value), let the [1383]msginit tool to automatically initialize
          missing PO files with msginit(1). This applies to both,
          [1384]POInit and [1385]POUpdate builders (and others that use
          any of them).

   POCREATE_ALIAS
          Common alias for all PO files created with POInit builder
          (default: 'po-create'). See [1386]msginit tool and [1387]POInit
          builder.

   POSUFFIX
          Suffix used for PO files (default: '.po') See [1388]msginit tool
          and [1389]POInit builder.

   POTDOMAIN
          The $POTDOMAIN defines default domain, used to generate POT
          filename as $POTDOMAIN.pot when no POT file name is provided by
          the user. This applies to [1390]POTUpdate, [1391]POInit and
          [1392]POUpdate builders (and builders, that use them, e.g.
          Translate). Normally (if $POTDOMAIN is not defined), the
          builders use messages.pot as default POT file name.

   POTSUFFIX
          Suffix used for PO Template files (default: '.pot'). See
          [1393]xgettext tool and [1394]POTUpdate builder.

   POTUPDATE_ALIAS
          Name of the common phony target for all PO Templates created
          with [1395]POUpdate (default: 'pot-update'). See [1396]xgettext
          tool and [1397]POTUpdate builder.

   POUPDATE_ALIAS
          Common alias for all PO files being defined with [1398]POUpdate
          builder (default: 'po-update'). See [1399]msgmerge tool and
          [1400]POUpdate builder.

   PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC
          A Python function used to print the command lines as they are
          executed (assuming command printing is not disabled by the -q or
          -s options or their equivalents). The function should take four
          arguments: s, the command being executed (a string), target, the
          target being built (file node, list, or string name(s)), source,
          the source(s) used (file node, list, or string name(s)), and
          env, the environment being used.

          The function must do the printing itself. The default
          implementation, used if this variable is not set or is None, is:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
  sys.stdout.write(s + "\n")

          Here's an example of a more interesting function:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
   sys.stdout.write("Building %s -> %s...\n" %
    (' and '.join([str(x) for x in source]),
     ' and '.join([str(x) for x in target])))
env=Environment(PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC=print_cmd_line)
env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

          This just prints "Building targetname from sourcename..."
          instead of the actual commands. Such a function could also log
          the actual commands to a log file, for example.

   PROGEMITTER
          Contains the emitter specification for the [1401]Program
          builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general
          information on specifying emitters.

          variable.

   QT_DEBUG
          Prints lots of debugging information while scanning for moc
          files.

   QT_LIB
          Default value is 'qt'. You may want to set this to 'qt-mt'.

          the [1406]$LIBS variable.

   QT_LIBPATH
          The path where the qt libraries are installed. The default value
          is '[1407]$QTDIR/lib'. Note: If you set this variable to None,

   QTDIR
          The qt tool tries to take this from os.environ. It also
          initializes all QT_* construction variables listed below. (Note
          that all paths are constructed with python's os.path.join()
          method, but are listed here with the '/' separator for easier
          reading.) In addition, the construction environment variables
          [1416]$CPPPATH, [1417]$LIBPATH and [1418]$LIBS may be modified
          and the variables [1419]$PROGEMITTER, [1420]$SHLIBEMITTER and
          [1421]$LIBEMITTER are modified. Because the build-performance is
          affected when using this tool, you have to explicitly specify it
          at Environment creation:

Environment(tools=['default','qt'])

          The qt tool supports the following operations:

          Automatic moc file generation from header files. You do not have
          to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you.
          However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header
          file must have the same filebase as your implementation file and
          must stay in the same directory. It must have one of the
          suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You can turn off automatic moc
          file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0. See also the
          corresponding Moc() builder method.

          Automatic moc file generation from cxx files. As stated in the
          qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of the cxx
          file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated
          by the transformation
          ${QT_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
          <basename>.moc. A warning is generated after building the moc
          file, if you do not include the correct file. If you are using
          VariantDir, you may need to specify duplicate=1. You can turn
          off automatic moc file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0.
          See also the corresponding Moc builder method.

          Automatic handling of .ui files. The implementation files
          generated from .ui files are handled much the same as yacc or
          lex files. Each .ui file given as a source of Program, Library
          or SharedLibrary will generate three files, the declaration
          file, the implementation file and a moc file. Because there are
          also generated headers, you may need to specify duplicate=1 in
          calls to VariantDir. See also the corresponding Uic builder
          method.

   RANLIB
          The archive indexer.

   RANLIBCOM
          The command line used to index a static library archive.

          respectively prepending and appending $RCINCPREFIX and
          $RCINCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $CPPPATH.

   RCINCPREFIX
          The prefix (flag) used to specify an include directory on the
          resource compiler command line. This will be prepended to the

          variable when the $RCINCFLAGS variable is expanded.

   RCINCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the resource
          compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of each
          directory in the $CPPPATH construction variable when the
          $RCINCFLAGS variable is expanded.

          this is not set, then [1424]$REGSVRCOM (the command line) is
          displayed.

   REGSVRFLAGS
          Flags passed to the DLL registration program on Windows systems
          when a newly-built DLL library is registered. By default, this

          included on this command line.

   RMICCOMSTR
          The string displayed when compiling stub and skeleton class
          files from Java classes that contain RMI implementations. If
          this is not set, then [1426]$RMICCOM (the command line) is

   _RPATH
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          rpath flags to be used when linking a program with shared
          libraries. The value of $_RPATH is created by respectively
          prepending $RPATHPREFIX and appending $RPATHSUFFIX to the
          beginning and end of each directory in $RPATH.

   RPATH
          A list of paths to search for shared libraries when running
          programs. Currently only used in the GNU (gnulink), IRIX
          (sgilink) and Sun (sunlink) linkers. Ignored on platforms and
          toolchains that don't support it. Note that the paths added to
          RPATH are not transformed by scons in any way: if you want an
          absolute path, you must make it absolute yourself.

   RPATHPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared
          libraries when running programs. This will be prepended to the
          beginning of each directory in the $RPATH construction variable
          when the $_RPATH variable is automatically generated.

   RPATHSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify a directory to be searched for shared

          [1430]$RPCGENFLAGS construction variable.

   SCANNERS
          A list of the available implicit dependency scanners. New file
          scanners may be added by appending to this list, although the
          more flexible approach is to associate scanners with a specific
          Builder. See the manpage sections "Builder Objects" and "Scanner
          Objects" for more information.

   SCONS_HOME
          The (optional) path to the SCons library directory, initialized
          from the external environment. If set, this is used to construct

          objects. You should normally set the [1439]$SHFORTRAN variable,
          which specifies the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran
          versions. You only need to set [1440]$SHF03 if you need to use a
          specific compiler or compiler version for Fortran 03 files.

   SHF03COM
          The command line used to compile a Fortran 03 source file to a
          shared-library object file. You only need to set [1441]$SHF03COM
          if you need to use a specific command line for Fortran 03 files.
          You should normally set the [1442]$SHFORTRANCOM variable, which
          specifies the default command line for all Fortran versions.

   SHF03COMSTR
          The string displayed when a Fortran 03 source file is compiled

          [1449]$SHF03PPCOM if you need to use a specific C-preprocessor
          command line for Fortran 03 files. You should normally set the
          [1450]$SHFORTRANPPCOM variable, which specifies the default
          C-preprocessor command line for all Fortran versions.

   SHF03PPCOMSTR

          (e.g. [1516]gnulink).

   SHLIBSUFFIX
          The suffix used for shared library file names.

   SHLIBVERSION
          When this construction variable is defined, a versioned shared
          library is created by the [1517]SharedLibrary builder. This
          activates the [1518]$_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and thus modifies the
          [1519]$SHLINKCOM as required, adds the version number to the
          library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed.
          [1520]$SHLIBVERSION versions should exist as alpha-numeric,
          decimal-delimited values as defined by the regular expression
          "\w+[\.\w+]*". Example [1521]$SHLIBVERSION values include '1',
          '1.2.3', and '1.2.gitaa412c8b'.

   _SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          This macro automatically introduces extra flags to
          [1522]$SHLINKCOM when building versioned [1523]SharedLibrary
          (that is when [1524]$SHLIBVERSION is set). _SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          usually adds [1525]$SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and some extra dynamically
          generated options (such as -Wl,-soname=$_SHLIBSONAME. It is
          unused by "plain" (unversioned) shared libraries.

   SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS
          Extra flags added to [1526]$SHLINKCOM when building versioned
          [1527]SharedLibrary. These flags are only used when

          [1530]$LIBS, nor -L (or similar) include search path options
          that scons generates automatically from [1531]$LIBPATH. See
          [1532]$_LIBFLAGS above, for the variable that expands to
          library-link options, and [1533]$_LIBDIRFLAGS above, for the
          variable that expands to library search path options.

   SHOBJPREFIX
          The prefix used for shared object file names.

          arguments:

def spawn(shell, escape, cmd, args, env):

          sh is a string naming the shell program to use. escape is a
          function that can be called to escape shell special characters

          are assumed to be the same; that is, SCons does not check for
          linking static objects into a shared library.

   SUBST_DICT
          The dictionary used by the Substfile or Textfile builders for
          substitution values. It can be anything acceptable to the dict()
          constructor, so in addition to a dictionary, lists of tuples are
          also acceptable.

          interface generator.

   SWIGCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the scripting language wrapper
          and interface generator. If this is not set, then [1537]$SWIGCOM
          (the command line) is displayed.

   SWIGCXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ source files
          generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface
          generator. The default value is _wrap[1538]$CFILESUFFIX. By
          default, this value is used whenever the -c++ option is
          specified as part of the [1539]$SWIGFLAGS construction variable.

   SWIGDIRECTORSUFFIX
          The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ header files
          generated by the scripting language wrapper and interface
          generator. These are only generated for C++ code when the SWIG
          'directors' feature is turned on. The default value is _wrap.h.

   SWIGFLAGS
          General options passed to the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generator. This is where you should set -python,
          -perl5, -tcl, or whatever other options you want to specify to
          SWIG. If you set the -c++ option in this variable, scons will,
          by default, generate a C++ intermediate source file with the
          extension that is specified as the [1540]$CXXFILESUFFIX
          variable.

   _SWIGINCFLAGS
          An automatically-generated construction variable containing the
          SWIG command-line options for specifying directories to be
          searched for included files. The value of $_SWIGINCFLAGS is
          created by respectively prepending and appending $SWIGINCPREFIX
          and $SWIGINCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $SWIGPATH.

   SWIGINCPREFIX
          The prefix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be prepended to the beginning of each
          directory in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the
          $_SWIGINCFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGINCSUFFIX
          The suffix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG
          command line. This will be appended to the end of each directory
          in the $SWIGPATH construction variable when the $_SWIGINCFLAGS
          variable is automatically generated.

   SWIGOUTDIR
          Specifies the output directory in which the scripting language
          wrapper and interface generator should place generated
          language-specific files. This will be used by SCons to identify
          the files that will be generated by the swig call, and
          translated into the swig -outdir option on the command line.

   SWIGPATH
          The list of directories that the scripting language wrapper and
          interface generate will search for included files. The SWIG
          implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for
          include files. The default value is an empty list.

          Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in SWIGFLAGS;
          the result will be non-portable and the directories will not be
          searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in
          SWIGPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory
          when they are used in a command. To force scons to look-up a
          directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:

env = Environment(SWIGPATH='#/include')

          The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir()
          function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(SWIGPATH=include)

          The directory list will be added to command lines through the
          automatically-generated $_SWIGINCFLAGS construction variable,
          which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending
          the values of the $SWIGINCPREFIX and $SWIGINCSUFFIX construction
          variables to the beginning and end of each directory in
          $SWIGPATH. Any command lines you define that need the SWIGPATH
          directory list should include $_SWIGINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(SWIGCOM="my_swig -o $TARGET $_SWIGINCFLAGS $SOURCES")

   SWIGVERSION
          The version number of the SWIG tool.

   TAR
          The tar archiver.

          The string displayed when archiving files using the tar
          archiver. If this is not set, then [1541]$TARCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

   TARFLAGS
          General options passed to the tar archiver.

   TARGET
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   TARGET_ARCH
          The name of the target hardware architecture for the compiled
          objects created by this Environment. This defaults to the value
          of HOST_ARCH, and the user can override it. Currently only set
          for Win32.

          Sets the target architecture for Visual Studio compiler (i.e.
          the arch of the binaries generated by the compiler). If not set,
          default to $HOST_ARCH, or, if that is unset, to the architecture
          of the running machine's OS (note that the python build or
          architecture has no effect). This variable must be passed as an
          argument to the Environment() constructor; setting it later has
          no effect. This is currently only used on Windows, but in the
          future it will be used on other OSes as well. If this is set and
          MSVC_VERSION is not set, this will search for all installed
          MSVC's that support the TARGET_ARCH, selecting the latest
          version for use.

          Valid values for Windows are x86, arm, i386 (for 32 bits);
          amd64, arm64, emt64, x86_64 (for 64 bits); and ia64 (Itanium).
          For example, if you want to compile 64-bit binaries, you would
          set TARGET_ARCH='x86_64' in your SCons environment.

   TARGET_OS
          The name of the target operating system for the compiled objects
          created by this Environment. This defaults to the value of
          HOST_OS, and the user can override it. Currently only set for
          Win32.

   TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   TARSUFFIX
          The suffix used for tar file names.

   TEMPFILEARGJOIN
          The string (or character) to be used to join the arguments
          passed to TEMPFILE when command line exceeds the limit set by
          $MAXLINELENGTH. The default value is a space. However for MSVC,
          MSLINK the default is a line seperator characters as defined by
          os.linesep. Note this value is used literally and not expanded
          by the subst logic.

   TEMPFILEPREFIX
          The prefix for a temporary file used to store lines lines longer
          than $MAXLINELENGTH as operations which call out to a shell will
          fail if the line is too long, which particularly impacts
          linking. The default is '@', which works for the Microsoft and
          GNU toolchains on Windows. Set this appropriately for other
          toolchains, for example '-@' for the diab compiler or '-via' for
          ARM toolchain.

   TEMPFILESUFFIX
          The suffix used for the temporary file name used for long
          command lines. The name should include the dot ('.') if one is
          wanted as it will not be added automatically. The default is
          '.lnk'.

   TEX
          The TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXCOM
          The command line used to call the TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXCOMSTR
          The string displayed when calling the TeX formatter and
          typesetter. If this is not set, then [1542]$TEXCOM (the command
          line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

   TEXFLAGS
          General options passed to the TeX formatter and typesetter.

   TEXINPUTS
          List of directories that the LaTeX program will search for
          include directories. The LaTeX implicit dependency scanner will
          search these directories for \include and \import files.

   TEXTFILEPREFIX
          The prefix used for Textfile file names, the null string by
          default.

          The suffix used for Textfile file names; .txt by default.

   TOOLS
          A list of the names of the Tool specifications that are part of
          this construction environment.

   UNCHANGED_SOURCES
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

   UNCHANGED_TARGETS
          A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a
          construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable
          Substitution" for more information).

          return appended. This is useful if some specific RPM feature not
          otherwise anticipated by SCons needs to be turned on or off.
          Note if this variable is omitted, SCons will by default supply
          the value '%global debug_package %{nil}' to disable debug
          package generation. To enable debug package generation, include
          this variable set either to None, or to a custom list that does

   XGETTEXTCOM
          Complete xgettext command line. See [1553]xgettext tool and
          [1554]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTCOMSTR
          A string that is shown when xgettext(1) command is invoked
          (default: '', which means "print [1555]$XGETTEXTCOM"). See

   XGETTEXTFLAGS
          Additional flags to xgettext(1). See [1558]xgettext tool and
          [1559]POTUpdate builder.

   XGETTEXTFROM
          Name of file containing list of xgettext(1)'s source files.
          Autotools' users know this as POTFILES.in so they will in most
          cases set XGETTEXTFROM="POTFILES.in" here. The $XGETTEXTFROM
          files have same syntax and semantics as the well known GNU
          POTFILES.in. See [1560]xgettext tool and [1561]POTUpdate
          builder.

   _XGETTEXTFROMFLAGS

          (default: '')

   XGETTEXTPATH
          List of directories, there xgettext(1) will look for source
          files (default: []).

Note

          This variable works only together with [1564]$XGETTEXTFROM

          See also [1565]xgettext tool and [1566]POTUpdate builder.

   YACC
          The parser generator.

   YACCCOM
          The command line used to call the parser generator to generate a
          source file.

   YACCCOMSTR
          The string displayed when generating a source file using the
          parser generator. If this is not set, then [1568]$YACCCOM (the
          command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(YACCCOMSTR = "Yacc'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

   YACCFLAGS
          General options passed to the parser generator. If
          [1569]$YACCFLAGS contains a -d option, SCons assumes that the
          call will also create a .h file (if the yacc source file ends in
          a .y suffix) or a .hpp file (if the yacc source file ends in a
          .yy suffix)

   YACCHFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option is used. Note that setting this
          variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          header file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .h.

   YACCHXXFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the C++ header file generated by the parser
          generator when the -d option is used. Note that setting this
          variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          header file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .hpp, except on Mac OS X, where the
          default is ${TARGET.suffix}.h. because the default bison parser
          generator just appends .h to the name of the generated C++ file.

   YACCVCGFILESUFFIX
          The suffix of the file containing the VCG grammar automaton
          definition when the --graph= option is used. Note that setting
          this variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a
          VCG file with the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to
          specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its own
          accord. The default value is .vcg.

   ZIP
          The zip compression and file packaging utility.

   ZIPCOM
          The command line used to call the zip utility, or the internal
          Python function used to create a zip archive.

   ZIPCOMPRESSION
          The compression flag from the Python zipfile module used by the
          internal Python function to control whether the zip archive is
          compressed or not. The default value is zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED,
          which creates a compressed zip archive. This value has no effect
          if the zipfile module is unavailable.

   ZIPCOMSTR
          The string displayed when archiving files using the zip utility.
          If this is not set, then [1570]$ZIPCOM (the command line or
          internal Python function) is displayed.

env = Environment(ZIPCOMSTR = "Zipping $TARGET")

   ZIPFLAGS
          General options passed to the zip utility.

   ZIPROOT
          An optional zip root directory (default empty). The filenames
          stored in the zip file will be relative to this directory, if
          given. Otherwise the filenames are relative to the current
          directory of the command. For instance:

env = Environment()
env.Zip('foo.zip', 'subdir1/subdir2/file1', ZIPROOT='subdir1')

          will produce a zip file foo.zip containing a file with the name
          subdir2/file1 rather than subdir1/subdir2/file1.

   ZIPSUFFIX
          The suffix used for zip file names.

   Construction variables can be retrieved and set using the Dictionary
   method of the construction environment:
cvars = env.Dictionary()
cvars["CC"] = "cc"

   or using the key lookup operator [] directly on the construction
   environment:
env["CC"] = "cc"

   Construction variables can also be passed to the construction
   environment constructor:
env = Environment(CC="cc")

   or when copying a construction environment using the Clone method:
env2 = env.Clone(CC="cl.exe")

Configure Contexts

   scons supports configure contexts, an integrated mechanism similar to
   the various AC_CHECK macros in GNU autoconf for testing for the
   existence of C header files, libraries, etc. In contrast to autoconf,
   scons does not maintain an explicit cache of the tested values, but
   uses its normal dependency tracking to keep the checked values up to
   date. However, users may override this behaviour with the --config
   command line option.

   The following methods can be used to perform checks:

   Configure(env, [custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h, clean,
          help]), env.Configure([custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file,
          config_h, clean, help])
          This creates a configure context, which can be used to perform
          checks. env specifies the environment for building the tests.
          This environment may be modified when performing checks.
          custom_tests is a dictionary containing custom tests. See also
          the section about custom tests below. By default, no custom
          tests are added to the configure context. conf_dir specifies a
          directory where the test cases are built. Note that this
          directory is not used for building normal targets. The default
          value is the directory #/.sconf_temp. log_file specifies a file
          which collects the output from commands that are executed to
          check for the existence of header files, libraries, etc. The
          default is the file #/config.log. If you are using the
          VariantDir() method, you may want to specify a subdirectory
          under your variant directory. config_h specifies a C header file
          where the results of tests will be written, e.g. #define
          HAVE_STDIO_H, #define HAVE_LIBM, etc. The default is to not
          write a config.h file. You can specify the same config.h file in
          multiple calls to Configure, in which case scons will
          concatenate all results in the specified file. Note that SCons
          uses its normal dependency checking to decide if it's necessary
          to rebuild the specified config_h file. This means that the file
          is not necessarily re-built each time scons is run, but is only
          rebuilt if its contents will have changed and some target that
          depends on the config_h file is being built.

          The optional clean and help arguments can be used to suppress
          execution of the configuration tests when the -c/--clean or
          -H/-h/--help options are used, respectively. The default
          behavior is always to execute configure context tests, since the
          results of the tests may affect the list of targets to be
          cleaned or the help text. If the configure tests do not affect
          these, then you may add the clean=False or help=False arguments
          (or both) to avoid unnecessary test execution.

   A created Configure instance has the following associated methods:

   SConf.Finish(context), sconf.Finish()
          This method should be called after configuration is done. It
          returns the environment as modified by the configuration checks
          performed. After this method is called, no further checks can be
          performed with this configuration context. However, you can
          create a new Configure context to perform additional checks.
          Only one context should be active at a time.

          The following Checks are predefined. (This list will likely grow
          larger as time goes by and developers contribute new useful
          tests.)

   SConf.CheckHeader(context, header, [include_quotes, language]),
          sconf.CheckHeader(header, [include_quotes, language])
          Checks if header is usable in the specified language. header may
          be a list, in which case the last item in the list is the header
          file to be checked, and the previous list items are header files
          whose #include lines should precede the header line being
          checked for. The optional argument include_quotes must be a two
          character string, where the first character denotes the opening
          quote and the second character denotes the closing quote. By
          default, both characters are " (double quote). The optional
          argument language should be either C or C++ and selects the
          compiler to be used for the check. Returns 1 on success and 0 on
          failure.

   SConf.CheckCHeader(context, header, [include_quotes]),
          sconf.CheckCHeader(header, [include_quotes])
          This is a wrapper around SConf.CheckHeader which checks if
          header is usable in the C language. header may be a list, in
          which case the last item in the list is the header file to be
          checked, and the previous list items are header files whose
          #include lines should precede the header line being checked for.
          The optional argument include_quotes must be a two character
          string, where the first character denotes the opening quote and
          the second character denotes the closing quote (both default to
          \N'34'). Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

   SConf.CheckCXXHeader(context, header, [include_quotes]),
          sconf.CheckCXXHeader(header, [include_quotes])
          This is a wrapper around SConf.CheckHeader which checks if
          header is usable in the C++ language. header may be a list, in
          which case the last item in the list is the header file to be
          checked, and the previous list items are header files whose
          #include lines should precede the header line being checked for.
          The optional argument include_quotes must be a two character
          string, where the first character denotes the opening quote and
          the second character denotes the closing quote (both default to
          \N'34'). Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

   SConf.CheckFunc(context,, function_name, [header, language]),
          sconf.CheckFunc(function_name, [header, language])
          Checks if the specified C or C++ function is available.
          function_name is the name of the function to check for. The
          optional header argument is a string that will be placed at the
          top of the test file that will be compiled to check if the
          function exists; the default is:

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
#endif
char function_name();

          The optional language argument should be C or C++ and selects
          the compiler to be used for the check; the default is "C".

   SConf.CheckLib(context, [library, symbol, header, language,
          autoadd=1]), sconf.CheckLib([library, symbol, header, language,
          autoadd=1])
          Checks if library provides symbol. If the value of autoadd is 1
          and the library provides the specified symbol, appends the
          library to the LIBS construction environment variable. library
          may also be None (the default), in which case symbol is checked
          with the current LIBS variable, or a list of library names, in
          which case each library in the list will be checked for symbol.
          If symbol is not set or is None, then SConf.CheckLib() just
          checks if you can link against the specified library. The
          optional language argument should be C or C++ and selects the
          compiler to be used for the check; the default is "C". The
          default value for autoadd is 1. This method returns 1 on success
          and 0 on error.

   SConf.CheckLibWithHeader(context, library, header, language, [call,
          autoadd]), sconf.CheckLibWithHeader(library, header, language,
          [call, autoadd])
          In contrast to the SConf.CheckLib call, this call provides a
          more sophisticated way to check against libraries. Again,
          library specifies the library or a list of libraries to check.
          header specifies a header to check for. header may be a list, in
          which case the last item in the list is the header file to be
          checked, and the previous list items are header files whose
          #include lines should precede the header line being checked for.
          language may be one of 'C','c','CXX','cxx','C++' and 'c++'. call
          can be any valid expression (with a trailing ';'). If call is
          not set, the default simply checks that you can link against the
          specified library. autoadd specifies whether to add the library
          to the environment (only if the check succeeds). This method
          returns 1 on success and 0 on error.

   SConf.CheckType(context, type_name, [includes, language]),
          sconf.CheckType(type_name, [includes, language])
          Checks for the existence of a type defined by typedef. type_name
          specifies the typedef name to check for. includes is a string
          containing one or more #include lines that will be inserted into
          the program that will be run to test for the existence of the
          type. The optional language argument should be C or C++ and
          selects the compiler to be used for the check; the default is
          "C". Example:

sconf.CheckType('foo_type', '#include "my_types.h"', 'C++')

   Configure.CheckCC(self)
          Checks whether the C compiler (as defined by the CC construction
          variable) works by trying to compile a small source file.

          By default, SCons only detects if there is a program with the
          correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler.

          This uses the exact same command than the one used by the object
          builder for C source file, so it can be used to detect if a
          particular compiler flag works or not.

   Configure.CheckCXX(self)
          Checks whether the C++ compiler (as defined by the CXX
          construction variable) works by trying to compile a small source
          file. By default, SCons only detects if there is a program with
          the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler.

          This uses the exact same command than the one used by the object
          builder for CXX source files, so it can be used to detect if a
          particular compiler flag works or not.

   Configure.CheckSHCC(self)
          Checks whether the C compiler (as defined by the SHCC
          construction variable) works by trying to compile a small source
          file. By default, SCons only detects if there is a program with
          the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler.

          This uses the exact same command than the one used by the object
          builder for C source file, so it can be used to detect if a
          particular compiler flag works or not. This does not check
          whether the object code can be used to build a shared library,
          only that the compilation (not link) succeeds.

   Configure.CheckSHCXX(self)
          Checks whether the C++ compiler (as defined by the SHCXX
          construction variable) works by trying to compile a small source
          file. By default, SCons only detects if there is a program with
          the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler.

          This uses the exact same command than the one used by the object
          builder for CXX source files, so it can be used to detect if a
          particular compiler flag works or not. This does not check
          whether the object code can be used to build a shared library,
          only that the compilation (not link) succeeds.

   Example of a typical Configure usage:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure( env )
if not conf.CheckCHeader( 'math.h' ):
    print('We really need math.h!')
    Exit(1)
if conf.CheckLibWithHeader( 'qt', 'qapp.h', 'c++',
        'QApplication qapp(0,0);' ):
    # do stuff for qt - usage, e.g.
    conf.env.Append( CPPFLAGS = '-DWITH_QT' )
env = conf.Finish()

   SConf.CheckTypeSize(context, type_name, [header, language, expect]),
          sconf.CheckTypeSize(type_name, [header, language, expect])
          Checks for the size of a type defined by typedef. type_name
          specifies the typedef name to check for. The optional header
          argument is a string that will be placed at the top of the test
          file that will be compiled to check if the function exists; the
          default is empty. The optional language argument should be C or
          C++ and selects the compiler to be used for the check; the
          default is "C". The optional expect argument should be an
          integer. If this argument is used, the function will only check
          whether the type given in type_name has the expected size (in
          bytes). For example, CheckTypeSize('short', expect = 2) will
          return success only if short is two bytes.


   SConf.CheckDeclaration(context, symbol, [includes, language]),
          sconf.CheckDeclaration(symbol, [includes, language])
          Checks if the specified symbol is declared. includes is a string
          containing one or more #include lines that will be inserted into
          the program that will be run to test for the existence of the
          type. The optional language argument should be C or C++ and
          selects the compiler to be used for the check; the default is
          "C".

   SConf.Define(context, symbol, [value, comment]), sconf.Define(symbol,
          [value, comment])
          This function does not check for anything, but defines a
          preprocessor symbol that will be added to the configuration
          header file. It is the equivalent of AC_DEFINE, and defines the
          symbol name with the optional value and the optional comment
          comment.

   Examples:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure( env )

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL
conf.Define('A_SYMBOL')

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL 1
conf.Define('A_SYMBOL', 1)

   Be careful about quoting string values, though:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure( env )

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL YA
conf.Define('A_SYMBOL', "YA")

# Puts the following line in the config header file:
#    #define A_SYMBOL "YA"
conf.Define('A_SYMBOL', '"YA"')

   For comment:
env = Environment()
conf = Configure( env )

# Puts the following lines in the config header file:
#    /* Set to 1 if you have a symbol */
#    #define A_SYMBOL 1
conf.Define('A_SYMBOL', 1, 'Set to 1 if you have a symbol')

   You can define your own custom checks. in addition to the predefined
   checks. These are passed in a dictionary to the Configure function.
   This dictionary maps the names of the checks to user defined Python
   callables (either Python functions or class instances implementing the
   __call__ method). The first argument of the call is always a
   CheckContext instance followed by the arguments, which must be supplied
   by the user of the check. These CheckContext instances define the
   following methods:

   CheckContext.Message(self, text)
          Usually called before the check is started. text will be
          displayed to the user, e.g. 'Checking for library X...'

   CheckContext.Result(self,, res)
          Usually called after the check is done. res can be either an
          integer or a string. In the former case, 'yes' (res != 0) or
          'no' (res == 0) is displayed to the user, in the latter case the
          given string is displayed.

   CheckContext.TryCompile(self, text, extension)
          Checks if a file with the specified extension (e.g. '.c')
          containing text can be compiled using the environment's Object
          builder. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

   CheckContext.TryLink(self, text, extension)
          Checks, if a file with the specified extension (e.g. '.c')
          containing text can be compiled using the environment's Program
          builder. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

   CheckContext.TryRun(self, text, extension)
          Checks, if a file with the specified extension (e.g. '.c')
          containing text can be compiled using the environment's Program
          builder. On success, the program is run. If the program executes
          successfully (that is, its return status is 0), a tuple (1,
          outputStr) is returned, where outputStr is the standard output
          of the program. If the program fails execution (its return
          status is non-zero), then (0, '') is returned.

   CheckContext.TryAction(self, action, [text, extension])
          Checks if the specified action with an optional source file
          (contents text , extension extension = '' ) can be executed.
          action may be anything which can be converted to a scons Action.
          On success, (1, outputStr) is returned, where outputStr is the
          content of the target file. On failure (0, '') is returned.

   CheckContext.TryBuild(self, builder, [text, extension])
          Low level implementation for testing specific builds; the
          methods above are based on this method. Given the Builder
          instance builder and the optional text of a source file with
          optional extension, this method returns 1 on success and 0 on
          failure. In addition, self.lastTarget is set to the build target
          node, if the build was successful.

   Example for implementing and using custom tests:
def CheckQt(context, qtdir):
    context.Message( 'Checking for qt ...' )
    lastLIBS = context.env['LIBS']
    lastLIBPATH = context.env['LIBPATH']
    lastCPPPATH= context.env['CPPPATH']
    context.env.Append(LIBS = 'qt', LIBPATH = qtdir + '/lib', CPPPATH = qtdir +
'/include' )
    ret = context.TryLink("""
#include <qapp.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  QApplication qapp(argc, argv);
  return 0;
}
""")
    if not ret:
        context.env.Replace(LIBS = lastLIBS, LIBPATH=lastLIBPATH, CPPPATH=lastCP
PPATH)
    context.Result( ret )
    return ret

env = Environment()
conf = Configure( env, custom_tests = { 'CheckQt' : CheckQt } )
if not conf.CheckQt('/usr/lib/qt'):
    print('We really need qt!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

Command-Line Construction Variables

   Often when building software, some variables must be specified at build
   time. For example, libraries needed for the build may be in
   non-standard locations, or site-specific compiler options may need to
   be passed to the compiler. scons provides a Variables object to support
   overriding construction variables on the command line:
$ scons VARIABLE=foo

   The variable values can also be specified in a text-based SConscript
   file. To create a Variables object, call the Variables() function:

   Variables([files], [args])
          This creates a Variables object that will read construction
          variables from the file or list of filenames specified in files.
          If no files are specified, or the files argument is None, then
          no files will be read. The optional argument args is a
          dictionary of values that will override anything read from the
          specified files; it is primarily intended to be passed the
          ARGUMENTS dictionary that holds variables specified on the
          command line. Example:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars = Variables('overrides.py', ARGUMENTS)
vars = Variables(None, {FOO:'expansion', BAR:7})

          Variables objects have the following methods:

   Add(key, [help, default, validator, converter])
          This adds a customizable construction variable to the Variables
          object. key is the name of the variable. help is the help text
          for the variable. default is the default value of the variable;
          if the default value is None and there is no explicit value
          specified, the construction variable will not be added to the
          construction environment. validator is called to validate the
          value of the variable, and should take three arguments: key,
          value, and environment. The recommended way to handle an invalid
          value is to raise an exception (see example below). converter is
          called to convert the value before putting it in the
          environment, and should take either a value, or the value and
          environment, as parameters. The converter must return a value,
          which will be converted into a string before being validated by
          the validator (if any) and then added to the environment.

          Examples:

vars.Add('CC', 'The C compiler')

def validate_color(key, val, env):
    if not val in ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']:
        raise Exception("Invalid color value '%s'" % val)
vars.Add('COLOR', validator=valid_color)

   AddVariables(list)
          A wrapper script that adds multiple customizable construction
          variables to a Variables object. list is a list of tuple or list
          objects that contain the arguments for an individual call to the
          Add method.

opt.AddVariables(
       ('debug', '', 0),
       ('CC', 'The C compiler'),
       ('VALIDATE', 'An option for testing validation',
        'notset', validator, None),
    )

   Update(env, [args])
          This updates a construction environment env with the customized
          construction variables. Any specified variables that are not
          configured for the Variables object will be saved and may be
          retrieved with the UnknownVariables() method, below.

          Normally this method is not called directly, but is called
          indirectly by passing the Variables object to the Environment()
          function:

env = Environment(variables=vars)

   The text file(s) that were specified when the Variables object was
   created are executed as Python scripts, and the values of (global)
   Python variables set in the file are added to the construction
   environment.

   Example:
CC = 'my_cc'

   UnknownVariables()
          Returns a dictionary containing any variables that were
          specified either in the files or the dictionary with which the
          Variables object was initialized, but for which the Variables
          object was not configured.

env = Environment(variables=vars)
for key, value in vars.UnknownVariables():
    print("unknown variable:  %s=%s" % (key, value))

   Save(filename, env)
          This saves the currently set variables into a script file named
          filename that can be used on the next invocation to
          automatically load the current settings. This method combined
          with the Variables method can be used to support caching of
          variables between runs.

env = Environment()
vars = Variables(['variables.cache', 'custom.py'])
vars.Add(...)
vars.Update(env)
vars.Save('variables.cache', env)

   GenerateHelpText(env, [sort])
          This generates help text documenting the customizable
          construction variables suitable to passing in to the Help()
          function. env is the construction environment that will be used
          to get the actual values of customizable variables. Calling with
          an optional sort function will cause the output to be sorted by
          the specified argument. The specific sort function should take
          two arguments and return -1, 0 or 1 (like the standard Python
          cmp function). Optionally a Boolean value of True for sort will
          cause a standard alphabetical sort to be performed

Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))
Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env, sort=cmp))

   FormatVariableHelpText(env, opt, help, default, actual)
          This method returns a formatted string containing the printable
          help text for one option. It is normally not called directly,
          but is called by the GenerateHelpText() method to create the
          returned help text. It may be overridden with your own function
          that takes the arguments specified above and returns a string of
          help text formatted to your liking. Note that the
          GenerateHelpText() will not put any blank lines or extra
          characters in between the entries, so you must add those
          characters to the returned string if you want the entries
          separated.

def my_format(env, opt, help, default, actual):
    fmt = "\n%s: default=%s actual=%s (%s)\n"
    return fmt % (opt, default. actual, help)
vars.FormatVariableHelpText = my_format

          To make it more convenient to work with customizable Variables,
          scons provides a number of functions that make it easy to set up
          various types of Variables:

   BoolVariable(key, help, default)
          Return a tuple of arguments to set up a Boolean option. The
          option will use the specified name key, have a default value of
          default, and display the specified help text. The option will
          interpret the values y, yes, t, true, 1, on and all as true, and
          the values n, no, f, false, 0, off and none as false.

   EnumVariable(key, help, default, allowed_values, [map, ignorecase])
          Return a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value may
          be one of a specified list of legal enumerated values. The
          option will use the specified name key, have a default value of
          default, and display the specified help text. The option will
          only support those values in the allowed_values list. The
          optional map argument is a dictionary that can be used to
          convert input values into specific legal values in the
          allowed_values list. If the value of ignore_case is 0 (the
          default), then the values are case-sensitive. If the value of
          ignore_case is 1, then values will be matched case-insensitive.
          If the value of ignore_case is 2, then values will be matched
          case-insensitive, and all input values will be converted to
          lower case.

   ListVariable(key, help, default, names, [,map])
          Return a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value may
          be one or more of a specified list of legal enumerated values.
          The option will use the specified name key, have a default value
          of default, and display the specified help text. The option will
          only support the values all, none, or the values in the names
          list. More than one value may be specified, with all values
          separated by commas. The default may be a string of
          comma-separated default values, or a list of the default values.
          The optional map argument is a dictionary that can be used to
          convert input values into specific legal values in the names
          list.

   PackageVariable(key, help, default)
          Return a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value is a
          path name of a package that may be enabled, disabled or given an
          explicit path name. The option will use the specified name key,
          have a default value of default, and display the specified help
          text. The option will support the values yes, true, on, enable
          or search, in which case the specified default will be used, or
          the option may be set to an arbitrary string (typically the path
          name to a package that is being enabled). The option will also
          support the values no, false, off or disable to disable use of
          the specified option.

   PathVariable(key, help, default, [validator])
          Return a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value is
          expected to be a path name. The option will use the specified
          name key, have a default value of default, and display the
          specified help text. An additional validator may be specified
          that will be called to verify that the specified path is
          acceptable. SCons supplies the following ready-made validators:
          PathVariable.PathExists (the default), which verifies that the
          specified path exists; PathVariable.PathIsFile, which verifies
          that the specified path is an existing file;
          PathVariable.PathIsDir, which verifies that the specified path
          is an existing directory; PathVariable.PathIsDirCreate, which
          verifies that the specified path is a directory and will create
          the specified directory if the path does not exist; and
          PathVariable.PathAccept, which simply accepts the specific path
          name argument without validation, and which is suitable if you
          want your users to be able to specify a directory path that will
          be created as part of the build process, for example. You may
          supply your own validator function, which must take three
          arguments (key, the name of the variable to be set; val, the
          specified value being checked; and env, the construction
          environment) and should raise an exception if the specified
          value is not acceptable.

   These functions make it convenient to create a number of variables with
   consistent behavior in a single call to the AddVariables method:
vars.AddVariables(
    BoolVariable('warnings', 'compilation with -Wall and similiar', 1),
    EnumVariable('debug', 'debug output and symbols', 'no'
               allowed_values=('yes', 'no', 'full'),
               map={}, ignorecase=0),  # case sensitive
    ListVariable('shared',
               'libraries to build as shared libraries',
               'all',
               names = list_of_libs),
    PackageVariable('x11',
                  'use X11 installed here (yes = search some places)',
                  'yes'),
    PathVariable('qtdir', 'where the root of Qt is installed', qtdir),
    PathVariable('foopath', 'where the foo library is installed', foopath,
               PathVariable.PathIsDir),

)

File and Directory Nodes

   The File() and Dir() functions return File and Dir Nodes, respectively.
   Python objects, respectively. Those objects have several user-visible
   attributes and methods that are often useful:

   path
          The build path of the given file or directory. This path is
          relative to the top-level directory (where the SConstruct file
          is found). The build path is the same as the source path if
          variant_dir is not being used.

   abspath
          The absolute build path of the given file or directory.

   srcnode()
          The srcnode() method returns another File or Dir object
          representing the source path of the given File or Dir. The

# Get the current build dir's path, relative to top.
Dir('.').path
# Current dir's absolute path
Dir('.').abspath
# Next line is always '.', because it is the top dir's path relative to itself.
Dir('#.').path
File('foo.c').srcnode().path   # source path of the given source file.

# Builders also return File objects:
foo = env.Program('foo.c')
print("foo will be built in %s"%foo.path)

          A Dir Node or File Node can also be used to create file and
          subdirectory Nodes relative to the generating Node. A Dir Node
          will place the new Nodes within the directory it represents. A
          File node will place the new Nodes within its parent directory
          (that is, "beside" the file in question). If d is a Dir
          (directory) Node and f is a File (file) Node, then these methods
          are available:

   d.Dir(name)
          Returns a directory Node for a subdirectory of d named name.

   d.File(name)
          Returns a file Node for a file within d named name.

   d.Entry(name)
          Returns an unresolved Node within d named name.

   f.Dir(name)
          Returns a directory named name within the parent directory of f.

   f.File(name)
          Returns a file named name within the parent directory of f.

   f.Entry(name)
          Returns an unresolved Node named name within the parent
          directory of f.

   For example:
# Get a Node for a file within a directory
incl = Dir('include')
f = incl.File('header.h')

# Get a Node for a subdirectory within a directory
dist = Dir('project-3.2.1')
src = dist.Dir('src')

# Get a Node for a file in the same directory
cfile = File('sample.c')
hfile = cfile.File('sample.h')

# Combined example
docs = Dir('docs')
html = docs.Dir('html')
index = html.File('index.html')
css = index.File('app.css')

EXTENDING SCONS

Builder Objects

   scons can be extended to build different types of targets by adding new
   Builder objects to a construction environment. In general, you should
   only need to add a new Builder object when you want to build a new type
   of file or other external target. If you just want to invoke a
   different compiler or other tool to build a Program, Object, Library,
   or any other type of output file for which scons already has an
   existing Builder, it is generally much easier to use those existing
   Builders in a construction environment that sets the appropriate
   construction variables (CC, LINK, etc.).

   Builder objects are created using the Builder function. The Builder
   function accepts the following arguments:

   action
          The command line string used to build the target from the
          source. action can also be: a list of strings representing the
          command to be executed and its arguments (suitable for enclosing
          white space in an argument), a dictionary mapping source file
          name suffixes to any combination of command line strings (if the
          builder should accept multiple source file extensions), a Python
          function; an Action object (see the next section); or a list of
          any of the above.

          An action function takes three arguments: source - a list of
          source nodes, target - a list of target nodes, env - the
          construction environment.

   prefix
          The prefix that will be prepended to the target file name. This
          may be specified as a:

     * string,
     * callable object - a function or other callable that takes two
     arguments (a construction environment and a list of sources) and
     returns a prefix,
     * dictionary - specifies a mapping from a specific source suffix (of
     the first source specified) to a corresponding target prefix. Both
     the source suffix and target prefix specifications may use
     environment variable substitution, and the target prefix (the
     'value' entries in the dictionary) may also be a callable object.
     The default target prefix may be indicated by a dictionary entry
     with a key value of None.

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
            prefix = "file-")

def gen_prefix(env, sources):
    return "file-" + env['PLATFORM'] + '-'
b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
            prefix = gen_prefix)

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
            suffix = { None: "file-",
                       "$SRC_SFX_A": gen_prefix })

   suffix
          The suffix that will be appended to the target file name. This
          may be specified in the same manner as the prefix above. If the
          suffix is a string, then scons will append a '.' to the
          beginning of the suffix if it's not already there. The string
          returned by callable object (or obtained from the dictionary) is
          untouched and must append its own '.' to the beginning if one is
          desired.

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET"
            suffix = "-file")

def gen_suffix(env, sources):
    return "." + env['PLATFORM'] + "-file"
b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
            suffix = gen_suffix)

b = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET",
            suffix = { None: ".sfx1",
                       "$SRC_SFX_A": gen_suffix })

   ensure_suffix
          When set to any true value, causes scons to add the target
          suffix specified by the suffix keyword to any target strings
          that have a different suffix. (The default behavior is to leave
          untouched any target file name that looks like it already has
          any suffix.)

b1 = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET"
             suffix = ".out")
b2 = Builder("build_it < $SOURCE > $TARGET"
             suffix = ".out",
             ensure_suffix)
env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS']['B1'] = b1
env['BUILDERS']['B2'] = b2

# Builds "foo.txt" because ensure_suffix is not set.
env.B1('foo.txt', 'foo.in')

# Builds "bar.txt.out" because ensure_suffix is set.
env.B2('bar.txt', 'bar.in')

   src_suffix
          The expected source file name suffix. This may be a string or a
          list of strings.

   target_scanner
          A Scanner object that will be invoked to find implicit
          dependencies for this target file. This keyword argument should
          be used for Scanner objects that find implicit dependencies
          based only on the target file and the construction environment,
          not for implicit dependencies based on source files. (See the
          section "Scanner Objects" below, for information about creating
          Scanner objects.)

   source_scanner
          A Scanner object that will be invoked to find implicit
          dependencies in any source files used to build this target file.
          This is where you would specify a scanner to find things like
          #include lines in source files. The pre-built DirScanner Scanner
          object may be used to indicate that this Builder should scan
          directory trees for on-disk changes to files that scons does not
          know about from other Builder or function calls. (See the
          section "Scanner Objects" below, for information about creating
          your own Scanner objects.)

   target_factory
          A factory function that the Builder will use to turn any targets
          specified as strings into SCons Nodes. By default, SCons assumes
          that all targets are files. Other useful target_factory values
          include Dir, for when a Builder creates a directory target, and
          Entry, for when a Builder can create either a file or directory
          target.

          Example:

MakeDirectoryBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, target_factory=Dir)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'MakeDirectory':MakeDirectoryBuilder})
env.MakeDirectory('new_directory', [])

          Note that the call to the MakeDirectory Builder needs to specify
          an empty source list to make the string represent the builder's
          target; without that, it would assume the argument is the
          source, and would try to deduce the target name from it, which
          in the absence of an automatically-added prefix or suffix would
          lead to a matching target and source name and a circular
          dependency.

   source_factory
          A factory function that the Builder will use to turn any sources
          specified as strings into SCons Nodes. By default, SCons assumes
          that all source are files. Other useful source_factory values
          include Dir, for when a Builder uses a directory as a source,
          and Entry, for when a Builder can use files or directories (or
          both) as sources.

          Example:

CollectBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, source_factory=Entry)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'Collect':CollectBuilder})
env.Collect('archive', ['directory_name', 'file_name'])

   emitter
          A function or list of functions to manipulate the target and
          source lists before dependencies are established and the
          target(s) are actually built. emitter can also be a string
          containing a construction variable to expand to an emitter
          function or list of functions, or a dictionary mapping source
          file suffixes to emitter functions. (Only the suffix of the
          first source file is used to select the actual emitter function
          from an emitter dictionary.)

          An emitter function takes three arguments: source - a list of
          source nodes, target - a list of target nodes, env - the
          construction environment. An emitter must return a tuple
          containing two lists, the list of targets to be built by this
          builder, and the list of sources for this builder.

          Example:

def e(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['foo.foo'], source + ['foo.src'])

# Simple association of an emitter function with a Builder.
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = e)

def e2(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['bar.foo'], source + ['bar.src'])

# Simple association of a list of emitter functions with a Builder.
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = [e, e2])

# Calling an emitter function through a construction variable.
env = Environment(MY_EMITTER = e)
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = '$MY_EMITTER')

# Calling a list of emitter functions through a construction variable.
env = Environment(EMITTER_LIST = [e, e2])
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = '$EMITTER_LIST')

# Associating multiple emitters with different file
# suffixes using a dictionary.
def e_suf1(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['another_target_file'], source)
def e_suf2(target, source, env):
    return (target, source + ['another_source_file'])
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = {'.suf1' : e_suf1,
                       '.suf2' : e_suf2})

   multi
          Specifies whether this builder is allowed to be called multiple
          times for the same target file(s). The default is 0, which means
          the builder can not be called multiple times for the same target
          file(s). Calling a builder multiple times for the same target
          simply adds additional source files to the target; it is not
          allowed to change the environment associated with the target,
          specify additional environment overrides, or associate a
          different builder with the target.

   env
          A construction environment that can be used to fetch source code
          using this Builder. (Note that this environment is not used for
          normal builds of normal target files, which use the environment
          that was used to call the Builder for the target file.)

   generator
          A function that returns a list of actions that will be executed
          to build the target(s) from the source(s). The returned
          action(s) may be an Action object, or anything that can be
          converted into an Action object (see the next section).

          The generator function takes four arguments: source - a list of
          source nodes, target - a list of target nodes, env - the
          construction environment, for_signature - a Boolean value that
          specifies whether the generator is being called for generating a
          build signature (as opposed to actually executing the command).
          Example:

def g(source, target, env, for_signature):
    return [["gcc", "-c", "-o"] + target + source]

b = Builder(generator=g)

          The generator and action arguments must not both be used for the
          same Builder.

   src_builder
          Specifies a builder to use when a source file name suffix does
          not match any of the suffixes of the builder. Using this
          argument produces a multi-stage builder.

   single_source
          Specifies that this builder expects exactly one source file per
          call. Giving more than one source file without target files
          results in implicitly calling the builder multiple times (once
          for each source given). Giving multiple source files together
          with target files results in a UserError exception.

   The generator and action arguments must not both be used for the same
   Builder.

   source_ext_match
          When the specified action argument is a dictionary, the default
          behavior when a builder is passed multiple source files is to
          make sure that the extensions of all the source files match. If
          it is legal for this builder to be called with a list of source
          files with different extensions, this check can be suppressed by
          setting source_ext_match to None or some other non-true value.
          When source_ext_match is disable, scons will use the suffix of
          the first specified source file to select the appropriate action
          from the action dictionary.

          In the following example, the setting of source_ext_match
          prevents scons from exiting with an error due to the mismatched
          suffixes of foo.in and foo.extra.

b = Builder(action={'.in' : 'build $SOURCES > $TARGET'},
            source_ext_match = None)

env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'MyBuild':b})
env.MyBuild('foo.out', ['foo.in', 'foo.extra'])

   env
          A construction environment that can be used to fetch source code
          using this Builder. (Note that this environment is not used for
          normal builds of normal target files, which use the environment
          that was used to call the Builder for the target file.)

b = Builder(action="build < $SOURCE > $TARGET")
env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('foo.out', 'foo.in', my_arg = 'xyzzy')

   chdir
          A directory from which scons will execute the action(s)
          specified for this Builder. If the chdir argument is a string or
          a directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory.
          If the chdir is not a string or Node and is non-zero, then scons
          will change to the target file's directory.

          Note that scons will not automatically modify its expansion of
          construction variables like $TARGET and $SOURCE when using the
          chdir keyword argument--that is, the expanded file names will
          still be relative to the top-level SConstruct directory, and
          consequently incorrect relative to the chdir directory. Builders
          created using chdir keyword argument, will need to use
          construction variable expansions like ${TARGET.file} and
          ${SOURCE.file} to use just the filename portion of the targets
          and source.

b = Builder(action="build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}",
            chdir=1)
env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in')

          WARNING: Python only keeps one current directory location for
          all of the threads. This means that use of the chdir argument
          will not work with the SCons -j option, because individual
          worker threads spawned by SCons interfere with each other when
          they start changing directory.

   Any additional keyword arguments supplied when a Builder object is
   created (that is, when the Builder() function is called) will be set in
   the executing construction environment when the Builder object is
   called. The canonical example here would be to set a construction
   variable to the repository of a source code system.

   Any additional keyword arguments supplied when a Builder object is
   called will only be associated with the target created by that
   particular Builder call (and any other files built as a result of the
   call).

   These extra keyword arguments are passed to the following functions:
   command generator functions, function Actions, and emitter functions.

Action Objects

   The Builder() function will turn its action keyword argument into an
   appropriate internal Action object. You can also explicitly create
   Action objects using the Action() global function, which can then be
   passed to the Builder() function. This can be used to configure an
   Action object more flexibly, or it may simply be more efficient than
   letting each separate Builder object create a separate Action when
   multiple Builder objects need to do the same thing.

   The Action() global function returns an appropriate object for the
   action represented by the type of the first argument:

   Action
          If the first argument is already an Action object, the object is
          simply returned.

   String
          If the first argument is a string, a command-line Action is
          returned. Note that the command-line string may be preceded by
          an @ (at-sign) to suppress printing of the specified command
          line, or by a - (hyphen) to ignore the exit status from the
          specified command:

Action('$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES')

# Doesn't print the line being executed.
Action('@build $TARGET $SOURCES')

# Ignores return value
Action('-build $TARGET $SOURCES')

   List
          If the first argument is a list, then a list of Action objects
          is returned. An Action object is created as necessary for each
          element in the list. If an element within the list is itself a
          list, the internal list is the command and arguments to be
          executed via the command line. This allows white space to be
          enclosed in an argument by defining a command in a list within a
          list:

Action([['cc', '-c', '-DWHITE SPACE', '-o', '$TARGET', '$SOURCES']])

   Function
          If the first argument is a Python function, a function Action is
          returned. The Python function must take three keyword arguments,
          target (a Node object representing the target file), source (a
          Node object representing the source file) and env (the
          construction environment used for building the target file). The
          target and source arguments may be lists of Node objects if
          there is more than one target file or source file. The actual
          target and source file name(s) may be retrieved from their Node
          objects via the built-in Python str function:

target_file_name = str(target)
source_file_names = [str(x) for x in source]

          The function should return 0 or None to indicate a successful
          build of the target file(s). The function may raise an exception
          or return a non-zero exit status to indicate an unsuccessful
          build.

def build_it(target = None, source = None, env = None):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

a = Action(build_it)

          If the action argument is not one of the above, None is
          returned.

   The second argument is optional and is used to define the output which
   is printed when the Action is actually performed. In the absence of
   this parameter, or if it's an empty string, a default output depending
   on the type of the action is used. For example, a command-line action
   will print the executed command. The argument must be either a Python
   function or a string.

   In the first case, it's a function that returns a string to be printed
   to describe the action being executed. The function may also be
   specified by the strfunction= keyword argument. Like a function to
   build a file, this function must take three keyword arguments: target
   (a Node object representing the target file), source (a Node object
   representing the source file) and env (a construction environment). The
   target and source arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is
   more than one target file or source file.

   In the second case, you provide the string itself. The string may also
   be specified by the cmdstr= keyword argument. The string typically
   contains variables, notably $TARGET(S) and $SOURCE(S), or consists of
   just a single variable, which is optionally defined somewhere else.
   SCons itself heavily uses the latter variant.

   Examples:
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

def string_it(target, source, env):
    return "building '%s' from '%s'" % (target[0], source[0])

# Use a positional argument.
f = Action(build_it, string_it)
s = Action(build_it, "building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'")

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
f = Action(build_it, strfunction=string_it)
s = Action(build_it, cmdstr="building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'")

# You can provide a configurable variable.
l = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT')

   The third and succeeding arguments, if present, may either be a
   construction variable or a list of construction variables whose values
   will be included in the signature of the Action when deciding whether a
   target should be rebuilt because the action changed. The variables may
   also be specified by a varlist= keyword parameter; if both are present,
   they are combined. This is necessary whenever you want a target to be
   rebuilt when a specific construction variable changes. This is not
   often needed for a string action, as the expanded variables will
   normally be part of the command line, but may be needed if a Python
   function action uses the value of a construction variable when
   generating the command line.
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the 'XXX' construction variable
    open(target[0], 'w').write(env['XXX'])
    return 0

# Use positional arguments.
a = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT', ['XXX'])

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
a = Action(build_it, varlist=['XXX'])

   The Action global function can be passed the following optional keyword
   arguments to modify the Action object's behavior:

   chdir specifies that scons will execute the action after changing to
   the specified directory. If the chdir argument is a string or a
   directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory. If the
   chdir argument is not a string or Node and is non-zero, then scons will
   change to the target file's directory.

   Note that scons will not automatically modify its expansion of
   construction variables like $TARGET and $SOURCE when using the chdir
   keyword argument--that is, the expanded file names will still be
   relative to the top-level SConstruct directory, and consequently
   incorrect relative to the chdir directory. Builders created using chdir
   keyword argument, will need to use construction variable expansions
   like ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to use just the filename portion
   of the targets and source.
a = Action("build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}",
           chdir=1)

   exitstatfunc specifies a function that is passed the exit status (or
   return value) from the specified action and can return an arbitrary or
   modified value. This can be used, for example, to specify that an
   Action object's return value should be ignored under special conditions
   and SCons should, therefore, consider that the action always suceeds:
def always_succeed(s):
    # Always return 0, which indicates success.
    return 0
a = Action("build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}",
           exitstatfunc=always_succeed)

   batch_key specifies that the Action can create multiple target files by
   processing multiple independent source files simultaneously. (The
   canonical example is "batch compilation" of multiple object files by
   passing multiple source files to a single invocation of a compiler such
   as Microsoft's Visual C / C++ compiler.) If the batch_key argument
   evaluates True and is not a callable object, the configured Action
   object will cause scons to collect all targets built with the Action
   object and configured with the same construction environment into
   single invocations of the Action object's command line or function.
   Command lines will typically want to use the CHANGED_SOURCES
   construction variable (and possibly CHANGED_TARGETS as well) to only
   pass to the command line those sources that have actually changed since
   their targets were built.

   Example:
a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=True)

   The batch_key argument may also be a callable function that returns a
   key that will be used to identify different "batches" of target files
   to be collected for batch building. A batch_key function must accept
   the following arguments:

   action
          The action object.

   env
          The construction environment configured for the target.

   target
          The list of targets for a particular configured action.

   source
          The list of source for a particular configured action.

          The returned key should typically be a tuple of values derived
          from the arguments, using any appropriate logic to decide how
          multiple invocations should be batched. For example, a batch_key
          function may decide to return the value of a specific
          construction variable from the env argument which will cause
          scons to batch-build targets with matching values of that
          variable, or perhaps return the id() of the entire construction
          environment, in which case scons will batch-build all targets
          configured with the same construction environment. Returning
          None indicates that the particular target should not be part of
          any batched build, but instead will be built by a separate
          invocation of action's command or function. Example:

def batch_key(action, env, target, source):
    tdir = target[0].dir
    if tdir.name == 'special':
        # Don't batch-build any target
        # in the special/ subdirectory.
        return None
    return (id(action), id(env), tdir)
a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=batch_key)

Miscellaneous Action Functions

   scons supplies a number of functions that arrange for various common
   file and directory manipulations to be performed. These are similar in
   concept to "tasks" in the Ant build tool, although the implementation
   is slightly different. These functions do not actually perform the
   specified action at the time the function is called, but instead return
   an Action object that can be executed at the appropriate time. (In
   Object-Oriented terminology, these are actually Action Factory
   functions that return Action objects.)

   In practice, there are two natural ways that these Action Functions are
   intended to be used.

   First, if you need to perform the action at the time the SConscript
   file is being read, you can use the Execute global function to do so:
Execute(Touch('file'))

   Second, you can use these functions to supply Actions in a list for use
   by the Command method. This can allow you to perform more complicated
   sequences of file manipulation without relying on platform-specific
   external commands:
env = Environment(TMPBUILD = '/tmp/builddir')
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Mkdir('$TMPBUILD'),
             Copy('$TMPBUILD', '${SOURCE.dir}'),
             "cd $TMPBUILD && make",
             Delete('$TMPBUILD')])

   Chmod(dest, mode)
          Returns an Action object that changes the permissions on the
          specified dest file or directory to the specified mode which can
          be octal or string, similar to the bash command. Examples:

Execute(Chmod('file', 0o755))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'),
             Chmod('$TARGET', 0o755)])

Execute(Chmod('file', "ugo+w"))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'),
             Chmod('$TARGET', "ugo+w")])

   Copy(dest, src)
          Returns an Action object that will copy the src source file or
          directory to the dest destination file or directory. Examples:

Execute(Copy('foo.output', 'foo.input'))

env.Command('bar.out', 'bar.in',
            Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'))

   Delete(entry, [must_exist])
          Returns an Action that deletes the specified entry, which may be
          a file or a directory tree. If a directory is specified, the
          entire directory tree will be removed. If the must_exist flag is
          set, then a Python error will be thrown if the specified entry
          does not exist; the default is must_exist=0, that is, the Action
          will silently do nothing if the entry does not exist. Examples:

Execute(Delete('/tmp/buildroot'))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Delete('${TARGET.dir}'),
             MyBuildAction])

Execute(Delete('file_that_must_exist', must_exist=1))

   Mkdir(dir)
          Returns an Action that creates the specified directory dir .
          Examples:

Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/outputdir'))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Mkdir('/tmp/builddir'),
             Copy('/tmp/builddir/foo.in', '$SOURCE'),
             "cd /tmp/builddir && make",
             Copy('$TARGET', '/tmp/builddir/foo.out')])

   Move(dest, src)
          Returns an Action that moves the specified src file or directory
          to the specified dest file or directory. Examples:

Execute(Move('file.destination', 'file.source'))

env.Command('output_file', 'input_file',
            [MyBuildAction,
             Move('$TARGET', 'file_created_by_MyBuildAction')])

   Touch(file)
          Returns an Action that updates the modification time on the
          specified file. Examples:

Execute(Touch('file_to_be_touched'))

env.Command('marker', 'input_file',
            [MyBuildAction,
             Touch('$TARGET')])

Variable Substitution

   Before executing a command, scons performs construction variable
   interpolation on the string that makes up the command line of the
   builder. Variables are introduced in such strings by a $ prefix.
   Besides regular construction variables, scons provides the following
   special variables for each command execution:

   CHANGED_SOURCES
          The file names of all sources of the build command that have
          changed since the target was last built.

   CHANGED_TARGETS
          The file names of all targets that would be built from sources
          that have changed since the target was last built.

   SOURCE
          The file name of the source of the build command, or the file
          name of the first source if multiple sources are being built.

   SOURCES
          The file names of the sources of the build command.

   TARGET
          The file name of the target being built, or the file name of the
          first target if multiple targets are being built.

   TARGETS
          The file names of all targets being built.

   UNCHANGED_SOURCES
          The file names of all sources of the build command that have not
          changed since the target was last built.

   UNCHANGED_TARGETS
          The file names of all targets that would be built from sources
          that have not changed since the target was last built.

   Note that the above variables are reserved and may not be set in a
   construction environment.

   For example, given the construction variables CC='cc', targets=['foo']
   and sources=['foo.c', 'bar.c']:
action='$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES'

   would produce the command line:
cc -c -o foo foo.c bar.c

   Variable names may be surrounded by curly braces { } to separate the
   name from surrounding characters which are not part of the name. Within
   the curly braces, a variable name may have a Python slice subscript
   appended to select one or more items from a list. In the previous
   example, the string:
${SOURCES[1]}

   would produce:
bar.c

   Additionally, a variable name may have the following special modifiers
   appended within the enclosing curly braces to modify the interpolated
   string:

   base
          The base path of the file name, including the directory path but
          excluding any suffix.

   dir
          The name of the directory in which the file exists.

   file
          The file name, minus any directory portion.

   filebase
          Just the basename of the file, minus any suffix and minus the
          directory.

   suffix
          Just the file suffix.

   abspath
          The absolute path name of the file.

   posix
          The POSIX form of the path, with directories separated by /
          (forward slashes) not backslashes. This is sometimes necessary
          on Windows systems when a path references a file on other
          (POSIX) systems.

   srcpath
          The directory and file name to the source file linked to this
          file through VariantDir(). If this file isn't linked, it just
          returns the directory and filename unchanged.

   srcdir
          The directory containing the source file linked to this file
          through VariantDir(). If this file isn't linked, it just returns
          the directory part of the filename.

   rsrcpath
          The directory and file name to the source file linked to this
          file through VariantDir(). If the file does not exist locally
          but exists in a Repository, the path in the Repository is
          returned. If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
          directory and filename unchanged.

   rsrcdir
          The Repository directory containing the source file linked to
          this file through VariantDir(). If this file isn't linked, it
          just returns the directory part of the filename.

   For example, the specified target will expand as follows for the
   corresponding modifiers:
$TARGET              => sub/dir/file.x
${TARGET.base}       => sub/dir/file
${TARGET.dir}        => sub/dir
${TARGET.file}       => file.x
${TARGET.filebase}   => file
${TARGET.suffix}     => .x
${TARGET.abspath}    => /top/dir/sub/dir/file.x

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='sub/dir')
$SOURCE              => sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.srcpath}    => src/file.x
${SOURCE.srcdir}     => src

Repository('/usr/repository')
$SOURCE              => sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcpath}   => /usr/repository/src/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcdir}    => /usr/repository/src

   Note that curly braces braces may also be used to enclose arbitrary
   Python code to be evaluated. (In fact, this is how the above modifiers
   are substituted, they are simply attributes of the Python objects that
   represent TARGET, SOURCES, etc.) See the section "Python Code
   Substitution" below, for more thorough examples of how this can be
   used.

   Lastly, a variable name may be a callable Python function associated
   with a construction variable in the environment. The function should
   accept four arguments:

   target
          a list of target nodes

   source
          a list of source nodes

   env
          the construction environment

   for_signature
          a Boolean value that specifies whether the function is being
          called for generating a build signature.

   SCons will insert whatever the called function returns into the
   expanded string:
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return "bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="$FOO baz")

   You can use this feature to pass arguments to a Python function by
   creating a callable class that stores one or more arguments in an
   object, and then uses them when the __call__() method is called. Note
   that in this case, the entire variable expansion must be enclosed by
   curly braces so that the arguments will be associated with the
   instantiation of the class:
class foo(object):
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
        return self.arg + " bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "my argument bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="${FOO('my argument')} baz")

   The special pseudo-variables $( and $) may be used to surround parts of
   a command line that may change without causing a rebuild--that is,
   which are not included in the signature of target files built with this
   command. All text between $( and $) will be removed from the command
   line before it is added to file signatures, and the $( and $) will be
   removed before the command is executed. For example, the command line:
echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $). > $TARGET

   would execute the command:
echo Last build occurred $TODAY. > $TARGET

   but the command signature added to any target files would be:
echo Last build occurred  . > $TARGET

Python Code Substitution

   Any Python code within curly braces { } and introduced by the variable
   prefix $ gets evaluated by the Python eval statement, with the Python
   globals set to the current environment's set of construction variables.
   So in the following case:
env['COND'] = 0
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
    '''echo ${COND==1 and 'FOO' or 'BAR'} > $TARGET''')

   the command executed will be either
echo FOO > foo.out

   or
echo BAR > foo.out

   according to the current value of env['COND'] when the command is
   executed. The evaluation takes place when the target is being built,
   not when the SConscript is being read. So if env['COND'] is changed
   later in the SConscript, the final value will be used.

   Here's a more interesting example. Note that all of COND, FOO, and BAR
   are construction variables, and their values are substituted into the
   final command. FOO is a list, so its elements are interpolated
   separated by spaces.
env=Environment()
env['COND'] = 0
env['FOO'] = ['foo1', 'foo2']
env['BAR'] = 'barbar'
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
    'echo ${COND==1 and FOO or BAR} > $TARGET')

# Will execute this:
#  echo foo1 foo2 > foo.out

   SCons uses the following rules when converting construction variables
   into command lines:

   String
          When the value is a string it is interpreted as a space
          delimited list of command line arguments.

   List
          When the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command
          line arguments. Each element of the list is converted to a
          string.

   Other
          Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string
          and interpreted as a single command line argument.

   Newline
          Newline characters (\n) delimit lines. The newline parsing is
          done after all other parsing, so it is not possible for
          arguments (e.g. file names) to contain embedded newline
          characters. This limitation will likely go away in a future
          version of SCons.

Scanner Objects

   You can use the Scanner function to define objects to scan new file
   types for implicit dependencies. The Scanner function accepts the
   following arguments:

   function
          This can be either: 1) a Python function that will process the
          Node (file) and return a list of File Nodes representing the
          implicit dependencies (file names) found in the contents; or: 2)
          a dictionary that maps keys (typically the file suffix, but see
          below for more discussion) to other Scanners that should be
          called.

          If the argument is actually a Python function, the function must
          take three or four arguments:

          def scanner_function(node, env, path):

          def scanner_function(node, env, path, arg=None):

          The node argument is the internal SCons node representing the
          file. Use str(node) to fetch the name of the file, and
          node.get_contents() to fetch contents of the file. Note that the
          file is not guaranteed to exist before the scanner is called, so
          the scanner function should check that if there's any chance
          that the scanned file might not exist (for example, if it's
          built from other files).

          The env argument is the construction environment for the scan.
          Fetch values from it using the env.Dictionary() method or using
          the key lookup operator directly on the construction
          environment.

          The path argument is a tuple (or list) of directories that can
          be searched for files. This will usually be the tuple returned
          by the path_function argument (see below).

          The arg argument is the argument supplied when the scanner was
          created, if any.

   name
          The name of the Scanner. This is mainly used to identify the
          Scanner internally.

   argument
          An optional argument that, if specified, will be passed to the
          scanner function (described above) and the path function
          (specified below).

   skeys
          An optional list that can be used to determine which scanner
          should be used for a given Node. In the usual case of scanning
          for file names, this argument will be a list of suffixes for the
          different file types that this Scanner knows how to scan. If the
          argument is a string, then it will be expanded into a list by
          the current environment.

   path_function
          A Python function that takes four or five arguments: a
          construction environment, a Node for the directory containing
          the SConscript file in which the first target was defined, a
          list of target nodes, a list of source nodes, and an optional
          argument supplied when the scanner was created. The
          path_function returns a tuple of directories that can be
          searched for files to be returned by this Scanner object. (Note
          that the FindPathDirs() function can be used to return a
          ready-made path_function for a given construction variable name,
          instead of having to write your own function from scratch.)

   node_class
          The class of Node that should be returned by this Scanner
          object. Any strings or other objects returned by the scanner
          function that are not of this class will be run through the
          node_factory function.

   node_factory
          A Python function that will take a string or other object and
          turn it into the appropriate class of Node to be returned by
          this Scanner object.

   scan_check
          An optional Python function that takes two arguments, a Node
          (file) and a construction environment, and returns whether the
          Node should, in fact, be scanned for dependencies. This check
          can be used to eliminate unnecessary calls to the scanner
          function when, for example, the underlying file represented by a
          Node does not yet exist.

   recursive
          An optional flag that specifies whether this scanner should be
          re-invoked on the dependency files returned by the scanner. When
          this flag is not set, the Node subsystem will only invoke the
          scanner on the file being scanned, and not (for example) also on
          the files specified by the #include lines in the file being
          scanned. recursive may be a callable function, in which case it
          will be called with a list of Nodes found and should return a
          list of Nodes that should be scanned recursively; this can be
          used to select a specific subset of Nodes for additional
          scanning.

   Note that scons has a global SourceFileScanner object that is used by
   the Object(), SharedObject(), and StaticObject() builders to decide
   which scanner should be used for different file extensions. You can
   using the SourceFileScanner.add_scanner() method to add your own
   Scanner object to the scons infrastructure that builds target programs
   or libraries from a list of source files of different types:
def xyz_scan(node, env, path):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    # Scan the contents and return the included files.

XYZScanner = Scanner(xyz_scan)

SourceFileScanner.add_scanner('.xyz', XYZScanner)

env.Program('my_prog', ['file1.c', 'file2.f', 'file3.xyz'])

SYSTEM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR

   SCons and its configuration files are very portable, due largely to its
   implementation in Python. There are, however, a few portability issues
   waiting to trap the unwary.

.C file suffix

   SCons handles the upper-case .C file suffix differently, depending on
   the capabilities of the underlying system. On a case-sensitive system
   such as Linux or UNIX, SCons treats a file with a .C suffix as a C++
   source file. On a case-insensitive system such as Windows, SCons treats
   a file with a .C suffix as a C source file.

.F file suffix

   SCons handles the upper-case .F file suffix differently, depending on
   the capabilities of the underlying system. On a case-sensitive system
   such as Linux or UNIX, SCons treats a file with a .F suffix as a
   Fortran source file that is to be first run through the standard C
   preprocessor. On a case-insensitive system such as Windows, SCons
   treats a file with a .F suffix as a Fortran source file that should not
   be run through the C preprocessor.

Windows: Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs. Windows Pythons

   Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities that let users work on a
   Windows system using a more POSIX-like environment. The Cygwin tools,
   including Cygwin Python, do this, in part, by sharing an ability to
   interpret UNIX-like path names. For example, the Cygwin tools will
   internally translate a Cygwin path name like /cygdrive/c/mydir to an
   equivalent Windows pathname of C:/mydir (equivalent to C:\mydir).

   Versions of Python that are built for native Windows execution, such as
   the python.org and ActiveState versions, do not have the Cygwin path
   name semantics. This means that using a native Windows version of
   Python to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools (such as gcc,
   bison, and flex) may yield unpredictable results. "Mixing and matching"
   in this way can be made to work, but it requires careful attention to
   the use of path names in your SConscript files.

   In practice, users can sidestep the issue by adopting the following
   rules: When using gcc, use the Cygwin-supplied Python interpreter to
   run SCons; when using Microsoft Visual C/C++ (or some other Windows
   compiler) use the python.org or ActiveState version of Python to run
   SCons.

Windows: scons.bat file

   On Windows systems, SCons is executed via a wrapper scons.bat file.
   This has (at least) two ramifications:

   First, Windows command-line users that want to use variable assignment
   on the command line may have to put double quotes around the
   assignments:
scons "FOO=BAR" "BAZ=BLEH"

   Second, the Cygwin shell does not recognize this file as being the same
   as an scons command issued at the command-line prompt. You can work
   around this either by executing scons.bat from the Cygwin command line,
   or by creating a wrapper shell script named scons .

MinGW

   The MinGW bin directory must be in your PATH environment variable or
   the PATH variable under the ENV construction variable for SCons to
   detect and use the MinGW tools. When running under the native Windows
   Python interpreter, SCons will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin
   tools, if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin
   directories in the PATH variable. If you have both MSVC and MinGW
   installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC, then you must
   explicitly tell SCons to use MinGW by passing
tools=['mingw']

   to the Environment() function, because SCons will prefer the MSVC tools
   over the MinGW tools.

EXAMPLES

   To help you get started using SCons, this section contains a brief
   overview of some common tasks.

Basic Compilation From a Single Source File

env = Environment()
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

   Note: Build the file by specifying the target as an argument ("scons
   foo" or "scons foo.exe"). or by specifying a dot ("scons .").

Basic Compilation From Multiple Source Files

env = Environment()
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = Split('f1.c f2.c f3.c'))

Setting a Compilation Flag

env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

Search The Local Directory For .h Files

   Note: You do not need to set CCFLAGS to specify -I options by hand.
   SCons will construct the right -I options from CPPPATH.
env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

Search Multiple Directories For .h Files

env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['include1', 'include2'])
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

Building a Static Library

env = Environment()
env.StaticLibrary(target = 'foo', source = Split('l1.c l2.c'))
env.StaticLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['l3.c', 'l4.c'])

Building a Shared Library

env = Environment()
env.SharedLibrary(target = 'foo', source = ['l5.c', 'l6.c'])
env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar', source = Split('l7.c l8.c'))

Linking a Local Library Into a Program

env = Environment(LIBS = 'mylib', LIBPATH = ['.'])
env.Library(target = 'mylib', source = Split('l1.c l2.c'))
env.Program(target = 'prog', source = ['p1.c', 'p2.c'])

Defining Your Own Builder Object

   Notice that when you invoke the Builder, you can leave off the target
   file suffix, and SCons will add it automatically.
bld = Builder(action = 'pdftex < $SOURCES > $TARGET'
              suffix = '.pdf',
              src_suffix = '.tex')
env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'PDFBuilder' : bld})
env.PDFBuilder(target = 'foo.pdf', source = 'foo.tex')

# The following creates "bar.pdf" from "bar.tex"
env.PDFBuilder(target = 'bar', source = 'bar')

   Note also that the above initialization overwrites the default Builder
   objects, so the Environment created above can not be used call Builders
   like env.Program(), env.Object(), env.StaticLibrary(), etc.

Adding Your Own Builder Object to an Environment

bld = Builder(action = 'pdftex < $SOURCES > $TARGET'
              suffix = '.pdf',
              src_suffix = '.tex')
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'PDFBuilder' : bld})
env.PDFBuilder(target = 'foo.pdf', source = 'foo.tex')
env.Program(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.c')

   You also can use other Pythonic techniques to add to the BUILDERS
   construction variable, such as:
env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS]['PDFBuilder'] = bld

Defining Your Own Scanner Object

   The following example shows adding an extremely simple scanner (the
   kfile_scan() function) that doesn't use a search path at all and simply
   returns the file names present on any include lines in the scanned
   file. This would implicitly assume that all included files live in the
   top-level directory:
import re

include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    includes = include_re.findall(contents)
    return env.File(includes)

kscan = Scanner(name = 'kfile',
                function = kfile_scan,
                argument = None,
                skeys = ['.k'])

scanners = DefaultEnvironment()['SCANNERS']
scanners.append(kscan)
env = Environment(SCANNERS=scanners)

env.Command('foo', 'foo.k', 'kprocess < $SOURCES > $TARGET')

bar_in = File('bar.in')
env.Command('bar', bar_in, 'kprocess $SOURCES > $TARGET')
bar_in.target_scanner = kscan

   It is important to note that you have to return a list of File nodes
   from the scan function, simple strings for the file names won't do. As
   in the examples we are showing here, you can use the File() function of
   your current Environment in order to create nodes on the fly from a
   sequence of file names with relative paths.

   Here is a similar but more complete example that adds a scanner which
   searches a path of directories (specified as the MYPATH construction
   variable) for files that actually exist:
import re
import os
include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    includes = include_re.findall(contents)
    if includes == []:
        return []
    results = []
    for inc in includes:
        for dir in path:
            file = str(dir) + os.sep + inc
            if os.path.exists(file):
                results.append(file)
                break
    return env.File(results)

scanner = Scanner(name='myscanner',
                  function=my_scan,
                  argument=None,
                  skeys=['.x'],
                  path_function=FindPathDirs('MYPATH')
                 )

scanners = DefaultEnvironment()['SCANNERS']
scanners.append(scanner)
env = Environment(SCANNERS=scanners, MYPATH=['incs'])

env.Command('foo', 'foo.x', 'xprocess < $SOURCES > $TARGET')

   The FindPathDirs() function used in the previous example returns a
   function (actually a callable Python object) that will return a list of
   directories specified in the $MYPATH construction variable. It lets
   SCons detect the file incs/foo.inc, even if foo.x contains the line
   include foo.inc only. If you need to customize how the search path is
   derived, you would provide your own path_function argument when
   creating the Scanner object, as follows:
# MYPATH is a list of directories to search for files in
def pf(env, dir, target, source, arg):
    top_dir = Dir('#').abspath
    results = []
    if 'MYPATH' in env:
        for p in env['MYPATH']:
            results.append(top_dir + os.sep + p)
    return results

scanner = Scanner(name='myscanner',
                  function=my_scan,
                  argument=None,
                  skeys=['.x'],
                  path_function=pf
                 )

Creating a Hierarchical Build

   Notice that the file names specified in a subdirectory's SConscript
   file are relative to that subdirectory.
SConstruct:

    env = Environment()
    env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

    SConscript('sub/SConscript')

sub/SConscript:

    env = Environment()
    # Builds sub/foo from sub/foo.c
    env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

    SConscript('dir/SConscript')

sub/dir/SConscript:

    env = Environment()
    # Builds sub/dir/foo from sub/dir/foo.c
    env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

Sharing Variables Between SConscript Files

   You must explicitly Export() and Import() variables that you want to
   share between SConscript files.
SConstruct:

    env = Environment()
    env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

    Export("env")
    SConscript('subdirectory/SConscript')

subdirectory/SConscript:

    Import("env")
    env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

Building Multiple Variants From the Same Source

   Use the variant_dir keyword argument to the SConscript function to
   establish one or more separate variant build directory trees for a
   given source directory:
SConstruct:

    cppdefines = ['FOO']
    Export("cppdefines")
    SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='foo')

    cppdefines = ['BAR']
    Export("cppdefines")
    SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='bar')

src/SConscript:

    Import("cppdefines")
    env = Environment(CPPDEFINES = cppdefines)
    env.Program(target = 'src', source = 'src.c')

   Note the use of the Export() method to set the "cppdefines" variable to
   a different value each time we call the SConscript function.

Hierarchical Build of Two Libraries Linked With a Program

SConstruct:

    env = Environment(LIBPATH=['#libA', '#libB'])
    Export('env')
    SConscript('libA/SConscript')
    SConscript('libB/SConscript')
    SConscript('Main/SConscript')

libA/SConscript:

    Import('env')
    env.Library('a', Split('a1.c a2.c a3.c'))

libB/SConscript:

    Import('env')
    env.Library('b', Split('b1.c b2.c b3.c'))

Main/SConscript:

    Import('env')
    e = env.Clone(LIBS=['a', 'b'])
    e.Program('foo', Split('m1.c m2.c m3.c'))

   The '#' in the LIBPATH directories specify that they're relative to the
   top-level directory, so they don't turn into "Main/libA" when they're
   used in Main/SConscript.

   Specifying only 'a' and 'b' for the library names allows SCons to
   append the appropriate library prefix and suffix for the current
   platform (for example, 'liba.a' on POSIX systems, 'a.lib' on Windows).

Customizing construction variables from the command line.

   The following would allow the C compiler to be specified on the command
   line or in the file custom.py.
vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add('CC', 'The C compiler.')
env = Environment(variables=vars)
Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

   The user could specify the C compiler on the command line:
scons "CC=my_cc"

   or in the custom.py file:
CC = 'my_cc'

   or get documentation on the options:
$ scons -h

CC: The C compiler.
    default: None
    actual: cc


Using Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled headers

   Since windows.h includes everything and the kitchen sink, it can take
   quite some time to compile it over and over again for a bunch of object
   files, so Microsoft provides a mechanism to compile a set of headers
   once and then include the previously compiled headers in any object
   file. This technology is called precompiled headers. The general recipe
   is to create a file named "StdAfx.cpp" that includes a single header
   named "StdAfx.h", and then include every header you want to precompile
   in "StdAfx.h", and finally include "StdAfx.h" as the first header in
   all the source files you are compiling to object files. For example:

   StdAfx.h:
#include <windows.h>
#include <my_big_header.h>

   StdAfx.cpp:
#include <StdAfx.h>

   Foo.cpp:
#include <StdAfx.h>

/* do some stuff */

   Bar.cpp:
#include <StdAfx.h>

/* do some other stuff */

   SConstruct:
env=Environment()
env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'
env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]
env.Program('MyApp', ['Foo.cpp', 'Bar.cpp'])

   For more information see the document for the PCH builder, and the PCH
   and PCHSTOP construction variables. To learn about the details of
   precompiled headers consult the MSDN documentation for /Yc, /Yu, and
   /Yp.

Using Microsoft Visual C++ external debugging information

   Since including debugging information in programs and shared libraries
   can cause their size to increase significantly, Microsoft provides a
   mechanism for including the debugging information in an external file
   called a PDB file. SCons supports PDB files through the PDB
   construction variable.

   SConstruct:
env=Environment()
env['PDB'] = 'MyApp.pdb'
env.Program('MyApp', ['Foo.cpp', 'Bar.cpp'])

   For more information see the document for the PDB construction
   variable.

ENVIRONMENT

   In general, scons is not controlled by environment variables set in the
   shell used to invoke it, leaving it up to the SConscript file author to
   import those if desired. However the following variables are imported
   by scons itself if set:

   SCONS_LIB_DIR
          Specifies the directory that contains the scons Python module
          directory (for example, /home/aroach/scons-src-0.01/src/engine).

   SCONSFLAGS
          A string of options that will be used by scons in addition to
          those passed on the command line.

   SCONS_CACHE_MSVC_CONFIG
          (Windows only). If set, save the shell environment variables
          generated when setting up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
          (and/or Build Tools) to a file to give these settings, which are
          expensive to generate, persistence across scons invocations. Use
          of this option is primarily intended to aid performance in
          tightly controlled Continuous Integration setups.

          If set to a True-like value ("1", "true" or "True") will cache
          to a file named .scons_msvc_cache in the user's home directory.
          If set to a pathname, will use that pathname for the cache.

          Note: use this cache with caution as it might be somewhat
          fragile: while each major toolset version (e.g. Visual Studio
          2017 vs 2019) and architecture pair will get separate cache
          entries, if toolset updates cause a change to settings within a
          given release series, scons will not detect the change and will
          reuse old settings. Remove the cache file in case of problems
          with this. scons will ignore failures reading or writing the
          file and will silently revert to non-cached behavior in such
          cases.

          Since scons 3.1.
