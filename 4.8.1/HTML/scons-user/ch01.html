  This chapter will take you through the basic steps
  of installing <span class="application">SCons</span> so you can use it for your projects.
  Before that, however, this chapter will also describe the basic steps
  involved in installing <span class="application">Python</span> on your system,
  in case that is necessary.
  Fortunately, both <span class="application">SCons</span> and <span class="application">Python</span>
  are easy to install on almost any system,
  and <span class="application">Python</span> already comes installed on many systems.

  </p><div class="section" title="1.1. Installing Python"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sect-install-python"></a>1.1. Installing Python</h2></div></div></div><p>
    Because <span class="application">SCons</span> is written in the <span class="application">Python</span> programming language,
    you need to have a <span class="application">Python</span> interpreter available on your system
    to use <span class="application">SCons</span>.
    Before you try to install <span class="application">Python</span>,
    check to see if <span class="application">Python</span> is already
    available on your system  by typing
    <strong class="userinput"><code>python -V</code></strong>
    (capital 'V')
    or
    <strong class="userinput"><code>python --version</code></strong>
    at your system's command-line prompt.
    For Linux/Unix/MacOS/BSD type systems this looks like:
    </p><pre class="screen">
$ <strong class="userinput"><code>python -V</code></strong>
Python 3.9.15
    </pre><p>
    If you get a version like 2.7.x, you may need to try using the
    name <span class="command"><strong>python3</strong></span> - current <span class="application">SCons</span> no longer
    works with <span class="application">Python</span> 2.
    </p><p>
    Note to Windows users: there are a number of different ways <span class="application">Python</span>
    can be installed or invoked on Windows, it is beyond the scope
    of this guide to unravel all of them. Some have an additional
    program called the <em class="firstterm">Python launcher</em> (described,
    somewhat technically, in
    <a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/" target="_top">PEP 397</a>):
    try using the command name <span class="command"><strong>py</strong></span> instead of
    <span class="command"><strong>python</strong></span>, if that is not available drop
    back to trying <span class="command"><strong>python</strong></span>
    </p><pre class="screen">
C:\&gt;<strong class="userinput"><code>py -V</code></strong>
Python 3.9.15
    </pre><p>
    If <span class="application">Python</span> is not installed on your system,
    or is not findable in the current search path,
    you will see an error message
    stating something like <code class="computeroutput">"command not found"</code>
    (on UNIX or Linux)
    or <code class="computeroutput">"'python' is not recognized as an internal
    or external command, operable progam or batch file"</code>
    (on Windows <span class="command"><strong>cmd</strong></span>).
    In that case, you need to either install <span class="application">Python</span>
    or fix the search path
    before you can install <span class="application">SCons</span>.
    </p><p>
    The link for downloading <span class="application">Python</span> installers (Windows and Mac)
    from the project's own website is:
    <a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/download" target="_top">https://www.python.org/download</a>.
    There are useful system-specific entries on setup and
    usage to be found at:
    <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.python.org/3/using" target="_top">https://docs.python.org/3/using</a>
    </p><p>
    For Linux systems, <span class="application">Python</span> is
    almost certainly available as a supported package, probably
    installed by default; this is often preferred over installing
    by other means as the system package will be built with
    carefully chosen optimizations, and will be kept up to date
    with bug fixes and security patches. In fact, the <span class="application">Python</span>
    project itself does not build installers for Linux for this reason.
    Many such systems have separate packages for
    <span class="application">Python</span> 2 and <span class="application">Python</span> 3 - make sure the <span class="application">Python</span> 3 package is
    installed, as the latest <span class="application">SCons</span> requires it.
    Building from source may still be a
    useful option if you need a specific version that is not offered by
    the distribution you are using.
    </p><p>
    Recent versions of the Mac no longer come with <span class="application">Python</span>
    pre-installed; older versions came with a rather out of date
    version (based on <span class="application">Python</span> 2.7) which is insufficient to run
    current <span class="application">SCons</span>.
    The python.org installer can be used on the Mac, but there are
    also other sources such as MacPorts and Homebrew.
    The Anaconda installation also comes with a bundled <span class="application">Python</span>.
    </p><p>
    Windows has even more choices.  The Python.org installer is
    a traditional <code class="filename">.exe</code> style;
    the same software is also released as a Windows application through
    the Microsoft Store.  Several alternative builds also exist
    such as Chocolatey and ActiveState, and, again,
    a version of Python comes with Anaconda.
    </p><p>
    <span class="application">SCons</span> will work with <span class="application">Python</span> 3.6 or later.
    If you need to install <span class="application">Python</span> and have a choice,
    we recommend using the most recent <span class="application">Python</span> version available.
    Newer <span class="application">Python</span> versions have significant improvements
    that help speed up the performance of <span class="application">SCons</span>.
