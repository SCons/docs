    <span class="application">SCons</span> would not exist without a lot of help
    from a lot of people,
    many of whom may not even be aware
    that they helped or served as inspiration.
    So in no particular order,
    and at the risk of leaving out someone:

    </p><p>

    First and foremost,
    <span class="application">SCons</span> owes a tremendous debt to Bob Sidebotham,
    the original author of the classic Perl-based <span class="application">Cons</span> tool
    which Bob first released to the world back around 1996.
    Bob's work on Cons classic provided the underlying architecture
    and model of specifying a build configuration
    using a real scripting language.
    My real-world experience working on Cons
    informed many of the design decisions in SCons,
    including the improved parallel build support,
    making Builder objects easily definable by users,
    and separating the build engine from the wrapping interface.

    </p><p>

    Greg Wilson was instrumental in getting
    <span class="application">SCons</span> started as a real project
    when he initiated the Software Carpentry design
    competition in February 2000.
    Without that nudge,
    marrying the advantages of the Cons classic
    architecture with the readability of Python
    might have just stayed no more than a nice idea.

    </p><p>

    The entire <span class="application">SCons</span> team have been
    absolutely wonderful to work with,
    and <span class="application">SCons</span> would be nowhere near as useful a
    tool without the energy, enthusiasm
    and time people have contributed over the past few years.
    The "core team"
    of Chad Austin, Anthony Roach,
    Bill Deegan, Charles Crain, Steve Leblanc, Greg Noel,
    Gary Oberbrunner, Greg Spencer and Christoph Wiedemann
    have been great about reviewing my (and other) changes
    and catching problems before they get in the code base.
    Of particular technical note:
    Anthony's outstanding and innovative work on the tasking engine
    has given <span class="application">SCons</span> a vastly superior parallel build model;
    Charles has been the master of the crucial Node infrastructure;
    Christoph's work on the Configure infrastructure
    has added crucial Autoconf-like functionality;
    and Greg has provided excellent support
    for Microsoft Visual Studio.

    </p><p>

    Special thanks to David Snopek for contributing
    his underlying "Autoscons" code that formed
    the basis of Christoph's work with the Configure functionality.
    David was extremely generous in making
    this code available to <span class="application">SCons</span>,
    given that he initially released it under the GPL
    and <span class="application">SCons</span> is released under a less-restrictive MIT-style license.

    </p><p>

    Thanks to Peter Miller
    for his splendid change management system, <span class="application">Aegis</span>,
    which has provided the <span class="application">SCons</span> project
    with a robust development methodology from day one,
    and which showed me how you could
    integrate incremental regression tests into
    a practical development cycle
    (years before eXtreme Programming arrived on the scene).

    </p><p>

    And last, thanks to Guido van Rossum
    for his elegant scripting language,
    which is the basis not only for the <span class="application">SCons</span> implementation,
    but for the interface itself.
