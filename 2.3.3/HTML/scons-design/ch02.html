   As a next-generation build tool,
   <span class="application">SCons</span> should fundamentally
   improve on its predecessors.
   Rather than simply being driven by trying to
   <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be like previous tools,
   <span class="application">SCons</span> aims to satisfy the following goals:

 </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Practicality</code></span></dt><dd><p>

     The <span class="application">SCons</span> design emphasizes
     an implementable feature set
     that lets users get practical, useful work done.
     <span class="application">SCons</span> is helped in this regard by its roots in <span class="application">Cons</span>,
     which has had its feature set honed by
     several years of input
     from a dedicated band of users.

    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Portability</code></span></dt><dd><p>

     <span class="application">SCons</span> is intended as a portable build tool,
     able to handle software construction tasks
     on a variety of operating systems.
     It should be possible (although not mandatory)
     to use <span class="application">SCons</span> so that the same configuration file
     builds the same software correctly on,
     for example, both Linux and Windows NT.
     Consequently, <span class="application">SCons</span> should hide from users
     operating-system-dependent details
     such as filename extensions
     (for example, <code class="filename">.o</code>
     vs. <code class="filename">.obj</code>).

     

     

    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Usability</code></span></dt><dd><p>

     Novice users should be able to grasp quickly
     the rudiments of using <span class="application">SCons</span> to build their software.
     This extends to installing <span class="application">SCons</span>, too.
     Installation should be painless,
     and the installed <span class="application">SCons</span>
     should work "out of the box"
     to build most software.

    </p><p>

     This goal should be kept in mind during implementation,
     when there is always a tendency to try to optimize too early.
     Speed is nice, but not as important as clarity
     and ease of use.

    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Utility</code></span></dt><dd><p>

     <span class="application">SCons</span> should also provide a rich enough set of features
     to accommodate building more complicated software projects.
     However, the features required for
     building complicated software projects
     should not get in the way of novice users.
     (See the previous goal.)
     In other words, complexity should be available
     when it's needed
     but not required to get work done.
     Practically, this implies that <span class="application">SCons</span>
     shouldn't be dumbed down to the point it
     excludes complicated software builds.

    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Sharability</code></span></dt><dd><p>

     As a key element in balancing the conflicting
     needs of <code class="literal">Usability</code> and <code class="literal">Utility</code>,
     <span class="application">SCons</span> should provide mechanisms to
     allow <span class="application">SCons</span> users to share build rules,
     dependency scanners, and other objects and recipes
     for constructing software.
     A good sharing mechanism should support
     the model wherein most developers on a project
     use rules and templates
     that are created
     and maintained by a local integrator or build-master,

    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Extensibility</code></span></dt><dd><p>

     <span class="application">SCons</span> should provide mechanisms for
     easily extending its capabilities,
     including building new types of files,
     adding new types of dependency scanning,
     being able to accomodate dependencies
     between objects other than files,
     etc.

    </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Flexibility</code></span></dt><dd><p>

     In addition to providing a useful command-line interface,
     <span class="application">SCons</span> should provide the right architectural
     framework for embedding its dependency management
     in other interfaces.
     <span class="application">SCons</span> would help strengthen other GUIs or IDEs
     and the additional requirements of the
     other interfaces would help broaden and solidify
     the core <span class="application">SCons</span> dependency management.
